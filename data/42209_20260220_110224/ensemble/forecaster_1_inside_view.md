Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Longbridge/Business Wire (Feb 5, 2026):** Factual announcement that Q4/FY2025 earnings will be released pre-market on Feb 26, 2026, with 8:00 AM ET conference call. High quality, direct corporate communication. Highly relevant — earnings release coincides exactly with resolution date.

**Qnity Electronics IR Page:** Official investor relations page confirming Feb 26, 2026 earnings call at 8:00 AM EST. High quality, primary source. Confirms earnings catalyst on resolution date.

**Market Chameleon:** Blocked/inaccessible. No usable information.

**PR Newswire/NYSE (Nov 3, 2025):** Factual historical record of Q's NYSE trading debut following DuPont spinoff. High quality but historical context only. Useful for understanding company origins.

**StockTitan/DuPont (Nov 3, 2025):** Factual details of spinoff mechanics — 1 share Q per 2 DD shares, ~209M shares distributed, effective Nov 1, 2025. High quality historical context.

**Insider Monkey (undated):** Mentions RBC Capital reduced price target on Q but provides NO specific figures. Very low quality — primarily promotional content. Weak signal that at least one analyst has become more cautious.

**AskNews articles:** None of the AskNews articles are directly about Qnity Electronics (NYSE: Q). They cover Q2 Holdings (QTWO), Q Technology Group (HK), Q-Gold, Q Precious & Battery Metals, Qt Imaging, and cryptocurrency Q-USD. These are all different companies/assets with the same or similar ticker. **Zero direct relevance to Qnity Electronics (NYSE: Q).**

**Market context articles (Oct 2025, Dec 2025):** Historical market data from October-December 2025. The QQQ bearish signal article from Dec 2025 is outdated and not directly relevant. The S&P 500 was at ~6,881 as of Feb 18, 2026 (from the Italian market article), suggesting markets were near all-time highs.

**Outside view analysis sources (incorporated):** Yahoo Finance data shows previous close ~$115.25, day range $110.54-$115.10 on Feb 20; TradingView shows ~$112.86, beta 1.59, volatility 4.26%; Morningstar fair value $120 (raised from $100); analyst consensus 7 Strong Buy/1 Moderate Buy/1 Hold, average target ~$107-109; earnings Feb 26 pre-market.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Earnings release on Feb 26 pre-market (multiple confirmed sources):** This is the dominant factor. The resolution date coincides exactly with Q4/FY2025 earnings. This creates high binary variance — the stock will likely move significantly based on earnings quality. This is strong, confirmed, structurally important evidence. Direction uncertain, but magnitude likely large.
- **Stock has run up ~19-21% YTD and ~21% in 10 days before Feb 20 (from outside view analysis):** Pre-earnings run-ups historically create "sell the news" dynamics. Research consistently shows stocks that run up significantly into earnings tend to underperform on earnings day. This moderately lowers probability of being higher on Feb 26.
- **Current price (~$112-113) above analyst consensus target (~$107-109):** When stocks trade above analyst targets, the bar for positive earnings surprise is elevated. This is a moderate-to-strong downward pressure on probability.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Morningstar fair value raised to $120 (Feb 9, 2026):** Expert analyst with clear methodology sees upside from current levels. Suggests fundamental support for higher prices. Moderate upward pressure.
- **Analyst consensus: 7 Strong Buy, 1 Moderate Buy, 1 Hold:** Broadly bullish sentiment. However, consensus targets already below current price, limiting upside signal.
- **RBC Capital reduced price target (Insider Monkey):** Weak signal of at least one cautious analyst, but no specifics available.
- **S&P 500 at ~6,881 on Feb 18 (near highs):** Positive market backdrop. Moderate upward pressure on all stocks including Q.
- **Beta 1.59:** High sensitivity to market moves. In a positive market environment, amplifies upside; in negative, amplifies downside.

**Weak evidence:**
- **AI/semiconductor tailwinds:** General macro positive for the sector, but already priced in given the run-up.
- **Interim CFO:** Slight uncertainty for first standalone earnings, minor downward pressure.
- **Ex-dividend date ~Feb 27:** Minimal mechanical downward pressure (~$0.08 dividend).

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question covers Feb 20 close to Feb 26 close — approximately 4 trading days (Feb 23, 24, 25, 26). The earnings release pre-market on Feb 26 means the Feb 26 close will be almost entirely determined by the earnings reaction, not the intervening 3 trading days.

If the timeframe were halved (2 trading days, no earnings): Base rate ~52%, with slight downward pressure from run-up. Probability ~50%.

If the timeframe were doubled (8 trading days, earnings still on day 4): The post-earnings trend would dominate; if earnings are good, probability rises; if bad, falls. Similar uncertainty but with more time for recovery/continuation. Probability roughly similar ~49-51%.

The current timeframe is dominated by a single binary event (earnings on Feb 26), making this essentially a bet on whether Q4 earnings will be received positively by the market.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting point:** 49% outside view (slightly below base rate of 53% due to pre-earnings run-up and above-target pricing).

**Key adjustments:**

1. **Earnings on Feb 26 pre-market:** This is the pivotal factor. The stock's Feb 26 close will reflect market reaction to Q4/FY2025 results. This introduces high variance but doesn't systematically favor up or down — it depends on whether results beat/meet/miss expectations.

2. **Pre-earnings run-up creates elevated expectations:** The stock ran up ~21% in the 10 days before Feb 20. This suggests the market has already priced in optimism. For the stock to close higher on Feb 26 vs. Feb 20, earnings need to exceed already-elevated expectations. Historical research (e.g., from academic studies on earnings drift) suggests stocks that run up >15% in the month before earnings underperform on earnings day roughly 55-60% of the time. This pushes probability down slightly.

3. **Price above analyst targets:** Current ~$112-113 vs. consensus ~$107-109. This is unusual — stocks trading above consensus targets often face headwinds at earnings as the "good news" is already priced in. Slight downward pressure.

4. **Morningstar fair value $120:** Provides a credible bullish anchor. If the market agrees with Morningstar's assessment post-earnings, there's room to run. Slight upward pressure.

5. **First standalone earnings as Qnity Electronics:** Company was spun off in November 2025. This is effectively the first full-quarter earnings as an independent company. Markets may be uncertain about standalone financials, guidance, and cost structure. Slight uncertainty/downward pressure.

6. **Strong analyst buy consensus:** 7 Strong Buy ratings suggest fundamental support. But targets already below current price, so limited incremental upside from analyst upgrades.

**Net assessment:** The dominant uncertainty is the earnings outcome. The pre-earnings run-up and above-target pricing suggest the market has already priced in good news, making a "beat and raise" necessary for further upside. I estimate the probability of a positive earnings reaction (stock higher on Feb 26 vs. Feb 20) at approximately 45-48%, slightly below the base rate.

The Feb 20 close itself is uncertain (the question asks about Feb 20 close vs. Feb 26 close). If Feb 20 closes near the lower end of the day's range (~$110-111), the bar for Feb 26 to be higher is lower. If it closes near the top (~$115), the bar is higher. This uncertainty roughly washes out.

**Final estimate: 47%**

Probability calibration:

Starting from 49% outside view, I adjust slightly downward to 47% based on:
- Pre-earnings run-up creating elevated expectations (moderate downward pressure)
- Stock trading above analyst consensus targets (moderate downward pressure)
- First standalone earnings introducing uncertainty (slight downward pressure)
- Morningstar fair value $120 and strong buy consensus partially offsetting (slight upward pressure)
- No specific earnings guidance or whisper numbers available to further calibrate

The 47% estimate reflects genuine uncertainty — this is essentially a coin flip with slight tilt toward "No" due to elevated pre-earnings expectations.

Checklist:

1. **Resolution criteria:** Will Q (NYSE) close price on Feb 26, 2026 be higher than its close price on Feb 20, 2026? 4 trading days, earnings on Feb 26 pre-market.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 49% (slightly below 53% generic base rate due to pre-earnings run-up). Final prediction of 47% is rooted to this base rate with modest downward adjustment.

3. **Consistency check:** "47 out of 100 times, Q's Feb 26 close exceeds its Feb 20 close." This makes sense given the earnings uncertainty and elevated pre-earnings pricing.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - Earnings release pre-market Feb 26 (confirmed, high quality) — creates binary variance, direction uncertain
   - ~21% pre-earnings run-up in 10 days — historically associated with "sell the news" dynamics
   - Current price above analyst consensus targets (~$112 vs. ~$107-109) — elevated bar for positive reaction
   - Morningstar fair value $120 — credible bullish anchor
   - First standalone quarterly earnings — slight uncertainty premium

5. **Blind spot:** If Q4 earnings include a significant guidance raise (e.g., citing AI-driven semiconductor demand surge), the stock could rally 10-15% on earnings day, making my 47% look too pessimistic. This scenario would push probability toward 60%+. Conversely, a miss or cautious guidance could push it toward 35%.

6. **Status quo:** The stock has been in a strong uptrend. If earnings are in-line with elevated expectations, the status quo (higher prices) might continue. But "in-line" after a 21% run-up often results in a pullback. Slight nudge toward status quo (uptrend) would push to ~49%, but I maintain 47% given the elevated expectations risk.

Probability: 47%
