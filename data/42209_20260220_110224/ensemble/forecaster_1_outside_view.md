Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Yahoo Finance Quote Page (two versions):** Factual data snapshot showing previous close ~$115.25, day's range $110.54–$115.10, 52-week range $70.50–$117.69, earnings date Feb 26, 2026, ex-dividend date Feb 27, 2026. High quality factual source for price data. The bid/ask spread ($111 x $116) suggests the Feb 20 close is likely around $111–115 range.

**TradingView (NYSE-Q):** Shows current price ~$112.86, week change -2.26%, month change +20.10%, volatility 4.26%, beta 1.59. Confirms earnings Feb 26, 2026. Reliable factual data.

**CNBC Quote Page:** Last price $112.86 as of 02/19/26, 52-week high $117.69 on 02/12/26. Factual.

**Morningstar (Seth Goldstein, CFA, Feb 9, 2026):** Expert analyst raises fair value from $100 to $120, 3-star rating, narrow moat, high uncertainty. Credible expert opinion. Notes AI tailwinds and ~8% revenue growth forecast.

**MyChesCo (Feb 14, 2026):** Confirms Q4/FY-25 earnings release pre-market Feb 26, 2026, with 8:00 AM ET conference call. Factual.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive synthesis covering Jan 1–Feb 20, 2026. Notes ~19% YTD gain, 52-week high $117.69 on Feb 12, interim CFO appointed, analyst consensus 7 Strong Buy/1 Moderate Buy/1 Hold, average target ~$107–109 (below current price of ~$112.86). Identifies earnings Feb 26 as primary catalyst. Quality is good but relies on synthesized sources.

**FRED Data:** Semiconductor industrial production up 14.5% YoY in 2025. Confirms strong macro tailwind for semiconductor materials companies. Factual/high quality.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes apply:

1. **Any 5-trading-day stock price movement (generic):** Over any random 5-day window, stocks rise roughly 53-55% of the time (slightly above 50% due to equity risk premium). This is the broadest reference class.

2. **High-momentum stocks over a 5-day window:** Q has risen ~19-20% YTD and ~21% in the last 10 trading days before Feb 20. High-momentum stocks tend to continue short-term but also face mean reversion. Win rate may be slightly above 50%.

3. **Stocks with earnings announcements on the resolution date:** Earnings releases introduce significant binary uncertainty. Stocks with earnings on the resolution date have higher variance — they can gap significantly up or down. The question resolves on Feb 26, which is exactly when Q4 earnings are released pre-market. This is the most relevant reference class modifier.

4. **Post-run-up stocks into earnings:** Q has run up significantly (+19-21% in recent weeks) going into earnings. Stocks that have run up significantly before earnings tend to "sell the news" more often than not — perhaps 45-50% chance of being higher after earnings vs. 50-55% for a neutral stock.

The most suitable reference class: **stocks with earnings on the resolution date, after a significant pre-earnings run-up.** This suggests slightly below 50% probability of being higher.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question asks about Feb 20 close vs. Feb 26 close — a 4 trading day window (Feb 23, 24, 25, 26). 

Key dynamics:
- Feb 20 close: Based on the Yahoo Finance data showing previous close $115.25 and day's range $110.54–$115.10, the Feb 20 close is likely somewhere in the $110–115 range. Given the bid/ask of $111/$116 and the day's range, a reasonable estimate for Feb 20 close is approximately $111–113.
- Feb 26 is earnings day (pre-market release). This is the dominant factor.
- Ex-dividend date appears to be Feb 27 (per Yahoo Finance) or possibly Feb 25 (per agent report). If ex-div is Feb 26 or 27, there's a small mechanical downward pressure (~$0.08).

Historical patterns for 4-5 day windows: ~53% chance of being higher for a typical stock. But with earnings on the final day, variance is much higher.

The stock is trading above analyst consensus targets (~$107-109), suggesting the bar for a positive earnings surprise to push the stock higher is elevated. The last EPS beat was 13% above estimates ($0.74 vs $0.65 estimate). If Q4 similarly beats, the stock could rally. If it meets or misses, profit-taking after the big run-up is likely.

**(d) Justification**

Key factors:
- **Base rate:** ~53% for any 5-day window
- **Earnings catalyst (Feb 26):** High uncertainty, binary outcome. Pre-market earnings release means the Feb 26 close will largely reflect earnings reaction.
- **Pre-earnings run-up:** Stock up ~21% in 10 days before Feb 20. This creates "sell the news" risk. Research suggests stocks that run up significantly into earnings underperform on earnings day.
- **Stock above analyst targets:** Current price ~$112-113 vs. average analyst target $107-109. This means even bullish analysts see limited upside, raising the bar for a positive reaction.
- **Strong momentum and AI tailwinds:** Positive macro environment for semiconductor materials.
- **Morningstar fair value $120:** Suggests room to run if fundamentals confirm.
- **DCF concerns:** SimplyWallSt's $58.82 DCF suggests significant overvaluation risk.
- **Interim CFO:** Slight execution/disclosure risk for first standalone earnings.
- **High beta (1.59):** Amplifies market moves in either direction.
- **Analyst consensus:** 7 Strong Buy, 1 Moderate Buy, 1 Hold — broadly bullish.

Balancing these factors: The earnings event on Feb 26 is the dominant uncertainty. The pre-earnings run-up and above-target pricing suggest the market has already priced in good news, making a "beat and raise" necessary for further upside. The probability of being higher on Feb 26 vs. Feb 20 is roughly at or slightly below the base rate of 53%.

I estimate approximately 48-50% probability of the Feb 26 close being higher than the Feb 20 close.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for a stock being higher over a 4-5 trading day window is approximately 53%. However, several factors pull this down:
- The stock has run up significantly (+21% in 10 days) before earnings, creating sell-the-news risk
- Current price exceeds analyst consensus targets, raising the bar for positive reaction
- Earnings on the exact resolution date introduces high binary variance
- Interim CFO adds slight uncertainty

Factors that could push probability up:
- Strong momentum
- Positive AI/semiconductor macro
- Morningstar fair value at $120
- Strong analyst buy consensus
- Previous quarter showed 13% EPS beat

The competing forces roughly cancel, landing near the base rate but slightly below given the elevated expectations already priced in. I'll estimate 49%.

Outside View Prediction:
49%
