**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes apply:

1. **Short-term stock price movement (5 trading days):** Any given stock rises over a 5-day window roughly 50-55% of the time historically (slight upward drift in equities). Base rate: ~52-54%.

2. **Stock with upcoming earnings announcement:** Stocks with earnings announcements in the resolution window have higher variance. The stock could move significantly either direction. Historically, stocks with earnings in the window show slightly higher probability of upward movement if pre-earnings sentiment is positive (buy the rumor), but also higher risk of post-earnings selloff.

3. **High-beta semiconductor materials stock (beta 1.59):** Higher beta means amplified market moves in both directions. The question window is Feb 20-26 (5 trading days).

4. **Stock already above analyst consensus target:** Q at ~$112-115 is above the mean analyst target of $107-109. This suggests limited upside from analyst upgrades and potential for profit-taking.

The most suitable reference class is **"5-day stock price movement with earnings announcement during the window"** - this captures the key dynamics.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question asks whether Q's close on Feb 26 will be higher than its close on Feb 20. That's a 5-trading-day window (Feb 20 to Feb 26).

Key factors:
- The Feb 20 close price is the baseline (the question opened Feb 20). Based on the data, the stock was trading around $111-115 on Feb 19-20.
- Earnings are released pre-market Feb 26 - this is the dominant catalyst
- Ex-dividend date is around Feb 25-27 (mechanical ~$0.08 downward pressure)
- Beta of 1.59 means ~1.59x market moves

Historical patterns for 5-day windows with earnings:
- Pre-earnings drift: Often slight positive drift as optimists position
- Post-earnings: Highly variable; with stock above analyst targets, a "sell the news" reaction is plausible
- Earnings surprise history: Last quarter beat EPS by 13% ($0.74 vs $0.65 estimate)

**(d) Justification**

**Factors favoring YES (price higher on Feb 26 vs Feb 20):**
- Strong momentum (+19% YTD, +21% in 10 days)
- Analyst consensus overwhelmingly bullish (7 Strong Buy)
- Previous earnings beat (13% positive surprise)
- Morningstar fair value $120 (above current price)
- Strong semiconductor industry tailwinds (AI, advanced nodes)
- Pre-earnings positioning often positive

**Factors favoring NO (price lower on Feb 26 vs Feb 20):**
- Stock already above mean analyst target (~$107-109 vs ~$113-115 current)
- High valuation uncertainty (SimplyWallSt DCF: $58.82)
- Earnings results are binary and uncertain
- Stock near 52-week high ($117.69 on Feb 12) - potential resistance
- Ex-dividend effect (~$0.08 mechanical drag, minor)
- High beta (1.59) amplifies any market weakness
- "Sell the news" risk after strong pre-earnings run
- Interim CFO adds execution/disclosure risk
- FY25 EPS consensus was very low ($0.54) with "99% collapse" noted - though this may be a data artifact

The critical uncertainty is the earnings outcome on Feb 26. The stock has run up significantly pre-earnings, which historically creates a higher bar for positive reaction. However, the previous quarter showed a 13% beat, suggesting management may be conservative in guidance.

The base rate for a 5-day positive return is ~52-54%. The earnings event adds significant variance but the pre-earnings run-up and stock being above analyst targets slightly tilts toward "sell the news" risk. However, the strong bullish sentiment and previous beat history partially offset this.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for any 5-day positive stock return is approximately 52-54%. 

Adjustments:
- Earnings announcement (high variance event): Slightly increases uncertainty, roughly neutral on direction
- Stock above analyst consensus targets: Mild negative adjustment (-2-3%)
- Strong pre-earnings momentum: Slight positive but "buy the rumor, sell the news" risk
- Previous earnings beat: Slight positive (+2%)
- High beta in uncertain market: Slight negative
- Bullish analyst consensus: Slight positive (+1-2%)
- Near 52-week high: Slight negative (-1%)

Net adjustments roughly cancel out, leaving me close to the base rate of ~52%, perhaps slightly below given the "above analyst targets" and "sell the news" dynamics.

I'll estimate approximately 50-52% probability of YES.

Outside View Prediction:
51%
