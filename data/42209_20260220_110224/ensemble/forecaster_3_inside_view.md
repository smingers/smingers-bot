Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Will Qnity Electronics (Q) close on 2026-02-26 higher than its close on 2026-02-20 (Yahoo Finance close-to-close comparison; split-adjusted if needed)?

(a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; date)
- Business Wire / Longbridge summary (2026-02-05): States Q will report Q4/FY2025 results pre-market on Feb 26 with an 8:00am ET call. High-quality factual (company PR distribution). Highly relevant because it creates a known price-moving catalyst on the resolution date.
- Qnity IR Events & Presentations page (accessed for Feb 26 listing): Confirms the Feb 26 earnings call/webcast timing. High-quality primary source; factual; highly relevant.
- PR Newswire NYSE advisory (2025-11-03): Notes Q began trading after DuPont spinoff. High-quality, but mostly background; little direct bearing on the 6-day directional move.
- StockTitan separation release (2025-11-03): Factual spinoff details and generic risk-factor boilerplate. Medium relevance (context only).
- InsiderMonkey “RBC reduces PT” (undated in excerpt; appears recent): Headline claim without details in body; low evidentiary value (can’t verify magnitude/rationale). Treat as weak.
- AskNews/Stockpulse snippets: Mostly about other tickers using “Q” (crypto Q-USD; HK:1478; QTWO; QTI; etc.). Low relevance to NYSE:Q and should largely be discarded for this question.
- Older macro/market commentary (IBTimes Oct 2025; Barchart Dec 2025; SoldiOnline Feb 19 2026 Europe open): General market color; dated or indirect. Weak-to-moderate at best for a specific single-stock 5-trading-day move.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence:
- A discrete, scheduled, pre-market earnings release on Feb 26 (Business Wire + IR page). This is a direct causal mechanism for a potentially large same-day move that dominates the resolution-day close direction.

Moderate evidence:
- “Setup into earnings” dynamics: in short windows, earnings-day repricing tends to swamp ordinary drift; direction depends on expectations vs results, and on guidance tone. (General historical pattern; applies strongly given timing.)
- Prior outside-view context (provided): Q has had a strong run-up and is near recent highs, and is (reportedly) above average Street price target. If true, that increases the “high bar”/sell-the-news risk.

Weak evidence:
- RBC price target reduction as presented (InsiderMonkey) because the key factual details are missing.
- Broad-market articles and unrelated “Q” tickers (Stockpulse/AskNews) for directionality—too noisy/irrelevant.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Window length: from today (2026-02-20 close) to 2026-02-26 close ≈ 6 calendar days, typically 4–5 trading sessions, with earnings pre-market on the final day.
- If halved (to ~2–3 trading days, ending before earnings): I’d expect a slightly higher “Yes” probability (more ordinary upward drift / positioning, less earnings-jump risk).
- If doubled (to ~2 weeks, including post-earnings digestion): I’d expect mean-reversion and broader market/sector factors to matter more; direction would depend heavily on guidance and subsequent analyst revisions (harder to call from today).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside-view base rate)
Outside view base rate (given): 51% Yes for a 5-trading-day rise.

Key inside-view update: the resolution date coincides with a pre-market earnings release, making Feb 26’s close much more dependent on the earnings surprise + guidance than on ordinary drift.

How this shifts the base rate:
- Earnings-day outcomes are closer to a “coin flip with fat tails” than a gentle upward-drift process; without strong evidence that expectations are low, I avoid pushing “Yes” above base rate.
- The provided outside-view context indicates (i) recent strength/near highs and (ii) trading above average analyst target—conditions that often create asymmetric downside on “merely okay” earnings (sell-the-news / de-risking), even if the long-term story is intact.
- Offsetting: there is also evidence of generally positive sentiment around the company (spin-off narrative; bullish-leaning coverage in the outside-view set), which prevents me from moving too far below 50%.

Net: I make a small downward adjustment from 51% to reflect (1) earnings-day dominance and (2) “high bar”/sell-the-news risk given the alleged rich pricing vs targets—without overreacting due to lack of concrete consensus/whisper numbers in the sources provided.

Probability calibration
- Start from outside view: 51% Yes.
- Adjustments:
  - Earnings on resolution day increases variance and reduces the value of “drift” (+/− ~0 directionally; but makes me cautious about >50% absent a clear edge): ~0 to -1%.
  - “High bar” setup (run-up / above average PT per outside-view notes): -1% to -2%.
  - Lack of reliable negative fundamental news in the provided sources (prevents larger drop): +0% to +1%.
- Final inside-view: 49% Yes.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Q close on Feb 26 > Q close on Feb 20 (Yahoo close prices; split-adjusted).  
2. Outside view base rate: 51% Yes.  
3. Consistency: 49 out of 100 times, Q’s Feb 26 close is higher than its Feb 20 close.  
4. Top evidence (3–5):
   - Earnings released pre-market Feb 26 (direct price-moving catalyst on resolution day).
   - Earnings-day repricing typically dominates a 4–5 trading day window.
   - Reported setup: stock strong/near highs and (reportedly) above average analyst target → higher sell-the-news risk.
5. Blind spot: A clearly strong beat + upbeat 2026 guidance could trigger a large gap-up, making “Yes” much more likely than I’m pricing.  
6. Status quo outcome: Absent earnings, I’d lean slightly “Yes” due to equity drift; earnings-day uncertainty nudges me back below 50%.

Probability: 49%
