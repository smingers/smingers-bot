Analysis:

1. Source analysis (facts vs. opinions, quality, date)

a) Yahoo Finance quote page (snap-shot 19–20 Feb 26).  Hard market data: last close 111.69, earnings date 26 Feb 26, ex-div 27 Feb 26.  High-quality factual feed, minimal opinion.

b) Business Wire press release, 5 Feb 26.  Confirms Q will release Q4/FY25 results pre-market 26 Feb 26.  Primary source, purely factual.

c) Qnity investor-relations Events page (visited 20 Feb 26).  Re-states the same earnings-call logistics.  Company site, factual.

d) Morningstar analyst note, 9 Feb 26.  Gives fair-value estimate $120 (vs 111.69) and “undervalued” opinion.  Identified expert, moderate quality opinion.

e) Insider Monkey headline (undated, surfaced 17 Feb 26) about RBC lowering its target.  No numbers given; low information content, weak quality opinion.

f) Stockpulse short-horizon price snippets (18-20 Feb 26) showing Q rose 1-3 % intraday on thin commentary.  Automated feed; factual for the specific prints but noisy, limited predictive value.

No other retrieved items refer to Qnity Electronics specifically.

2. Evidence analysis (weighting)

Strong evidence:
– None (no hard data yet on earnings).

Moderate evidence:
– Scheduled earnings before the bell on the resolution date → large move very likely, direction uncertain but variance high.
– Morningstar $120 FV implies modest 7-8 % upside vs last close (mildly bullish) from named analyst.

Weak evidence:
– RBC target cut (details missing) points slightly bearish.
– Tiny pre-earnings drift in the last two sessions (+1-2 %) hints at neutral-to-positive sentiment.
– General S&P-500 upward drift over four-day windows (~52-53 % probability of gain).

3. Timeframe analysis
Time until resolution: exactly 4 trading days (20 → 26 Feb 26).  If the window were halved to 2 days, the scheduled catalyst disappears and the drift bias would raise the probability a point or two.  If doubled to 8 trading days (crossing ex-div date & macro prints), noise increases; probability would migrate back toward 50 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustments

Outside-view base rate for an S&P 500 constituent over four sessions ≈ 52 %.  
Earnings events historically raise absolute move size but leave direction very close to a coin flip (~50 %).  
Pre-earnings drift is weakly positive (academic studies put it at +1–2 % average), nudging probability upward 1–2 pp.  
Morningstar’s undervaluation call adds perhaps another 1 pp.  
RBC’s undisclosed target cut subtracts ≈ 1 pp given poor detail.  
Net adjustment from 51.7 % base: +1.3 pp → 53 %.

5. Scenario decomposition

Yes outcome drivers: (i) earnings beat or upbeat 2026 guidance; (ii) continued AI/semicap macro bid; (iii) pre-earnings accumulation.

No outcome drivers: (i) earnings miss, soft gross-margin commentary, PFAS liability talk; (ii) macro risk-off or sector rotation; (iii) traders de-risk into the print.

Expected market status quo if nothing special: slight upward bias.

Probability calibration
I expect that roughly 53 out of 100 similar situations would see Q close higher on 26 Feb 26 than on 20 Feb 26.  Edge is small; uncertainty is high due to binary earnings reaction.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will Q’s NYSE closing price on Thu 26 Feb 26 exceed its Fri 20 Feb 26 close?”  
2. Outside view base: 51.7 %.  
3. Consistency: “53 of 100 times, the 26 Feb close will be higher.”  
4. Key evidence (short):  
   – Earnings released pre-market on resolution date (moderate, uncertain direction).  
   – General 4-day S&P drift slightly positive.  
   – Morningstar $120 FV vs 112 price (mild bullish).  
   – Minimal positive price drift 18-20 Feb.  
5. Blind-spot: large negative surprise (e.g., PFAS litigation charge) causing >10 % drop; would swing probability sharply below 40 %.  
6. Status-quo: no major news → slight upward drift; ergo a small upward lean is logical.

Probability: 53%
