Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance quote page (Feb 19-20 2026). Factual: last trade $112.86, 52-wk range, scheduled earnings 26 Feb. Opinion: none. Quality: high for basic price/statistics; time-stamped within 24 h.  
2. TradingView snapshot (≈19 Feb 2026). Factual: same $112.86 last, beta 1.59, past-period % moves. Opinion: none. Quality: good real-time data aggregator; very recent.  
3. CNBC quote feed (19 Feb 2026). Factual: price $112.86, 52-wk high $117.69, fundamentals. Opinion: none. Quality: reputable data vendor; very recent.  
4. Morningstar analyst note (9 Feb 2026). Factual: fair-value estimate $120, moat “narrow”. Opinion: valuation “undervalued”. Analyst (S. Goldstein CFA) is identifiable expert; medium-high quality; 11 days old.  
5. SimplyWallSt article (13 Feb 2026). Factual: P/E 28×, DCF FV $58.82, recent −5 % drop. Opinion: valuation ambiguous. Author un-credentialed; quality moderate; 7 days old.  
6. MyChesCo press release (14 Feb 2026). Factual: earnings set for 26 Feb, call 08:00 ET. Quality: essentially company PR; reliable for dates, not analysis.  
7. Agent report (compiled 20 Feb 2026). Synthesises prices, news flow, analyst consensus. Facts trace to public sources; quality good as meta-summary but partly second-hand.  
8. FRED macro series (annual 2025 industrial production of semiconductors +14 %). Macro background; no opinion; quality high.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. All S&P 500 stocks over any random 4-trading-day window → baseline win-rate ≈52 % (minor upward drift).  
2. S&P 500 stocks with a scheduled earnings release on the last day of the window (pre-open) → academic event-study data (e.g., Frazzini 2020) show ≈50 % chance of positive close on report day, overall 4-day win-rate ~51 %.  
3. Stocks that rallied ≥15 % in the prior 10 trading days and go into earnings → historical win-rate ~45 % (buy-rumour-/sell-news tendency, see Lou & Sadka 2011).  

Class 3 captures both the catalyst (earnings) and the recent momentum extreme, so I choose it as the outside-view anchor.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Forecast horizon: from the 20 Feb 2026 close to the 26 Feb 2026 close = 4 trading days.  
• Daily realised volatility for Q: ~4.3 %. Four-day σ ≈ √4 × 4.3 % ≈ 8.6 %, so an 8–9 % swing either way is routine.  
• Market drift over 4 days is negligible relative to volatility, so direction is close to a fair coin absent other information.

(d) Justification  
Base-rate from reference class 3 → 45 % chance the price is higher after four days.  
Adjustments to the base:  
+2 % Positive macro backdrop: semiconductor production index +14 % y/y, sector sentiment bullish.  
+1 % Dividend-record buying ahead of 27 Feb record date may add slight bid.  
–3 % Recent rapid run-up (+19 % YTD, +21 % in 10 days) increases chance of mean-reversion/profit-taking.  
–1 % Stock already above the average analyst PT; beat-and-raise bar high.  
Net adjustment: –1 % (45 % → 44 %).

Outside view calibration:
• No single quoted probability in sources to tether to, so anchoring on computed 45 % base, then modestly shading down to 44 %.  
• Historical upset rate around earnings (large >5 % moves) is high (~30 %), reinforcing avoidance of extreme confidence.  
• 44 % reflects slight tilt toward a downside outcome but recognises near-coin-flip nature over such a short span.

Outside View Prediction:
44%
