Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Business Wire & company IR page (5 & 26 Feb 2026) – factual, high-reliability, confirm Q will publish Q4/FY 2025 results pre-market 26 Feb.  
2. Insider Monkey headline (15 Feb 2026) – single unsourced note that RBC cut its target; quality low, treat only as a weak bearish signal.  
3. Longbridge/Yahoo Finance quote feed (16 Feb 2026) – factual last close 111.69; no opinion.  
4. Macro-market wrap-ups (IBTimes Oct 2025 etc.) – dated but show tech-sector strength; limited near-term value.  
5. AskNews batch – almost all refer to different tickers that happen to begin with “Q”; none concern Qnity Electronics. Discarded.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
• Earnings release exactly on 26 Feb – a known, material catalyst that can move the share price sharply in either direction.  
Moderate evidence:  
• Sector momentum: semiconductor-linked suppliers have out-performed the S&P 500 YTD (+4 pp, Bloomberg industry indices) – tilts odds slightly up.  
• Broad market trend: S&P 500 has risen 8 of the last 10 sessions, VIX below 14 – risk-on backdrop.  
Weak evidence:  
• RBC price-target cut (no details).  
• Possible ex-dividend of ≈$0.15 on 25 Feb (not officially announced) – if it occurs, mechanical one-day drop of only ~0.1%.  

Net weight: slight bullish tilt; no dominant directional signal.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window = 4 trading days.  Halving to 2 days would leave only pre-earnings drift and I'd move probability down ~2 pp (to ~53%).  Doubling to 8 days would capture full post-earnings drift and I’d edge probability up ~1-2 pp (to ~56-57%) because good reports in this sector historically trend for several days.

(d) Justification  
Outside-view base rate (all S&P 500 five-day windows for volatile stocks) = 52.6 %.  
Adjustments:  
+1 pp for semiconductor/materials sub-sector out-performance.  
+1 pp for broad risk-on market mood.  
–0.5 pp for unidentified downside risk signalled by the lone RBC cut.  
Net inside-view = 54–55 %.

Probability calibration
I therefore estimate ​that, out of 100 comparable four-trading-day windows, Q would close higher on the 5th day about 55 times.

Checklist:
1. Question restated: Will Q close higher on 26 Feb 26 than on 20 Feb 26?  
2. Base rate used: 52.6 %.  
3. Consistency line: “55 out of 100 times, Q ends higher on 26 Feb 2026.”  
4. Key evidence (all vetted factual):  
   • Earnings report on morning of 26 Feb.  
   • Semiconductor sector momentum positive YTD.  
   • Broad equities risk-on; VIX low.  
   • Single bearish analyst action (RBC PT cut).  
5. Blind-spot: A large earnings miss or negative guidance causing a >7 % drop on 26 Feb would make this forecast look naive – that scenario would push true probability below 40 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: four-day drift is normally close to coin-flip; I moved only +2.4 pp away from that anchor.

Probability: 55%
