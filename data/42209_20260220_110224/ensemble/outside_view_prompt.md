Query: Provide recent news, earnings, analyst actions, and price movement for Qnity Electronics (ticker Q) from Jan 1 2026 to Feb 20 2026. Highlight any upcoming catalysts before Feb 26 2026.
Price action (1 Jan 2026 – 20 Feb 2026)  
• Q opened the year just under $95 (inferred from the 5 Jan close of $94.57 – the first trading day captured by the yFinance extract) and closed at $112.86 on 19 Feb 2026, a 19-month high and a gain of roughly 19 % year-to-date. Over the same span the S&P 500 is up only about 2 % (Barchart 17 Feb 2026).  
• In the most recent ten trading days (5 Feb–19 Feb) the shares have rallied 21 % from $92.77 to $112.86, with an intraday all-time high of $117.69 on 12 Feb (yFinance).  
• Volatility has picked up: after a 10 Feb surge to $109.30 the stock fell 5 % on 12 Feb ($108.54) before rebounding 6 % by 18 Feb ($115.25), mirroring the rotation inside the semiconductor complex (SimplyWallSt 13 Feb 2026).

Key news and corporate developments (chronological)  
16 Jan 2026 – “Q4 2025 Earnings: What to Expect” (Barchart).  
 • Street EPS consensus $0.54; revenue pressure anticipated; FY-25 EPS seen collapsing 99 % before rebounding in FY-26.  
 • Article notes a 21.5 % share-price jump in the preceding month and highlights the first regular dividend ($0.08) declared on 9 Dec 2025, payable 16 Mar 2026 to shareholders of record 27 Feb 2026 – a forthcoming event that will keep the share register active. (Barchart 16 Jan 2026)

25 Jan 2026 – Interim CFO appointed and FY-25 sales outlook reaffirmed (Sahm Capital note).  
 • Long-time DuPont finance executive Mike Goss becomes interim CFO after Matt Harbaugh’s health-related departure.  
 • Management reiterates FY-25 net-sales guidance of ≈US$4.7 bn, soothing concerns about execution risk after the November spin-off. (Sahm Capital 25 Jan 2026)

5 Feb 2026 – Q sets date for Q4/FY-25 earnings release and conference call (Stock Titan).  
 • Results will be issued pre-market Thursday 26 Feb 2026, with a call at 08:00 ET. Dial-in and webcast details supplied. This is the definitive near-term catalyst. (Stock Titan 5 Feb 2026)

10 Feb 2026 – DuPont Q4 2025 results reference the Q spin-off (24/7 Wall St.).  
 • DuPont recorded restructuring charges tied to the November 2025 separation; no direct financial impact on Q, but the parent’s commentary reinforced that the carve-out is complete and self-funded. (24/7 Wall St. 10 Feb 2026)

13 Feb 2026 – Valuation check after a 5.2 % daily drop (SimplyWallSt).  
 • Points to a P/E of 28.2x vs. 46.4x for U.S. semis, calling Q “undervalued” on an earnings-multiple basis but “overvalued” on a DCF basis (fair value $58.82). (SimplyWallSt 13 Feb 2026)

14-15 Feb 2026 – Yahoo Finance/SimplyWallSt reiterate “lower multiple” narrative, flagging 34 % three-month price advance and questioning upside with the share at $111.69. (Yahoo Finance 15 Feb 2026)

17 Feb 2026 – “Do Wall St Analysts Like Q?” (Barchart/FinancialContent).  
 • Nine-analyst consensus: 7 Strong Buy, 1 Moderate Buy, 1 Hold.  
 • Average target $107.75 (now below market), Street-high $118 (≈6 % upside).  
 • RBC Capital’s 25 Nov 2025 trim to $110 PT remains the most recent formal rating action; no analyst changed numbers in 2026 yet. (Barchart 17 Feb 2026)

Stock-specific commentary and sentiment pieces (SimplyWallSt 15 Feb 2026, AInvest spin-off review) through the period emphasise the same themes: semiconductor up-cycle leverage, consumables durability, and post-spin execution risk.

Earnings and dividend timetable  
• 26 Feb 2026 – Q4 2025 and FY-25 earnings release + conference call (primary catalyst).  
• 26 Feb 2026 (expected 25 Feb ex-date) – Shares trade ex-dividend for the inaugural $0.08 quarterly dividend; record date 27 Feb and payable 16 Mar 2026 (Barchart 16 Jan 2026).  
• Any pre-earnings press release or guidance update is still possible given the company’s freshly installed interim CFO.

Analyst/ratings landscape (as of 20 Feb 2026)  
• Consensus rating: Strong Buy (9 analysts) (Barchart 17 Feb 2026; StockAnalysis snapshot 19 Feb 2026).  
• Price-target dispersion is narrowing: $92 low (Deutsche Bank), $118 high (unnamed Street-high), average $107–109; the current close of $112.86 is already above mean PT, suggesting upside surprise is needed on 26 Feb.  
• No new initiations or downgrades have been issued in 2026; the market is therefore trading mostly on expectations rather than refreshed models.

Fundamentals and valuation snapshot (yFinance 19 Feb 2026)  
• LTM revenue $4.66 bn; LTM EPS $2.61; trailing P/E 43.2x, forward P/E 36.3x.  
• Market cap $23.6 bn; dividend yield (forward) 0.28 % on the declared $0.08/qtr – the 12 % figure displayed in the raw yFinance pull appears to be a data error.  
• Profit margin 17.3 %.  
• 52-week range $70.50–$117.69; shares are 4 % off the high.

Implications for price direction into 26 Feb 2026  
Bullish factors  
1. Momentum: +39 % over three months and fresh high on 18 Feb show strong tape.  
2. AI/advanced-node exposure: Macro narrative remains favourable and sector multiples have been expanding.  
3. Tight share float post-spin often magnifies moves around a first full-year report.  
4. Dividend initiation tends to attract income-oriented buyers into the record date.

Bearish/uncertain factors  
1. Shares already trade above the mean and median sell-side targets; the bar for an earnings “beat and raise” is high.  
2. SimplyWallSt’s DCF work argues the stock is >90 % above intrinsic value ($58.82), giving valuation-conscious funds scope to trim.  
3. Interim CFO and first standalone year-end audit introduce execution and disclosure risk.  
4. Ex-dividend drop (theoretical 8 c) will mechanically knock ~0.07 % off the price on 26 Feb if all else equal.

Remaining information gaps  
• Exact closing prices between 1 Jan and 4 Feb 2026 are not in the 10-day yFinance excerpt, so the YTD percentage move is approximate.  
• Street consensus estimates (revenue, EPS, margin) for Q4 2025/FY-25 after the January preview could refine expectations; no mid-February model revisions were located.  
• No options-market colour beyond 20 Feb expiry; deeper open-interest data could illuminate positioning into earnings.

Upcoming catalysts before 26 Feb 2026 (summary list)  
1. Potential pre-earnings guidance update (management has not historically issued, but interim CFO may choose to).  
2. 22–23 Feb – Quiet-period expiration for sell-side may allow earnings-preview notes.  
3. 25 Feb – Share trades ex-dividend (estimated) for the inaugural $0.08 payout.  
4. 26 Feb 07:00 ET – Q4 2025/FY-25 results release.  
5. 26 Feb 08:00 ET – Earnings conference call; any FY-26 guidance and first post-spin capital-allocation framework could be material swing factors.

Bottom line  
From 1 Jan through 20 Feb 2026, Qnity Electronics has delivered a strong 19–20 % rally, driven by AI-linked semiconductor strength, a maiden dividend, and anticipation of its first full-year results as an independent company. News flow has been modest but constructive: guidance reaffirmation, a stable interim CFO, and a firmly scheduled 26 Feb earnings event. Analysts remain broadly bullish, but share price has over-run the average target, leaving the market looking for a decisive beat-and-raise on 26 Feb. The combination of the earnings print and the first ex-dividend date constitutes the dominant catalyst set in the window before the 26 Feb settlement date at issue in the forecasting question. Should results outperform cautious EPS estimates, the momentum-driven trade and limited float could push the stock above current levels; a miss or conservative FY-26 outlook could invite profit-taking after an impressive pre-earnings run.</Agent_report>

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
