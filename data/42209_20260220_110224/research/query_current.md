Analysis:
To judge whether Q’s share price will be higher on 2026-02-26 than on 2026-02-20, I need very recent catalysts likely to move the stock over the next few trading days:  
• Any imminent earnings release, conference call, or pre-announcement (positive or negative).  
• Fresh analyst upgrades/downgrades or price-target changes.  
• Sector-wide semiconductor news (new export rules, demand outlook, supply-chain issues).  
• Macro factors (S&P 500 direction, interest-rate expectations) that could affect a large-cap chip-materials supplier.  
Therefore, I’ll look for breaking or very recent articles (past 24–48 h) on Qnity Electronics itself plus broader semiconductor market sentiment between now and 26 Feb 2026.
