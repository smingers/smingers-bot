Here's Why This Candlestick is a Bearish Confirmation.**\nThe article analyzes the recent price action of the QQQ ETF, suggesting that the bull run beginning in April 2025 may have ended. It notes that QQQ opened higher than the previous week\u2019s close and reached a new high, but then reversed, forming a lower low and closing lower\u2014by just one tick. This pattern indicates bearish sentiment, with more sellers than buyers. Early price action on the day confirmed this, as QQQ gapped higher but then reversed, breaking below Friday\u2019s low of 611.36. The article predicts a potential test of the November 23 gap at 590.07 and possibly the November 17 low of 580.74. A daily close above 619.25 would negate the bearish signal, while a weekly close above last week\u2019s high would indicate a potential retest of all-time highs (ATHs). However, the combination of a new lower high and a new weekly low suggests that bears are currently in control, and the market is likely entering a consolidation phase\u2014or possibly a bearish trend. According to the article, the bull run from April is over.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 15, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36629283/did-the-qqq-bull-run-just-end-heres-why-this-candlestick-is-a-bearish-confirmation)\n\n**Market Close Stock Round Up Oct. 24, 2025: Wall Street Rallies as Cooling Inflation Boosts Rate-Cut Hopes**\nOn October 24, 2025, Wall Street rallied as fresh inflation data showed price pressures cooling faster than expected, boosting hopes for an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
