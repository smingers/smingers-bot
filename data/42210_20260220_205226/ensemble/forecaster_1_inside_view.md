Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Alphaquery (Earnings History):** High-quality factual source. Shows Ford missed Q4 2025 EPS ($0.13 actual vs $0.17 estimated). Historical earnings trend is factual and reliable. The miss after four consecutive beats is notable context.

2. **Stockinsights.ai (8-K filing index):** Moderate quality — navigation/index page only. Lists key events (earnings call Feb 10, pension remeasurement Jan 29, EV strategy changes Dec 2025). Factual but limited in analytical depth.

4. **Morningstar (Feb 17, 2026):** High-quality expert analysis from named analyst David Whiston, CFA. Fair value estimate $16.00, 3-star rating (fairly valued). Confirms 2026 EBIT guidance details, Novelis impact ($1B drag in 2026), and strong liquidity ($49.8B). Expert opinion from credible, identifiable source.

7. **CoinCentral (Jan 1, 2026):** Ford ended 2025 at $13.12. Historical price data, reliable. Shows Ford was at $13.12 at year-end 2025, now trading ~$13.78-14.12 range.

8. **Other Stockpulse articles:** Cover unrelated tickers (FSBW, FFIV, Korean stocks, etc.) — not relevant to Ford Motor (F) analysis.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- Ford's Feb 20 close appears to be approximately $13.78 (per Stockpulse data showing -0.51% from ~$13.85 prior close). The question creation note says $14.12 as of Feb 16, but the Feb 20 Stockpulse article shows $13.78. This means the Feb 20 close is the baseline for resolution — approximately $13.78.
- Morningstar's fair value estimate of $16.00 (expert, named analyst) suggests meaningful upside from current levels, which is a moderate-to-strong bullish signal.
- Ford's 2026 EBIT guidance of $8–$10B (midpoint ~32% above 2025 adjusted EBIT) is confirmed by multiple sources — this is a positive fundamental catalyst already partially priced in.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Post-earnings positive reaction (stock up 2.1% on Feb 11) has partially faded by Feb 20 (trading at $13.78 vs $13.85 close on Feb 11-12). Momentum has softened slightly.
- Stock is trading above its 200-day SMA ($12.13), indicating positive medium-term trend.
- Q4 2025 EPS miss ($0.13 vs $0.17 estimated) is a negative, but market already absorbed this (stock rose post-earnings on guidance).
- The $14.12 price mentioned in question creation (Feb 16) vs ~$13.78 on Feb 20 suggests a ~2.4% pullback in the days leading up to Feb 20, which could indicate some near-term selling pressure.

**Weak evidence:**
- No specific news catalysts identified for the Feb 23-26 week from available sources.
- Broad market context (S&P 500 near highs) is mildly supportive but not Ford-specific.
- EV strategy pivot toward hybrids is a longer-term narrative, not a near-term catalyst.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question covers Feb 20 close vs Feb 26 close — effectively 4 trading days (Feb 23, 24, 25, 26). This is a very short window.

- **If halved (2 trading days):** Probability would move closer to 50%, as there's less time for any directional trend to manifest. Short-term noise dominates.
- **If doubled (8 trading days):** Probability would increase slightly toward 55-57%, as the positive fundamental backdrop (Morningstar $16 target, strong 2026 guidance) would have more time to influence price.

The 4-day window is dominated by random walk dynamics. The slight positive tilt from fundamentals and momentum is real but modest.

**(d) Justification**

Starting from the outside view base rate of 54%:

**Upward adjustments:**
- Morningstar fair value of $16 vs ~$13.78 current price suggests ~16% upside per expert analysis (+1-2%)
- Strong 2026 EBIT guidance already confirmed and well-received (+1%)
- Stock above 200-day SMA, indicating positive medium-term trend (+1%)

**Downward adjustments:**
- Stock pulled back ~2.4% from $14.12 (Feb 16) to $13.78 (Feb 20), suggesting near-term selling pressure (-1-2%)
- Q4 EPS miss creates some lingering negative sentiment (-1%)
- No specific positive catalysts identified for the Feb 23-26 window (-1%)
- Stock is below its 52-week high of $14.50, but the recent pullback from $14.12 to $13.78 suggests resistance in the $14+ range (-1%)

**Net adjustment:** Roughly neutral to slightly positive. The fundamental picture is positive (Morningstar $16 target, strong guidance), but the very short timeframe and recent pullback temper enthusiasm.

**Net probability: approximately 52-54%**

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view is 54%. The inside view adjustments are modest and roughly cancel out. The recent pullback from $14.12 to $13.78 by Feb 20 is a mild negative signal for the very near term, but the fundamental backdrop (Morningstar $16 fair value, strong 2026 guidance) provides support. Given the 4-day window and inherent unpredictability of short-term stock movements, I'll set my inside view at **53%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria paraphrase:** Will Ford Motor (F) close higher on Feb 26, 2026 than its close on Feb 20, 2026? (4 trading days)

2. **Outside view base rate:** 54% (any stock rising over ~5 trading days, slightly adjusted for Ford's positive momentum context)

3. **Consistency check:** "53 out of 100 times, Ford's Feb 26 close exceeds its Feb 20 close." This is consistent with a near-coin-flip with slight positive tilt from fundamentals.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - Morningstar $16 fair value (expert, Feb 17) vs ~$13.78 current — suggests upside potential ✓
   - Ford pulled back from $14.12 (Feb 16) to $13.78 (Feb 20) — near-term selling pressure ✓
   - Strong 2026 EBIT guidance ($8-10B) already absorbed by market ✓
   - No specific catalysts identified for Feb 23-26 week ✓

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** A macro shock (tariff escalation, Fed hawkishness) or Ford-specific negative news (recall, EV write-down update) could push the stock down 3-5% in the week, making a "Yes" resolution very unlikely. This scenario would shift probability to ~40%.

6. **Status quo:** The stock has been in a mild pullback from its recent highs. If this continues, "No" becomes more likely. However, the broader trend remains positive.

Probability: 53%
