Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Yahoo Finance (F quote page, ~Feb 20, 2026):** Factual data source showing previous close of $13.78, day's range $13.72–$14.02, analyst consensus target of $13.97. High quality for price data. The "strong buy for value investors" commentary is editorial/opinion.

2. **TradingView (Feb 12, 2026):** Shows F at $13.98, neutral technical sentiment aggregate. Reliable for price data; anonymous trader commentary should be discounted. The technical "neutral" rating from aggregated indicators is factual but limited in predictive value.

3. **Macrotrends (Feb 19, 2026):** Latest close $13.78, 52-week high $14.50. Pure historical data, high reliability. Shows YTD 2026 gain of ~6.17%.

4. **Public.com (Feb 19, 2026):** Market cap data showing modest upward trend. Factual, reliable for trend context.

5. **TIKR.com (Feb 17, 2026):** Analysis article with model target of $17.38. Author Nikko Henson provides a structured valuation framework. The target is an opinion/model output, not a hard fact, but the underlying financial metrics cited are verifiable.

6. **CNBC (Feb 10, 2026):** Earnings report coverage. High-quality factual reporting on Q4 2025 results. Key facts: largest quarterly earnings miss in 4 years, but 2026 guidance of $8–$10B EBIT viewed positively.

7. **AOL Finance (Feb 11, 2026):** Reports F closed at $13.85 on Feb 11, up ~2.1% after earnings. Factual price data, reliable.

8. **Agent Report:** Synthesizes catalysts for the week of Feb 24–26. Identifies EV platform news, Novelis aluminum supply updates, macro data (PMI, PCE), options positioning, and analyst rating changes. Piper Sandler upgrade to Overweight with $16 target on Feb 8 is a notable factual claim. The historical 5-day return distribution was not computed due to data limitations.

9. **FRED S&P 500 data:** Shows S&P 500 at 6,861.89 on Feb 19, up ~11.7% YoY. Broad market context is positive but slightly softened recently (down from 6,978 peak).

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are applicable:

1. **Any 5-trading-day window for a single stock:** For any given stock over any 5-day period, the probability of closing higher is approximately 50–55%, reflecting a slight upward drift in equity markets.

2. **Ford specifically over 5-day windows:** Ford is a volatile stock (annualized vol ~25–30% implied by options data, ~14% mentioned in agent report — the 25% figure from options seems more realistic for a stock with this history). A weekly standard deviation of ~2–3% means the distribution is wide. Historical base rate for any stock rising over a week is roughly 52–55%.

3. **Ford in late February specifically:** The agent report couldn't compute this, but there's no strong seasonal pattern identified for Ford in late February specifically.

4. **Post-catalyst momentum:** Ford recently had positive earnings guidance (Feb 10–11), a Piper Sandler upgrade (Feb 8), and EV platform news (Feb 17). Post-catalyst momentum can persist for 1–2 weeks.

**Most suitable reference class:** The general "any 5-day window for a mid-cap/large-cap stock" reference class, adjusted for Ford-specific context. Base rate: ~52%.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- The question asks whether F's close on Feb 26 will be higher than its close on Feb 20.
- That's a 5-trading-day window (Feb 20 → Feb 26, with Feb 23, 24, 25, 26 being the trading days after Feb 20).
- The Feb 20 close appears to be approximately $13.97–$14.02 based on the Yahoo Finance data (day's range $13.72–$14.02, previous close $13.78, open $13.77). The question creation note says last close as of Feb 16 was $14.12, and the Yahoo Finance data shows Feb 20 trading with a range up to $14.02. The Feb 19 close was $13.78 per Macrotrends. The Feb 20 close is what we're comparing against — it appears to be somewhere around $13.78–$14.02.

- Over 5-day windows, individual stocks have roughly equal probability of rising or falling, with a slight upward drift.

**(d) Justification**

**Factors favoring Yes (price rises):**
- Positive momentum: Ford has been trending upward (up ~23% in 6 months, up ~6% YTD 2026)
- Strong 2026 guidance ($8–$10B EBIT) well-received by market
- Piper Sandler upgrade to Overweight with $16 target (Feb 8)
- EV platform announcement (Feb 17) — follow-through coverage expected in the week of Feb 24–26
- Analyst consensus target ($13.97) is roughly at current price, but individual targets go up to $16
- Dividend-reinvestment flows ahead of March 2 payment
- Broad market remains positive (S&P 500 near highs)
- Options data shows more call open interest at $14 than put OI at $13.50

**Factors favoring No (price falls or stays flat):**
- Stock is near 52-week high ($14.50), which may create resistance
- Analyst consensus target of $13.97 is slightly below current trading price (~$14), suggesting limited upside per consensus
- Novelis supply issues remain a headwind
- Macro risks: PCE data on Feb 26 could disappoint
- EPS was negative for full year 2025 (-$2.06 TTM)
- Broad market has softened slightly from its peak

**Net assessment:** The positive momentum, recent upgrades, and upcoming catalysts tilt the probability modestly above the 50% base rate. However, the stock is near resistance levels and the consensus target is at or slightly below current price. The 5-day window is short, and short-term stock movements are inherently unpredictable.

Outside view calibration:

- Base rate for any stock rising over 5 trading days: ~52%
- Adjustment for positive momentum and recent upgrades: +3–4%
- Adjustment for proximity to 52-week high and consensus target near/below current price: -2%
- Adjustment for positive macro environment: +1%
- Net: approximately 54–55%

The question is fundamentally about a short-term price movement, which is highly uncertain. The slight positive tilt from momentum and catalysts is real but modest. I'll set my outside view at approximately 54%.

Outside View Prediction:
54%
