Analysis:

7. **AskNews articles (various)**: Mostly irrelevant (Korean stocks, F-Secure, FS Bancorp, etc.). The Ford-specific articles are factual trading data. Low relevance for forward prediction except confirming price levels.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- Ford's Feb 20 close price is approximately $13.78 (down 0.51% on the day), below the question creation price of $14.12 and well below the 52-week high of $14.50. The stock has already pulled back from recent highs. This is factual and directly relevant.
- Morningstar fair value of $16 (identified expert, Feb 17, 2026) suggests upside from current ~$13.78 level, providing a mild bullish fundamental anchor. However, this is a long-term estimate, not a 4-day catalyst.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Ford's post-earnings reaction was positive (up 2.1% on Feb 11) despite the EPS miss, driven by strong 2026 guidance. This suggests the market has already digested the earnings news. No additional earnings catalyst expected before Feb 26.
- The stock is trading above its 200-day SMA ($12.13), indicating a medium-term uptrend. Moderate bullish signal.
- 2026 EBIT guidance of $8-10B is above 2025's $6.8B adjusted figure — a positive fundamental backdrop that was already priced in post-Feb 10 earnings.

**Weak evidence:**
- No specific catalysts (earnings, dividends, major product announcements) are scheduled between Feb 20-26.
- General macro environment: S&P 500 near ATH, broadly supportive but not specifically bullish for Ford.
- Ford's pivot to hybrids and cost-cutting narrative is positive but already known to the market.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window is 4 trading days (Feb 20 close → Feb 26 close). This is a very short horizon where:
- Random walk dominates: ~52% base rate for any positive 4-day return
- Ford's 4-day volatility (~4%) means the outcome is highly uncertain
- If halved to 2 days: probability would converge closer to 50% (less time for drift)
- If doubled to 8 days: slightly more time for fundamental drift, but still dominated by noise; probability might shift to ~55-56%

**(d) Justification**

Starting from the outside view base rate of 54.1%:

**Factors supporting upward adjustment:**
- Ford is trading at ~$13.78, which is below Morningstar's fair value of $16 and below the question creation price of $14.12. There's a mild reversion-to-mean argument. (+0.5 pp)
- The post-earnings sentiment was positive; the market looked past the EPS miss toward 2026 guidance. No new negative catalysts are apparent. (+0.5 pp)
- 200-day SMA is well below current price ($12.13 vs $13.78), confirming medium-term uptrend momentum. (+0.5 pp)

**Factors supporting downward adjustment:**
- Ford is already down 0.51% on Feb 20, suggesting some selling pressure. The stock has pulled back from $14.12 (question creation) to $13.78. (-0.5 pp)
- No specific positive catalyst scheduled for the next 4 trading days. Earnings already digested.
- The stock is near its 52-week high ($14.50), which may act as resistance. (-0.5 pp)
- Macro uncertainty (tariffs, PCE data on Feb 26) could create headwinds for auto stocks. (-0.5 pp)

Net adjustment: approximately +0.5 pp - 1.5 pp = -1 pp from outside view.

Calibrated inside view: 54.1% - 1.0% ≈ **53%**

**Probability Calibration**

The evidence is balanced with no strong directional catalyst. The base rate of ~52% for positive 4-day returns is the dominant factor. Small adjustments for:
- Mild positive fundamental backdrop (Morningstar FV > current price, post-earnings positive sentiment)
- Mild negative technical pressure (stock already declining on Feb 20, near 52-week high resistance)

These roughly cancel, leaving the prediction close to the outside view base rate of ~54%. I'll settle at **53%** to reflect the slight downward pressure from the Feb 20 decline and lack of positive catalysts.

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria**: Will Ford (F) close higher on Feb 26, 2026 than on Feb 20, 2026? 4 trading days. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate**: 54.1% (historical frequency of positive 4-day windows for Ford). My final prediction of 53% is rooted in this base rate with small adjustments. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "53 out of 100 times, Ford's Feb 26 close exceeds its Feb 20 close." This is consistent with a near-random-walk stock over 4 days with slight positive drift. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - Ford trading at $13.78 on Feb 20, down 0.51% (mild selling pressure, factual)
   - Morningstar FV $16 vs current ~$13.78 (fundamental upside, identified expert)
   - No earnings/major catalyst scheduled Feb 20-26 (neutral, factual)
   - Post-earnings positive sentiment already priced in (neutral-to-slightly-positive)
   - 52-week high at $14.50 acting as resistance (mild negative)
   All factual and verified. ✓

5. **Blind spot**: A major macro shock (tariff announcement, Fed surprise, geopolitical event) or Ford-specific news (recall, credit downgrade) could move the stock >4% in either direction, making the prediction look poorly calibrated. A negative macro shock would push probability below 50%.

6. **Status quo**: Ford has been in a mild uptrend since its April 2025 low ($8.44). The status quo (continuation of mild uptrend) slightly favors a higher close, consistent with ~53% probability.

Probability: 53%
