Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution criteria (<30 words)
Question resolves “Yes” if Ford (F) closes higher on 2026-02-26 than its close on 2026-02-20 (Yahoo Finance close prices; split-adjusted).

(a) Source analysis (brief, quality, date; fact vs opinion)
- AlphaQuery earnings history (2026-02-10 reported): High-level, credible factual recap of EPS estimate vs actual. Fact: Q4 2025 EPS miss ($0.13 vs $0.17 est).
- MarketChameleon page: Not usable (access error). No substantive data.
- Stockinsights.ai index: Mostly a filing/event index; low informational content for near-term price. Fact: lists dates/themes (pension remeasurement, EV strategy changes), but no detail.
- AOL/Finance “Ford stock rises after 2026 profit outlook” (2026-02-11): Credible financial news recap. Facts: price move/volume; 2026 EBIT guide $8–$10B; mentions 2025 loss drivers. Some interpretation about “investors looked past…” = opinion.
- Detroit News (2026-02-10): Reputable local business reporting. Facts: net loss driven by special charges; adjusted profit; 2026 guidance and industry outlook. Some framing about regulatory rollback benefits = analyst/reporting interpretation, plausible but not certain.
- Morningstar (2026-02-17, named analyst David Whiston): High quality. Facts: their fair value estimate ($16) and ratings (no moat, high uncertainty) are expert opinions; the cost/tariff/Novelis details appear research-based but still partly assumption-driven.
- AskNews/Stockpulse snippets (Feb 12–Feb 20): Mixed quality. The Ford-specific one (Feb 20) is near-real-time market/volume snapshot—useful but shallow; many other “F/FB/Fs” items are irrelevant tickers/noise. Treat Ford snippet’s price/volume as plausible facts, but not deep analysis.
- Outside-view block provided by you: Contains some references (Yahoo/TradingView/Macrotrends/CNBC etc.) but I can’t re-verify here; I treat it as a structured synthesis rather than an independent primary source.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (limited in this packet for a 4-trading-day move)
- None that cleanly “forces” direction over 4 trading days. No imminent Ford-specific scheduled catalyst in the Feb 23–26 window is provided here.

Moderate evidence
- Post-earnings / guidance regime: Multiple reputable sources (AOL, Detroit News, Morningstar) agree Ford guided 2026 adjusted EBIT $8–$10B and that the market reacted positively around Feb 10–12. Mechanism: improved forward profit narrative supports price, but much may already be priced in by Feb 20.
- Valuation anchor: Morningstar fair value $16 vs ~high-$13/low-$14 trading—expert opinion that suggests mild upside bias, but not tightly predictive at a 1-week horizon.
- Current tape/positioning proxy: The Feb 20 Stockpulse note indicates Ford was slightly down that day and roughly flat since end of last month—suggests no strong momentum tailwind right now.

Weak evidence
- EPS miss detail (AlphaQuery): Earnings surprise can matter, but the event is already in the past (Feb 10) and likely incorporated by Feb 20.
- Filing-index “themes” (Stockinsights): too non-specific for near-term direction.
- Irrelevant AskNews articles about other tickers: no evidentiary value.

Net: evidence is mildly supportive/neutral for “up,” but not strong; short-horizon noise and market beta likely dominate.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: from 2026-02-20 close to 2026-02-26 close is 6 calendar days, typically 4 U.S. trading sessions (Feb 23–26).
- If timeframe were halved (~2 trading days): probability should move closer to 50% (less time for drift), unless a specific catalyst existed.
- If timeframe were doubled (~8 trading days): probability would creep upward slightly if the supportive “guidance/valuation” narrative persists (more time for mild drift), but also more exposure to macro shocks.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside view baseline you established: 56% “Yes”.

Key pushes upward (relative to a pure coin flip):
- Supportive forward guidance narrative (2026 EBIT $8–$10B) was credibly reported and generally positive for sentiment (moderate +).
- Morningstar’s $16 fair value provides a mild “buy-the-dip” valuation backstop in the $13–$14 area (moderate +, but weak for 1-week prediction).

Key pushes downward / toward 50-50:
- Much of the guidance re-rating likely already occurred shortly after Feb 10; by Feb 20 the stock appears to be chopping/near recent highs, which often reduces near-term upside hit-rate (moderate –).
- Over a 4-session window, market-wide macro moves dominate idiosyncratic fundamentals; without a clear Ford-specific catalyst in-window, direction is close to random (moderate –).

Putting it together: the positive narrative is real but partially priced; absent a fresh catalyst, I’d shade the 56% down slightly toward ~55%.

Probability calibration
- Start: 56% (your outside view).
- Adjustment: -1 to -2 pts for “post-guidance digestion / near-term randomness dominates; no in-window Ford catalyst identified”.
- Small offset: +0 to +1 pt for valuation/supportive narrative still present.
Inside-view estimate: 55%.

Checklist:
1. Criteria check: “Yes” if F close on 2026-02-26 > F close on 2026-02-20 (Yahoo Finance close).
2. Outside view base rate: 56%.
3. Consistency line: 55 out of 100 times, F’s 2/26 close is higher than its 2/20 close.
4. Top evidence (3–5):
   - Ford guided 2026 adjusted EBIT $8–$10B; sentiment improved post-earnings (AOL/Detroit News/Morningstar).
   - Morningstar fair value $16 vs ~$14 area (expert valuation opinion).
   - No clear new Ford-specific catalyst identified for Feb 23–26; short-horizon moves are noisy.
   - Stock appears near recent highs/flat-ish near-term, reducing momentum edge.
5. Blind spot (most likely to look silly): A macro shock (e.g., hot inflation/PCE-style risk-off) or sudden auto/tariff headline could dominate and swing F sharply down (or up), overwhelming base rates.
6. Status quo outcome: With no fresh catalyst, “slightly-above-coinflip” is the status quo for a 4-trading-day horizon; avoid over-updating.

Probability: 55%
