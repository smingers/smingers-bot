**Forecasting stock movement**

I need to estimate a forecast for a stock, and I'm looking at the closing date of February 26, with today being the 20th. I’m using sources I have, noting a 56% external estimate. I see there’s been a recent earnings miss, but the guidance remains strong, suggesting some upside. The stock’s currently priced between 13.78 and 14.12. There’s a big macro event happening on February 26 that might affect the market, so I need to analyze these components closely.**Analyzing evidence and probabilities**

I’m analyzing evidence with regards to a timeframe of 6 calendar days and 4 trading days. I need to consider factors like halving or doubling when weighing my analysis. I’ll start with a base probability of 56% and make adjustments based on earnings guidance already priced in, proximity to resistance, and macro data risks, which might bring it down a bit. There’s also potential upward influence from Morningstar's fair value and liquidity, so a final estimate might be around 55%. Let's put together a response!
