**Crafting a forecast**

I need to create a detailed analysis while applying a Good Judgment style for forecasting. Starting from an outside view baseline of 52.7%, I'll adjust it with inside view factors. Right now, Ford is trading around 13.78, but I might estimate the close at 13.8. I want to examine what the probability is that the price will rise above this level by February 26, considering momentum, macro environment factors, and potential upcoming economic data releases that could influence the auto sector.**Analyzing probability adjustments**

I’m looking at the auto sector as cyclical and noting the shift to EVs, although nothing significant is coming up soon. The UAW contract is still far off, and the dividend ex-date passed on February 13, so no capturing flows there. The recent option expiration may influence gamma neutrality. Given that the stock is slightly below 14, I lean toward adjusting the probability of it going up to 53%, considering momentum and market drift. I think finalizing it at 53% would be a reasonable approach, despite some resistance.
