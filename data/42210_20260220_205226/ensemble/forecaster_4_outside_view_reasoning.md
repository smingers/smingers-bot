**Estimating Ford's Price Probability**

I need to assess the probability that Ford's closing price on February 26 will be higher than its close on February 20. Today is February 20, and the US market closes at 21:00 UTC. I’ll assume the closing price today will be known later, but the last closing price from February 19 was 13.78, with an intraday price around 14.12. I’ll estimate the probability of a positive return over the next four trading days, considering historical patterns and expected drift.**Crafting Ford's Analysis**

There's been an upward trend year-to-date that we can factor in. I think we can adjust the probability to around 55%. To analyze this, I'll summarize various sources, including Ford's 4-day returns, S&P constituents, and large-cap auto trends. Setting the base probability at 52%, I’ll consider how S&P macros are trending near a 52-week high, indicating some risk of mean reversion. A good estimate seems to be around 53%, so I'll aim to create a thorough analysis.
