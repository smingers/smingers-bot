Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Stockpulse headline “Ford Motor (F) trading –0.51 % lower on 20 Feb 2026” – real-time quote feed (07:23 CET, i.e. pre-market U.S.). High factual quality for last indicated price/volume; no opinion.  
2. AOL Finance 11 Feb piece – identifies 2026 guidance, quotes management; reputable but one week old. Factual numbers (price move, volumes, EBIT guide) are reliable, forward-looking optimism is corporate opinion → moderate weight.  
3. Detroit News 10 Feb earnings article – mainstream newspaper, good for hard figures (2025 loss, 2026 EBIT guidance). Opinions limited to CEO remarks → moderate.  
4. Morningstar 17 Feb analyst note – named CFA; methodology disclosed; strong single-source evidence on valuation, risk and lack of moat → moderate to strong.  
5. AlphaQuery earnings history – database of past surprises; purely factual, very high reliability.  
6. Misc. AskNews items (Creas F&c, FFIV, etc.) are about tickers whose symbol only starts with “F” and are irrelevant – ignored.  

(b) Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong:  
• No ex-dividend date or scheduled company catalyst before 26 Feb → structural status quo.  
Moderate:  
• Positive 2026 EBIT guidance cited by multiple outlets; price reacted +2 % and has stayed above 50-/200-day MAs (momentum).  
• Broad market trend still up; S&P 500 within 2 % of ATH; high-β stocks often track index over such a short horizon.  
Weak:  
• Ford now only 5 % below 52-week high → some mean-reversion risk.  
• Minor option-expiration volatility on 20 Feb could leave a post-expiration drift lower (empirical but weak).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = four U.S. trading days (Mon 24 Feb – Thu 26 Feb).  
If horizon were halved to 2 days there would be less time for drift, probability would move ~1 pp toward 50 %.  
If it were doubled to 8 days the variance rises; the historical positive-close frequency for Ford over 8 days is ~54 %, so probability would creep ~1–2 pp higher.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (4-day Ford windows, 2016-25) = 53.2 %.  
Down-adjust 2 pp for proximity to 52-week high/possible mean reversion.  
Up-adjust 1 pp for continuing bullish macro momentum (index near ATH, no obvious risk events).  
Net inside-view probability ≈ 52 %.  

Checklist:  
1. “Will Ford’s closing price on Thu 26 Feb 2026 be higher than its Fri 20 Feb 2026 close?” (4 trading-day window).  
2. Outside view 53.2 % positive 4-day moves.  
3. “Roughly 52 out of 100 times Ford will finish higher after four sessions.” — consistent.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • Historical 4-day win-rate 53 %.  
   • No company/sector catalyst before 26 Feb.  
   • Broad-market momentum still positive.  
   • Stock sits <5 % from 52-week high (mean-reversion risk).  
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected macro shock (e.g., hot PCE inflation) triggers 3 %+ market drop; would slash probability to <40 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: Absent news, drift is slightly up; nudges forecast toward (>50 %) outcome.  

Probability calibration
Given the modest push–pull between upward momentum and proximity to resistance, I set the probability at slightly above even chance.

Probability: 52%
