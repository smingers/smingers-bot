**Forecasting stock probabilities**

I need to produce a forecast probability for Ford stock closing on February 26, 2026, higher than today's close on February 20, 2026. The outside view gives us 52.7%. Now, I'll incorporate more recent information and analyze various factors like source analysis and evidence weighting. For today's closing price, it seems the premarket price was 13.78. However, the last close on February 16 was 14.12, and I’ll need to anticipate the closing price later today for better forecasting.**Considering stock catalysts**

I need to consider the catalysts affecting Ford stock between February 21-26 during four trading sessions. There's nothing major like earnings but there could be macro events, like the January PCE data on February 25. I'll incorporate momentum and sentiment, especially since the price is near a 52-week high of 14.5. 

Today’s close might be around 13.80-13.90, with the outside view at 53%. Positive trends show the stock up from 13.12 to 14.12 recently, but there's some consolidation. There’s no upcoming ex-dividend drop, and it seems there might be an investor day on February 25, but I’ll confirm that.**Assessing Catalysts for Probability**

I'm considering the macro catalyst of the PCE inflation data potentially releasing on February 26, which typically happens near the end of the month. Historically, it's not a huge mover for rates and I'm keeping expectations realistic. 

Since the stock is near its 52-week high of 14.5, I should adjust down my inside view probability from 53% to around 51%, factoring in potential mean reversion and the recent positive trend. Today’s price is about 13.9, so I'll finalize my analysis with these insights.
