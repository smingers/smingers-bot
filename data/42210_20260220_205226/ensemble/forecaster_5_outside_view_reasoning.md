**Evaluating analysis requirements**

I need to write an analysis that includes summarizing information sources and evaluating their quality and dates while differentiating between facts and opinions. I’ll pick a reference class, like daily returns for Ford over a one-week timeframe. The timeframe involves looking six calendar days ahead from February 20, 2026. I realize February 20 is indeed a Friday, meaning I’ll assess the price difference across four trading days, considering the weekend. I'll also need to establish a baseline probability for price changes by Thursday.**Crafting baseline analysis**

I'm aiming to approximate the probability of Ford's stock increasing over four trading days, estimating it around 52% due to a slight upward drift. To do this, I'll analyze historical returns from 2014 to 2025 and compute how often there's a positive four-day return. I can use daily return data to refine my estimates, considering factors like the recent dividend date and stock position, but my outside view will rely heavily on historical data. Adjustments for the day-of-week effect and the S&P drift may also influence my final probability, which I believe could land around 53%. I need to summarize my findings but keep them concise and clear.
