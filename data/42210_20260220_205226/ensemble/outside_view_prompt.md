</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide key catalysts for Ford (F) over next week; include scheduled events, analyst rating changes since 2026-02-01, and historical 5-day return distribution for late-February weeks past 10 yrs.
Below is an integrated view of the three items the requester specified—(1) near-term catalysts for Ford Motor Co. (ticker F) during the trading week Monday 24 February through Thursday 26 February 2026, (2) every analyst rating/target-price change that could be documented with a public timestamp on or after 1 February 2026, and (3) what is known—and still missing—about Ford’s five-trading-day return behaviour in late-February weeks over the last ten years.

1. Scheduled or otherwise visible catalysts for 24–26 February 2026

a. EV-platform follow-through  
   • On 17 February Ford livestreamed “The Next Chapter in Ford’s EV Journey,” introducing its so-called Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) architecture.  Management claimed a 40 % reduction in manufacturing steps and a 20 % parts-count cut versus existing EV platforms.  The webcast ended after the 20 February close, so updated brokerage models, technical-spec press coverage and supplier confirmation are expected to reach the market throughout the week beginning 24 February. (EVinfo.net summary cited in previous round; no contradiction in new sources.)

b. Aluminium-supply commentary  
   • Morningstar’s post-earnings note of 17 February re-emphasised that lost F-Series output tied to Novelis’ fire-damaged aluminium plant shaved roughly $2 bn from 2025 EBIT and is expected to take another $1 bn from 2026 EBIT until the plant resumes normal output “between May and September.”  Any news-wire update on Novelis repairs or Ford’s alternative sourcing could move the stock intra-week. (Morningstar, 17 Feb 2026)

c. Macro data that disproportionately affect auto OEMs  
   • Tuesday 24 Feb – S&P Global flash U.S. Manufacturing PMI (sensitive to auto supply-chain sentiment)  
   • Thursday 26 Feb – U.S. Personal-Income/PCE inflation release (rate-expectation input; Ford is rate-sensitive via auto-credit volumes)  
   While not Ford-specific, both data points have historically produced higher-than-average one-day moves in “durables” shares, Ford included.  No other company-specific events appear on Ford’s official “News & Events” page as of 20 Feb 2026.

d. Options-market positioning into the 27 Feb weekly expiry  
   • Open-interest skews show 6,800+ contracts in the $14.00 calls and 3,200+ in the $13.50 puts expiring 27 Feb, with at-the-money IV ~25 – 26 %.  Spot at $13.97 puts the stock in a high-gamma zone; dealer hedging can amplify underlying share moves mid-week. (Yahoo Finance options snapshot, 20 Feb 2026)

e. Dividend-reinvestment flows  
   • Q1 regular dividend ($0.15) goes payable on 2 March.  Long-only dividend-reinvestment programs typically accumulate stock in the five trading days preceding payment, occasionally providing a liquidity tail-wind.

2. Analyst-rating and target-price changes dated 1 Feb 2026 or later

The public-domain record lists three discrete, timestamped actions plus a composite update:

• 8 Feb 2026 – Piper Sandler upgraded Ford to Overweight from Neutral and lifted its 12-month price target to $16 from $11, citing improved autonomy-software roadmap and aggressive cost discipline.  Same-day share-price response: +4.8 %.  (Yahoo Finance/Motley Fool, 8 Feb 2026)

• 10 Feb 2026 – Ford’s Q4 earnings release led several brokers to refresh models; Morningstar reiterated its $16 fair-value estimate on 17 Feb (Morningstar, 17 Feb 2026).  Although Morningstar is not a sell-side trading desk, its star-rating system is widely referenced by retail platforms and can influence order flow.

• 17 Feb 2026 – Benzinga automated “Analyst Ratings” digest showed the average 12-month Street target moving up to $13.88 from $11.73.  The digest aggregates desk notes issued between 1 Feb and 17 Feb, implying multiple upward target revisions even if individual broker names were not enumerated.  (Benzinga digest, accessed 19 Feb 2026)

• No downgrades or negative target revisions post-1 Feb were located in any available feed (Yahoo Finance, Benzinga, Morningstar, Globe & Mail, TIKR.com).  Net sentiment for the measurement window is therefore positive: one explicit upgrade and several price-target increases, with zero observable downgrades.

3. Historical five-day (Monday-through-Friday) return distribution for late-February weeks, 2016-2025

Requirement: compute the percentage change from Monday close to Friday close for each week whose Friday fell between 20 Feb and 28 Feb over the last ten calendar years, then summarise the distribution (mean, median, standard deviation, up/down count).

Status of available data: none of the supplied sources include daily close series prior to February 2026.  Without those closes the distribution cannot be calculated.  That data can be pulled in one line via the yfinance API—e.g.,

   import yfinance as yf;  
   f = yf.Ticker("F");  
   hist = f.history(start="2016-02-15", end="2026-02-28");

but the underlying price points are still required.  Until historical closes for the weeks ending:

• 26 Feb 2016  
• 24 Feb 2017  
• 23 Feb 2018  
• 22 Feb 2019  
• 28 Feb 2020  
• 26 Feb 2021  
• 25 Feb 2022  
• 24 Feb 2023  
• 23 Feb 2024  
• 21 Feb 2025

are fetched, the late-February return distribution remains an information gap.

Preliminary qualitative context (drawn from Morningstar volatility data and Ford’s one-year price statistics in Yahoo Finance) suggests a typical weekly one-standard-deviation move of roughly ±4 % (calculated from a 14 % annualised vol on a $11–$14 base price), but that is not a substitute for the requested empirical distribution.

Information still needed
• Daily closing prices for Ford for the exact trading days making up the late-February weeks 2016-2025, in order to compute the five-day return series and its descriptive statistics.  
• Identification of any additional post-1 Feb 2026 broker rating changes not captured in the Benzinga digest; full sell-side coverage lists (e.g., from Bloomberg or FactSet) would confirm whether any downgrades occurred but were missed by free sources.

Once those two data sets are secured, all elements of the original query can be fully satisfied.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
