Management claimed a 40 % reduction in manufacturing steps and a 20 % parts-count cut versus existing EV platforms.

Analyst-rating and target-price changes dated 1 Feb 2026 or later\n\nThe public-domain record lists three discrete, timestamped actions plus a composite update:\n\n\u2022 8 Feb 2026 \u2013 Piper Sandler upgraded Ford to Overweight from Neutral and lifted its 12-month price target to $16 from $11, citing improved autonomy-software roadmap and aggressive cost discipline.  Same-day share-price response: +4.8 %.  (Yahoo Finance/Motley Fool, 8 Feb 2026)\n\n\u2022 10 Feb 2026 \u2013 Ford\u2019s Q4 earnings release led several brokers to refresh models; Morningstar reiterated its $16 fair-value estimate on 17 Feb (Morningstar, 17 Feb 2026).  Although Morningstar is not a sell-side trading desk, its star-rating system is widely referenced by retail platforms and can influence order flow.\n\n\u2022 17 Feb 2026 \u2013 Benzinga automated \u201cAnalyst Ratings\u201d digest showed the average 12-month Street target moving up to $13.88 from $11.73.  The digest aggregates desk notes issued between 1 Feb and 17 Feb, implying multiple upward target revisions even if individual broker names were not enumerated.  (Benzinga digest, accessed 19 Feb 2026)\n\n\u2022 No downgrades or negative target revisions post-1 Feb were located in any available feed (Yahoo Finance, Benzinga, Morningstar, Globe & Mail, TIKR.com).  Net sentiment for the measurement window is therefore positive: one explicit upgrade and several price-target increases, with zero observable downgrades.\n\n3. Historical five-day (Monday-through-Friday) return distribution for late-February weeks, 2016-2025\n\nRequirement: compute the percentage change from Monday close to Friday close for each week whose Friday fell between 20 Feb and 28 Feb over the last ten calendar years, then summarise the distribution (mean, median, standard deviation, up/down count).\n\nStatus of available data: none of the supplied sources include daily close series prior to February 2026.
