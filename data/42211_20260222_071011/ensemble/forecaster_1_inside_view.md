**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **HAL-specific 5-day historical base rate (51.8%)**: Directly computed from actual price data, 2,510 windows. This is the most reliable quantitative anchor. No large shift warranted without strong countervailing factors.
- **Stock near 52-week high ($35.11 vs. high $35.85)**: Multiple sources confirm this. Technical resistance at highs is a well-documented phenomenon. Moderate downward pressure.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Analyst consensus targets above current price** ($35.19-$36.34 average, with several at $38-40): Multiple named institutions (Goldman $40, BMO $39, Argus $39, RBC $38). Suggests modest upside potential. However, consensus targets are often lagging indicators and the average is only slightly above current price.
- **Weak Q1 2026 guidance**: Management guided sequential revenue and margin declines. Named source (Zacks, Finviz). This is a near-term headwind already partially known.
- **Significant insider selling**: CEO sold 171,200 shares at ~$34.96, EVP sold 100,000 shares. Total 337,002 shares in 90 days. This is a bearish signal from insiders who know the company best.
- **Oil price environment**: WTI ~$62-63, down 12% YoY. Bearish for oilfield services. However, 1-month change is +5.3%, providing some near-term support.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Zacks Hold rating / "fully priced" characterization**: Opinion from identifiable source, but Zacks ratings have limited short-term predictive power over 5 days.
- **Morningstar fair value $27**: Significant discount to current price, but Morningstar's DCF-based valuations often diverge from market prices for extended periods.
- **Recent momentum**: 1-month return +5.25%, 3-month return +31.89% — strong recent momentum could continue or mean-revert.
- **Ex-dividend date March 4**: Just after resolution window, so no dividend-related price drop within the window. Slightly positive.
- **Macro oil surplus**: 3.8 Mbbl/day surplus forecast is a structural headwind but operates over longer timeframes than 5 days.

**Net evidence assessment**: The evidence is roughly balanced, with slight lean toward downside due to: (1) proximity to 52-week high creating resistance, (2) insider selling, (3) weak Q1 guidance, (4) bearish oil macro. However, analyst targets above current price and recent strong momentum provide offsetting support. The net adjustment from 51.8% is small.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**5 trading days** (Feb 22 to Feb 28, 2026). This is an extremely short window where:
- Random walk dynamics dominate; fundamental factors have minimal incremental predictive power
- The historical base rate (51.8%) reflects essentially a coin flip
- 30-day realized volatility of 33.6% annualized implies ~2.1% daily vol, or ~4.7% over 5 days (1 sigma)
- Any known information (Q1 guidance, oil prices, analyst targets) is largely priced in

**If halved (2-3 days)**: Even closer to 50/50; random noise dominates even more. Prediction would be ~50%.

**If doubled (10 trading days)**: Fundamental factors (weak Q1 guidance, oil macro) would have more time to manifest. Prediction would shift slightly more toward 48-49% (more weight on bearish fundamentals).

The 5-day window strongly anchors us near the base rate.

**(d) Justification**

Starting from the 51.8% base rate:

**Downward adjustments:**
- Proximity to 52-week high (technical resistance): -1.0%
- Insider selling (CEO, EVP sold large blocks near current price): -0.8%
- Weak Q1 2026 guidance (sequential declines): -0.5%
- Bearish oil macro (WTI -12% YoY, global surplus): -0.5%
- "Fully priced" characterization by Zacks after 65% rally: -0.3%

**Upward adjustments:**
- Analyst targets above current price ($35.19-$40 range): +0.5%
- Recent strong momentum (1-month +5.25%, 3-month +31.89%): +0.3%
- Ex-dividend date after resolution window (no price drop): +0.2%
- Moderate Buy consensus from multiple named institutions: +0.2%

**Net adjustment: -1.9%**, yielding approximately **49.9%**, which I'll round to **50%**.

The key insight is that over a 5-day window, the market has already priced in most known information. The fundamental headwinds (Q1 guidance, oil macro) are known and partially reflected in the current price. The stock's proximity to its 52-week high and insider selling are the most meaningful bearish signals, but they're not strong enough to warrant a large deviation from the base rate.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view gives 51.8% (HAL-specific 5-day base rate). The inside view adjustments are modest and net slightly negative, yielding ~50%. Given the essentially coin-flip nature of short-term stock movements and the slight lean of evidence toward downside, I'll set my final probability at **50%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria**: Will HAL's close price on Feb 28, 2026 exceed its close price on Feb 22, 2026? 5 trading days. ✓ Aligned.

2. **Base rate**: 51.8% (HAL-specific 5-day positive return, 2,510 windows). Final prediction ~50% is rooted to this. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "50 out of 100 times, HAL's Feb 28 close exceeds its Feb 22 close." This makes sense — it's essentially a coin flip with slight lean toward downside given current conditions. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - HAL-specific 5-day base rate: 51.8% positive (strong, factual) ✓
   - Stock near 52-week high ($35.11 vs. $35.85 high): technical resistance (moderate, factual) ✓
   - CEO sold 171,200 shares at ~$34.96 (insider selling signal) (moderate, factual) ✓
   - Analyst consensus targets $34.95-$36.34 (slight upside) (moderate, named sources) ✓
   - Q1 2026 guidance: sequential revenue/margin declines (moderate, management guidance) ✓

5. **Blind spot**: A positive oil price catalyst (e.g., OPEC+ production cut announcement, geopolitical supply disruption) could push HAL up 5%+ in a week, making a "Yes" resolution much more likely. This could shift probability to 60%+. Conversely, a sharp oil price drop or broader market selloff could push it to 40%.

6. **Status quo**: The stock closed at $35.11 on Feb 22. The status quo (no change) would resolve "No." Given the coin-flip nature, slight nudge toward status quo (no change = No) is appropriate, supporting ~50%.

Probability: 50%
