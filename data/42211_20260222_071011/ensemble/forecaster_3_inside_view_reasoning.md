**Forecasting HAL's Probability**

I need to forecast the probability that HAL's close on February 28 will exceed the February 22 close of $35.11. Today is February 22, with a horizon of 5 trading days. I have an outside view of 49.5%. The inside view can be adjusted based on recent news showing raised price targets, a strong stock momentum, and nearing a 52-week high. I might nudge my estimate slightly upward to about 51% due to positive analyst sentiment, but I'll consider mean reversion as a counterbalance. I'll ensure to provide a structured analysis as well.
