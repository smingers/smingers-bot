**Considering outside view for predictions**

I need to focus on the outside view for generating predictions, as the user is analyzing this. The base rate is 51.8%, and I think we should mostly anchor on this while making slight adjustments based on context. It's important to integrate relevant factors without leaning too much into the inside view. The timeframe from 2/22 to 2/28 includes 5 trading days, so it makes sense to consider the base rate directly influenced by them.**Analyzing base rate and probabilities**

I’ve set the base rate at 51.8%, but maybe adjusting it to 51.6% could represent some uncertainty. Equities typically have a slight upward drift, making 52% seem reasonable. I need to gather data sources from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and others. Focusing on HAL’s 5-day returns is essential, as it provides relevant context. The timeframe from 2/22 to 2/28 has about 5 trading days, so I need to evaluate the standard deviation and remember the impact of elevated volatility on the base rate.**Evaluating probability adjustments**

Volatility doesn't change the sign of probabilities, but it might increase tails. For a symmetric distribution, this is important to note. Since the current price is near a 52-week high, I might want a slight downward adjustment for mean reversion, but I'll focus on the outside view. A small upward drift from the equity risk premium could push it above 50%. So, I’ll decide on a final probability of around 51.6% to ensure it’s not a multiple of 5.
