**Finalizing probability estimates**

I’m thinking I could raise the probability from 51.3% to around 53-54%. But I have to keep the historical base in mind. I think I’ll settle on 53%. Next, I need to make sure to include solid evidence to back up my classification. So, I’ll start crafting the final answer carefully to ensure it’s well supported!
