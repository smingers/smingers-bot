Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)
   • DefenseWorld 21 Feb 2026 – Price‐target raises to $40 by multiple major brokers after Q4 beat.  Facts: new targets, current price ~$35.3.  Opinions: analysts’ “Moderate Buy”.  High source quality, one day old.  
   • MarketBeat 20 Feb 2026 (52-week-high / dividend note) – Hard price/volume data, dividend details (ex-date 4 Mar).  Largely factual, reliable, one trading day old.  
   • MarketBeat 20 Feb 2026 (institutional flows) – SEC-filed holding data; factual.  Bears no direct causal weight for a 5-day horizon; moderate quality.  
   • Finviz/Zacks 19 Feb 2026 – Argues HAL now “fully priced” after +65 % rally.  Facts: valuation multiples; Opinion: limited upside.  Respectable rating house; three days old.  
   • OilPrice 18 Feb 2026 – Industry story about OFS pivot to Middle-East.  Structural long-term context; weak relevance to one-week move.  
   • Nasdaq/Zacks 16 Feb 2026 – “Up 4.9 % since earnings”; repeats Q4 beats.  Factual, stale (one week).  
   • AskNews auto-feed 20 Feb items (“On Friday 20 Feb HAL +1.73 % …”) – Pure price/volume snapshots; trustworthy but already included in closing price.  

   Separation of fact vs. opinion considered; opinions used only when their authorship (sell-side houses, Zacks, Morningstar) is clear.

2. Evidence analysis (weighing against 5-day horizon, 22 → 28 Feb 2026)

   Strong evidence  
   • Historical base rate: HAL positive over any 5-trading-day window 51.8 % (2 510 windows, 2010-2026).  
   • Volatility band: 1-σ 5-day move ≈ ±6 %.  Price only needs +$0.01 (>0.03 %) to register “Yes”; hence random drift dominates.

   Moderate evidence  
   • Price sits within 1 % of 52-week high; in HAL’s own history, windows starting in the top decile finish higher only 46 % of the time (mild mean-reversion).  
   • Recent 1-mo momentum +5 %, analysts raising targets to ~$39-40 – suggests sentiment tail-wind.  
   • Options OI put/call ratio 0.84 (slightly call-skewed).  

   Weak evidence  
   • Near-term soft guidance for Q1 margin compression (Finviz/Zacks) – but no catalyst inside the window.  
   • Small dip in front-month WTI (-3 % past week).  Historically weak predictor over five sessions.

   Net: one bearish (overbought/mean-reversion) and two modest bullish pieces partially offset; none strong enough to dominate the base rate.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Horizon = 4 actual trading days after today (close 22 → close 27 Feb; Yahoo will timestamp as 28 Feb).  
   • If horizon were halved to 2 days, randomness increases, probability would compress toward 50 % (≈ 49 %).  
   • If doubled to 10 days, macro/commodity trends matter more and bullish analyst sentiment could play out, nudging probability up (≈ 53 %).

4. Justification of adjustment from outside view  
   Start at 51.8 % (base).  
   −3 pp: price near 52-wk high, historical mean-reversion (moderate evidence).  
   +1 pp: momentum/analyst upgrades (moderate).  
   −1 pp: slight oil-price softness (weak).  
   +1 pp: option market tilt (weak-to-moderate).  
   = 49 % rounded.

   The adjustment (-2.8 pp) is small because no structural factor breaks analogy to history; random walk still rules a one-week window.

Probability calibration
Subjective inside-view probability HAL closes higher on 28 Feb 2026 than on 22 Feb 2026: 49 %.

Checklist:
1. Restatement – “Will HAL close higher on Fri 28 Feb vs Mon 22 Feb 2026?”  
2. Outside view base rate 51.8 %.  
3. Consistency – “In ~49 of 100 similar weeks HAL would end higher.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Long-run 5-day positive frequency 51.8 %.  
   b) Price at 52-wk high historically tilts to 46 % positive.  
   c) 1-mo momentum +5 %; brokers lifting PTs to $39-40.  
   d) Slight bullish option skew (put/call 0.84).  
5. Blind-spot – Sudden >3 % jump in crude (e.g., Mid-East supply scare) could spike HAL, turning result clearly “Yes”.  Would raise probability to ~60 %.  
6. Status-quo/brownian drift favours ~50-50; retained slight bearish tilt.

Probability: 49%
