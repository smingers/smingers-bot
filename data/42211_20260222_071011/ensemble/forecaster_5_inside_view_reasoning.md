**Crafting the forecast**

I need to create the forecast, considering an outside view probability of 48.8%. But I also need to gather insights from the inside view. So first, I’ll summarize relevant analyses, weighting the evidence to align with the timeframe of the next four trading days, using February 22 as our reference close. For now, midday prices are around 35.11, and there don’t seem to be significant events until March 4. I’ll keep in mind that oil prices might trend down while still being stable, along with technical momentum indicating potential new highs.**Analyzing the inside view**

I’m looking into the inside view, where the starting price for the February 22 close is unknown. However, I can approximate it at the midday price of 35.11, assuming it might end the day around there. If oil remains stable, we have some momentum, but being close to the 52-week high suggests a mean reversion might decrease our probability. I’ll factor in weekend risks and conclude with a probability of about 49%. Since we already have 48.8%, maybe I’ll revise it slightly to 49%. Now, it’s time to craft the answer and a checklist.
