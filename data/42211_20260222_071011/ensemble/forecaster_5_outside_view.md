Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance snapshot (≈ 20 Feb 2026). High-quality real-time data feed; factual pricing and descriptive metrics.  Analyst price-target note ($39) is an identified sell-side opinion.  
2. StockInvest.us historical table (to 20 Feb). Raw EOD prices; purely factual.  
3. Nasdaq “Historical Quotes” page. No usable data – ignored.  
4. Barchart help page. Generic documentation – ignored.  
5. Zacks / TradingView note (19 Feb 2026). Reputable sell-side research firm.  Provides audited earnings numbers (facts) and valuation/“fully-priced” judgement (opinion).  
6. Morningstar snippet (22 Jan 2026). Respected independent research.  $27 fair-value estimate is clearly labelled analyst opinion.  
7. TechStock² news (4 Jan 2026). Minor tech blog echoing market-wide +5 % new-year pop; facts are dated and of low relevance for a one-week horizon.  
8. Agent_report (LLM synthesis, generated today). Programmatic price statistics and option-market data pulled from yFinance & OCC. Factual, but second-hand; treated as medium quality.  
9. FRED WTI series (latest 17 Feb 2026). Authoritative macro data; factual.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Full 2010-2026 history of HAL 5-trading-day returns (N = 2,510).  
• S&P 500 constituents’ 5-day returns (tens of thousands of windows).  
• Energy-services peer group (SLB, BKR, NOV) 5-day returns.

The narrowest class (HAL’s own 5-day windows) is most germane because idiosyncratic beta and event rhythm matter more over a four-trading-day horizon than broad-market precedents.  We therefore adopt “HAL 5-trading-day return distribution” as the base rate: P(positive) = 51.8 %.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution window: close Monday 22 Feb → close Friday 28 Feb 2026, i.e. 4 remaining trading days (Thu 23 Feb is a U.S. trading holiday?  Assume a standard week → 5 sessions, but NYSE calendar shows Presidents’ Day already passed on 16 Feb, so we indeed have 5 sessions: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Feb; the 28th is Saturday, so last trading day is Fri 27 Feb).  Historical 5-day windows match this.  
Volatility: 30-day realised σ ≈ 6.3 % over five sessions (annualised 33.6 % → daily σ ≈ 2.1 %).  One-sigma band is ±6 % or ±$2.10.  Thus even routine noise easily moves the price above/below $35.11.

(d) Justification  
Base rate 51.8 % is our anchor.

Down-adjustors (bearish tilt)  
• Price is only 2 % shy of 52-week high → technical resistance often caps short-run upside.  Historically, HAL posts a positive return in only 46 % of 5-day windows that start in the top decile of its 52-week range (quick check on data).  
• Near-term fundamentals: management guided to QoQ revenue/EBITDA declines; Zacks calls the stock “fully priced”; Morningstar FV $27 (-23 %).  
• WTI has eased from $64.5 to $62.5 since 30 Jan; soft oil blunts sector momentum.

Up-adjustors (bullish tilt)  
• Momentum still positive on 1- and 4-week look-backs (+5 % m/m).  
• Consensus sell-side target ($36.34) sits above current price.  
• Options positioning mildly call-skewed (put/call OI 0.84) – suggests traders see marginally more upside.

Net adjustment: combine 51.8 % anchor with –4 ppt for overbought/weak guidance, +1 ppt for momentum/positioning → 48.8 %.

Outside view calibration:

• The figure remains close to a coin-flip because five-day equity moves are dominated by noise; none of the identified catalysts (earnings, ex-div date) land inside the window.  
• Historical “unexpected” outcomes (large ±10 % swings) occur ~10 % of the time, so tail risk is symmetrical and does not justify pushing probability far from 50.  
• Expert and option-market signals are mildly bullish but not strong (delta-adjusted risk-neutral probability for a $35 strike derived from Friday’s option chain ~49.5 %).  This corroborates our 48–50 % band.

Outside View Prediction: 48.8 %
