**Evaluating predictions**

I need to craft an answer focusing on outside view predictions, which use historical base rates. We're looking at a 5-day window, considering the trading days from the 22nd to the 28th. 

For my analysis, I'll evaluate various sources: 

1. Yahoo Finance has factual data and some analyst opinions. 
2. StockInvest.us has factual information. 
3. Nasdaq is not useful. 
4. Barchart is irrelevant. 
5. TradingView provides reputable analysis. 
6. Morningstar offers fair value opinions. 
7. TechStock² has factual details. 
8. An aggregator gives summarized data. 
9. FREDData is factual as well. 

I’ll note that I expect about a 52% positive probability for the timeframe.**Adjusting predictions**

I’m considering adjusting my prediction downward due to factors like technical overbought conditions, weak guidance, and macro headwinds. However, the outside view can remain anchored to a base rate of around 51.8%. 

I might integrate the S&P 500's 5-day base rate into this. So for my outside view prediction, I’m thinking perhaps 49%, but I really want to be precise and not just round to 5%. I think settling on a probability of 48% could work, and I need to clearly justify that choice.
