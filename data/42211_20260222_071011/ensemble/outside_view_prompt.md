## Summary: "Why Halliburton Looks Fully Priced After a 65% Run in 6 Months" (TradingView/Zacks, February 19, 2026)

**Source reliability note:** This article originates from Zacks Investment Research, a financial analysis firm with a defined rating methodology. Opinions reflect Zacks' analytical framework and should be considered accordingly.

### Key Facts & Statistics
- HAL shares rallied ~65% over the prior six months, reaching a 52-week high of **$35.55** in late January 2026
- HAL trades at ~**15x forward earnings**, well below the Oil & Gas Field Services industry average of **>21x**
- Over the same six-month period: **SLB up ~55%**, **Baker Hughes up ~44%**
- 2026 EPS consensus estimate rose ~4% over 30 days (from $2.18 → **$2.26**); 2027 estimates also up ~4% to **$2.65**
- Q4 revenues: **$5.7 billion**; adjusted EPS: **$0.69**; operating cash flow: **$1.2 billion**
- Full-year 2025: **$2.9B operating cash flow**, **$1.9B free cash flow**; ~**85% of FCF returned to shareholders**
- Share buybacks totaled **$1 billion** in 2025, driving share count to a **decade low**
- North America represents ~**40% of revenue**; management guided for a **high-single-digit revenue decline** in North America in 2026 (following a 6% drop in 2025)
- International revenues dipped **2% in 2025**, but outperformed the broader decline in global rig activity
- HAL beat Zacks consensus estimates in **2 of the last 4 quarters**, meeting expectations in the other 2, with an average earnings surprise of ~**11%**

### Analyst Opinions (Zacks Investment Research)
- HAL assigned a **Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)** — reflecting solid fundamentals but a more balanced risk-reward after the strong rally
- The oilfield services subindustry ranks in the **top 31%** of all Zacks industries, indicating a broadly supportive backdrop
- Zacks characterizes HAL as a **"wait-and-watch" name** rather than an aggressive buy at current levels
- Near-term concern: **Q1 2026 guidance calls for sequential declines in both revenues and profitability**, with margin compression expected
- North America exposure is seen as a **valuation limiter** compared to more internationally diversified peers (SLB, Baker Hughes)
- The stock's appeal is described as leaning more on **steady cash returns than growth acceleration**

### Key Takeaways Relevant to Near-Term Price Movement
- Much of the positive news is characterized as **already priced in** following the 65% rally
- Near-term headwinds include **North American weakness** and **early 2026 margin compression**
- Longer-term positives (Latin America deepwater, Guyana, artificial lift) are acknowledged but not seen as near-term catalysts

## Summary: Halliburton Stock Jumps ~5% to Open 2026 (TechStock², January 4, 2026)

**Key Market Data:**
- HAL closed up **4.74% at $29.60** on January 3, 2026 (first trading day of the year)
- The move outperformed the broader market, consistent with oilfield services stocks' higher-beta nature relative to oil majors

**Sector Context:**
- The rally was **sector-wide**, with peers **SLB and Baker Hughes** also gaining (per Market Watch)
- Oilfield services stocks are characterized as higher-beta plays on drilling/completion activity, amplifying moves when traders rotate into energy risk
- A **steep 2025 oil price decline** had kept pressure on North American activity expectations and service pricing power heading into 2026

**Key Macro Catalysts Being Watched:**
- An **OPEC+ meeting (Jan. 4)** where the group was expected to maintain current output policy, pausing further production increases through Q1 2026 (per Reuters)
- The **U.S. Employment Situation report (Jan. 9)**, which could influence the dollar, yields, and risk appetite — all inputs feeding into energy prices

**Company-Specific Catalyst:**
- HAL's **Q4 2025 earnings release and conference call scheduled for January 21**, with investor focus on North American completion demand, international pricing, and customer budget outlooks following 2025's oil price slide (per Halliburton Investor Relations/Reuters)

**Other Notes:**
- A routine director disclosure filed Jan. 2 detailed stock-equivalent and restricted stock units tied to board compensation — flagged as a governance/pay signal rather than an operational development

# Halliburton (HAL) Comprehensive Analysis: Price Trend, Historical Base Rates & February 2026 Outlook

---

## 1. Current Price & Recent Performance

As of **20 February 2026**, HAL closed at **$35.11**, with the prior close at $35.37 (Yahoo Finance via yFinance). The reference price for the resolution question is **$35.11** (close on 22 February 2026, which aligns with the latest available data).

**Recent price trajectory (last 10 trading days):**

| Date | Close | Direction |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 2026-02-06 | $34.98 | ↑ |
| 2026-02-09 | $34.90 | ↓ |
| 2026-02-10 | $34.02 | ↓ |
| 2026-02-11 | $35.03 | ↑ |
| 2026-02-12 | $34.29 | ↓ |
| 2026-02-13 | $33.96 | ↓ |
| 2026-02-17 | $33.71 | ↓ |
| 2026-02-18 | $34.77 | ↑ |
| 2026-02-19 | $35.37 | ↑ |
| 2026-02-20 | $35.11 | ↓ |

Of the last 10 sessions, **4 were positive and 6 were negative**, suggesting mild near-term selling pressure after a strong multi-month rally. Volume has been moderate, ranging from ~7.5M to ~15M shares/day, with no exceptional volume spikes indicating institutional accumulation or distribution.

**Trailing returns:**
- 1-week: +2.4%
- 1-month: +5.2%
- 3-month: +31.9%
- 6-month: +68.7%

The 6-month surge is remarkable and reflects a recovery from the stock's 52-week low of $18.72. The stock is now near its 52-week high of $35.85, trading at the upper end of its annual range.

---

## 2. Historical Base Rate: 4-Day and 5-Day Positive Move Frequency

From the programmatic analysis of 2,510 overlapping 5-trading-day windows (2010–2026):

- **P(positive 5-day return): 51.8%**
- Mean 5-day return: +0.29%
- Median 5-day return: +0.23%
- Standard deviation: 6.68%
- 5th percentile: -9.06% | 95th percentile: +9.97%

This base rate is essentially a coin flip, slightly favoring positive outcomes. The distribution is approximately symmetric with fat tails, consistent with an energy-sector high-beta stock.

The **30-day realized volatility is 33.6% annualized**, which is elevated. Options markets confirm this: the ATM implied volatility for the 27 February 2026 expiry is **44.8% (calls) / 45.4% (puts)**, implying a **1-sigma 4-day range of $33.46–$36.76** around the current price. This options-implied range brackets the reference price of $35.11 comfortably, suggesting the market sees meaningful probability of moves in either direction.

The **put/call open interest ratio** for the 27 February expiry is **0.84** (more calls than puts), and the highest open interest put strike is $34.00 (OI: 1,842 vs. calls at $34.00 with OI: 663), suggesting some hedging activity below current levels but a modestly bullish skew in positioning.

---

## 3. Fundamental & Analyst Context

**Analyst consensus (25 analysts, Yahoo Finance):**
- Mean price target: **$36.34** (approximately 3.5% above current $35.11)
- Low target: $28.00 | High target: $46.48
- Rating breakdown: 12 Buy, 6 Hold, 0 Sell → **Moderate Buy**

Morningstar assigns a fair value of **$27.00**, significantly below current trading levels, suggesting the stock may be pricing in an optimistic scenario relative to Morningstar's conservative assumptions (Morningstar, January 22, 2026).

**Q4 2025 / Q1 2026 guidance:**
- Q1 2026 revenue is projected to **decline ~6% quarter-over-quarter**, with adjusted EBITDA expected to fall ~14% QoQ (Public.com analyst summary).
- Operating margins in the Completion & Production (C&P) segment may decline ~300 basis points.
- Full-year 2026 free cash flow is forecast at **$1.8 billion**, +6% YoY (Public.com).
- Management has cut 2026 capex by ~30% to ~$1 billion to prioritize FCF generation (Finterra/FinancialContent, January 16, 2026).

**Dividend:** Halliburton declared a **$0.17/share Q1 2026 dividend** (ninth consecutive quarter at this level), payable March 25, 2026, with a record date of March 4 and ex-dividend date of March 4. This is a minor near-term catalyst; the ex-dividend date falls just after the resolution window, so it will not mechanically depress the stock before February 28.

---

## 4. Macro & Sector Catalysts

**Oil price outlook:**
- Enverus (January 13, 2026) forecasts **Brent crude averaging ~$55/barrel in 2026**, a bearish signal for oilfield services demand. A projected **3.8 million barrel/day global surplus** in 2026 is cited as a persistent headwind (Finterra, January 2026).
- OPEC+ plans to gradually return 2 million bbl/day to market by year-end, adding further downward pressure on prices.
- WTI below $60/bbl is identified as a threshold that would trigger North American completion activity pullbacks—Halliburton's most profitable segment.

**Sector dynamics:**
- North American land activity has plateaued due to E&P consolidation, giving producers more pricing power over service companies (Finterra).
- International revenue provides a partial offset: Europe/Africa saw a 12% sequential revenue increase in Q4 2025 from higher tool sales (Intellectia.ai).
- The broader oilfield services sector faces tariff headwinds: 10–25% tariffs on non-USMCA crude feedstocks and 50% Section 232 steel/aluminum duties could increase material costs by 4–40% across the value chain (Deloitte, 2026 O&G Outlook).
- Baker Hughes is up 37% in 2026 YTD, suggesting sector-wide momentum (Intellectia.ai), though HAL's North American concentration makes it more vulnerable to domestic softness.

**Geopolitical risk premium:** Middle East tensions and Strait of Hormuz risks have prevented oil prices from collapsing despite the surplus, providing some floor support for HAL's international margins.

---

## 5. Technical & Positioning Summary

- HAL is trading near its **52-week high ($35.85)**, having rallied ~87% from its 52-week low of $18.72.
- The 3-month return of +31.9% represents a sharp mean-reversion rally; the stock may face resistance near current levels.
- The 1-year mean price is $24.53 (std dev $4.36), meaning the current price is approximately **2.4 standard deviations above the 1-year mean**—a historically stretched position.
- The forward P/E of **13.1x** is reasonable for the sector, but the trailing P/E of **23.4x** reflects compressed near-term earnings.

---

## 6. Probability Assessment for Resolution (Feb 22 → Feb 28)

**Factors favoring YES (close Feb 28 > Feb 22 close of $35.11):**
- Historical base rate: 51.8% probability of a positive 5-day return
- Analyst mean target ($36.34) is above current price, providing modest upside bias
- Moderate Buy consensus with no Sell ratings
- Dividend announcement reinforces financial stability narrative
- Options put/call ratio of 0.84 suggests slightly more bullish positioning
- Sector peers (Baker Hughes) showing strong 2026 momentum

**Factors favoring NO:**
- Stock is near 52-week high ($35.85), creating technical resistance
- Q1 2026 guidance is weak: -6% revenue, -14% EBITDA QoQ
- Bearish oil price outlook ($55 Brent average per Enverus)
- Morningstar fair value of $27 implies significant overvaluation at current levels
- 6 of last 10 sessions were negative; recent momentum has softened
- Elevated implied volatility (44–45%) reflects genuine uncertainty
- Global oil surplus of 3.8 Mbbl/day is a structural headwind
- Tariff-related cost pressures on the OFS supply chain

**Synthesis:** The historical base rate of ~52% for a positive 5-day return serves as the primary anchor. Current conditions present a mixed picture: the stock has had a massive rally and faces near-term fundamental headwinds (weak Q1 guidance, bearish oil outlook), but analyst sentiment remains constructive and the dividend/FCF story provides support. The options market's 1-sigma range ($33.46–$36.76) encompasses both outcomes with roughly equal probability. Adjusting slightly downward from the 51.8% base rate given the proximity to 52-week highs, weak near-term guidance, and bearish macro backdrop, the probability of a YES resolution is approximately **48–52%**, essentially a coin flip with a very slight lean toward NO given the technical and fundamental headwinds at current price levels.</Agent_report>
