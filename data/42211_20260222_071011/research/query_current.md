Analysis:
To judge whether HAL will close higher on 28 Feb 2026 than on 22 Feb 2026, I need very recent information that could move the share price over the coming five trading days.  Key drivers are:  
• Any just-released or imminent earnings results, guidance, or SEC filings.  
• Analyst upgrades/downgrades, target-price changes, or options activity dated mid- to late-Feb 2026.  
• News on crude-oil price movements, OPEC decisions, U.S. rig counts, or geopolitical events that sway oil-service demand.  
• Halliburton-specific contract wins, technology launches, buybacks, dividend declarations, or litigation headlines since 16 Feb 2026.  
Therefore the searches should focus on Halliburton’s latest corporate news and the broader oilfield-services and crude-oil context during the week of 16–22 Feb 2026.
