Analysis:
The payoff hinges on a very short-horizon price move (4 trading days).  Helpful outside-view context therefore includes:
• How often HAL’s price is higher four trading days later in historical data (baseline probability).  
• How HAL typically reacts to catalysts likely to occur before 28 Feb 2026 (e.g., oil-price swings, U.S. rig count releases, ex-dividend/earnings dates).  
• The current trend in crude-oil prices, because HAL’s revenue is tightly linked to oil & gas activity.  
To build this context we need: (a) historical HAL daily closes; (b) recent and forthcoming news about Halliburton and the oil-services sector; (c) recent crude-oil price series from FRED.
