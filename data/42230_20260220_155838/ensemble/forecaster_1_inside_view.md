Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **GOV.UK "Biggest overhaul of legal migration" announcement** – Official government source. High quality, primary. Confirms the 10-year baseline policy announcement and tiered system. Factual: describes proposals, not yet enacted law. Published pre-February 2026.

2. **UK in a Changing Europe (Feb 13, 2026)** – Academic policy analysis by James Bowes (University of Warwick). Credible secondary source. Describes proposals as still in consultation phase (consultation closed Feb 12, 2026). Key factual point: policy not yet enacted as of Feb 13, 2026. Notes "policy changes expected by April 2026."

3. **Jobbatical (immigration advisory)** – Commercial HR/immigration platform. Secondary source with commercial interest. Describes the policy as "now in force" with "implementation from April 2026" — this appears to be anticipatory/forward-looking language, not confirmed enacted law. Treat with caution; likely premature.

4. **Richmond Chambers (immigration barristers, Dec 2024)** – Describes the *existing* 10-year long residence route, not the new proposal. Useful for context but not directly relevant to resolution.

5. **Employment Law Worldview (Dec 8, 2025)** – Law firm analysis. Professional, credible. Notes "Statement of Changes expected: Spring 2026" and "Implementation likely to begin: Summer 2026 onwards" — this is notably more cautious than the April 2026 target stated by the Home Secretary. Moderate quality expert opinion.

6. **VisaHQ (Feb 12, 2026)** – Immigration services company (commercial interest). Aggregator, not primary source. Reports consultation closed Feb 12; Home Office "aims to publish final rules in April 2026." Moderate quality. Key fact: "Home Office plans to analyse submissions over ~6 weeks and aims to publish final rules in April 2026."

7. **AskNews - The Tablet (Feb 19, 2026)** – Catholic publication reporting on JRS UK criticism. Credible secondary source. Key factual claim: "policy changes expected by April 2026." Consultation closed Feb 12, 2026.

8. **AskNews - Birmingham Mail (Feb 20, 2026)** – Regional news outlet. Reports DWP plans to double waiting period for migrants to access benefits from 5 to 10 years. Confirms government spokesperson's stance. Current news (today's date).

9. **AskNews - The Sun (Feb 19, 2026)** – Tabloid. Reports government spokesperson confirmed "plans to double the waiting period for benefits from 2 to 10 years." Consistent with broader policy direction.

10. **AskNews - Financial Express (Jan 18, 2026)** – Business publication. Notes "implementation is anticipated to begin in April 2026, though the changes are not yet legally binding." Moderate quality.

11. **AskNews - Business Standard (Dec 18, 2025)** – Business publication. Reports "new rules expected to take effect from April 2025" (likely typo for April 2026). Confirms broad policy direction.

12. **AskNews - JD Supra (Nov 26, 2025)** – Legal publication. High quality. States "implementation planned for April 2026." Confirms consultation closed Feb 12, 2026.

13. **AskNews - ThePrint (Nov 21, 2025)** – Indian news outlet. Reports changes "set to take effect in April 2026." Consistent with other sources.

14. **AskNews - News18 (Nov 20, 2025)** – Indian news outlet. Reports consultation running until February 2026, implementation planned for April 2026. Consistent.

15. **AskNews - Manchester Evening News (Nov 20, 2025)** – Regional UK news. Reports "reforms are expected to be rolled out in spring 2026." Slightly vaguer than April specifically.

16. **AskNews - The Independent (Nov 20, 2025)** – Quality UK newspaper. Reports Home Secretary's announcement. High quality. Factual reporting on the policy announcement.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence favoring YES (implementation before May 2026):**
- **Home Secretary explicitly stated April 2026 implementation** (Hansard, November 2025 — cited in background). This is a direct ministerial commitment on the parliamentary record. Multiple independent sources (JD Supra, ThePrint, Financial Express, VisaHQ, The Tablet) all corroborate April 2026 as the target.
- **Administrative mechanism (Statement of Changes)** does not require primary legislation. The UK Home Office routinely implements immigration rule changes via this mechanism, which requires only 21 parliamentary sitting days of negative resolution procedure. This is a well-established, fast-track mechanism.
- **Consultation closed February 12, 2026** — the government has completed the formal consultation process. The next step is publishing the Statement of Changes.
- **GOV.UK official announcement** frames the 10-year baseline as a decided policy, not merely a proposal subject to reversal. The consultation was on *transitional arrangements*, not on whether to implement the 10-year baseline.

**Moderate evidence favoring YES:**
- **Multiple law firms advised clients to bring forward ILR applications before April 2026** — professional consensus among immigration practitioners that implementation is likely on schedule.
- **Strong political motivation**: Labour faces pressure from Reform UK on immigration; 21% of Britons cite immigration as top concern. Delay would be politically costly.
- **VisaHQ reports Home Office "aims to publish final rules in April 2026"** — consistent with the ministerial statement.

**Moderate evidence favoring NO (delay past May 1, 2026):**
- **Employment Law Worldview (law firm) suggests "Summer 2026 onwards"** — a credible expert source suggesting the timeline may slip beyond April. This is a meaningful dissenting voice from a professional source.
- **No draft rules published as of February 18-20, 2026** — with only ~6 weeks to April 6, the absence of published draft rules is concerning. The 21-day parliamentary sitting period must be counted carefully.
- **VisaHQ notes "~6 weeks" for Home Office to analyse submissions** — if analysis begins February 12, six weeks takes us to approximately March 26, leaving very little time to lay the Statement of Changes and allow the 21-day period before April 6.
- **Legal challenges**: Law Society warned about Equality Act concerns; retrospective application could trigger judicial review. However, judicial review typically doesn't block implementation immediately.

**Weak evidence favoring NO:**
- Jobbatical describes policy as "now in force" — but this appears to be premature/anticipatory language from a commercial source.
- Political opposition from NGOs, business groups — unlikely to derail given strong government commitment.

**Critical timing calculation:**
- Consultation closed: February 12, 2026
- If Home Office takes 6 weeks to analyze: ~March 26, 2026
- Statement of Changes must be laid 21 parliamentary sitting days before commencement
- Parliament sitting days in March-April 2026: approximately 15-20 days (accounting for Easter recess, typically mid-April)
- Easter 2026: April 2-5 (Good Friday to Easter Monday)
- If Statement laid ~March 26, 21 sitting days later would be approximately late April/early May 2026

This is genuinely tight. However, governments often pre-draft Statements of Changes before consultations close (since the 10-year baseline was decided in November 2025, not during consultation). The consultation was specifically about transitional arrangements, not the core 10-year baseline.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Current date**: February 20, 2026
- **Resolution deadline**: May 1, 2026
- **Target implementation**: April 2026 (~10 weeks away)
- **Time window**: ~10 weeks

If the timeframe were halved (~5 weeks, to ~March 27): probability would drop significantly to ~30-40%, as there would be insufficient time for parliamentary procedure even with pre-drafted rules.

If the timeframe were doubled (~20 weeks, to ~July 1): probability would rise to ~85-90%, as the government would have ample time to implement even with delays.

The current 10-week window is tight but feasible. The critical question is whether the government pre-drafted the Statement of Changes (likely, given the 10-year baseline was decided in November 2025) and whether the parliamentary sitting calendar allows 21 sitting days before April 30.

**(d) Justification**

**Key factors shifting from outside view base rate of 70%:**

1. **The consultation was about transitional arrangements, not the 10-year baseline itself** — the baseline was already decided. This means the government likely pre-drafted the core rules in November-December 2025 and the consultation period doesn't delay the main policy. This is a significant upward factor.

2. **Parliamentary timing risk** — the 21-day sitting day requirement combined with Easter recess (April 2-5) creates genuine risk that even a March 26 Statement of Changes might not complete the 21-day period before May 1. However, if the Statement is laid in early-to-mid March (which is possible if pre-drafted), it would clear the 21-day hurdle before Easter. This is a moderate downward factor.

3. **Employment Law Worldview's "Summer 2026" estimate** — a credible law firm source suggesting slippage. However, this may reflect conservative professional advice rather than insider knowledge. Moderate downward factor.

4. **Multiple corroborating sources on April 2026** — the consistency across sources (including Hansard) is strong evidence. Upward factor.

5. **The question resolves Yes if the change affects "at least some applicants" before May 1** — even a partial implementation (e.g., applying to new applications from April 6) would suffice. This lowers the bar for Yes resolution.

**Net assessment**: The outside view base rate of 70% seems approximately correct. The pre-drafting argument and the low bar for resolution (affects "at least some applicants") push upward. The tight parliamentary timeline and the Employment Law Worldview dissent push downward. I'll maintain approximately 70%, perhaps nudging slightly upward to 72% given the pre-drafting argument and the low resolution bar.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view established 70%. Inside view factors:
- Pre-drafting of core rules (upward): +3%
- Low resolution bar ("at least some applicants") (upward): +2%
- Employment Law Worldview "Summer 2026" dissent (downward): -3%
- No draft rules published as of Feb 20 (downward): -2%
- Strong ministerial commitment on Hansard record (upward): +2%

Net adjustment: +2%, yielding approximately 72%.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the UK's baseline ILR qualifying period be increased to 10+ years, in effect for at least some applicants, before May 1, 2026? ✓

2. **Outside view base rate**: 70% (UK government immigration rule changes via Statement of Changes, on stated timeline). Final prediction: 72%. Rooted in base rate with modest inside-view adjustments. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "72 out of 100 times, the UK implements the 10-year baseline ILR requirement affecting at least some applicants before May 1, 2026." This is consistent with strong political will, administrative mechanism, April target, but genuine timing risk. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - Home Secretary's Hansard statement: April 2026 implementation (strong, factual) ✓
   - Consultation closed Feb 12, 2026; baseline was pre-decided in November 2025 (strong, factual) ✓
   - Statement of Changes mechanism: no primary legislation needed (strong, structural) ✓
   - Employment Law Worldview: "Summer 2026" timeline (moderate, expert opinion) ✓
   - No draft rules published as of Feb 20, 2026 (moderate, factual) ✓

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: The Home Office announces the Statement of Changes in late March/early April 2026, but due to Easter recess and parliamentary sitting day calculations, the 21-day period doesn't complete until after May 1, 2026. This would resolve No despite the government's clear intention. Probability of this specific scenario: ~15-20%.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is 5-year baseline. The question asks whether it changes before May 1. Given strong government commitment and administrative mechanism, the status quo is likely to change — but timing risk is real.

Probability: 72%
