Analysis:

**Source Analysis:**

1. **GOV.UK ILR page** – Official government source reflecting current rules (5-year baseline). Factual, authoritative, but describes pre-change status quo.

2. **GOV.UK "Fairer Pathway to Settlement" consultation** – Official government consultation document (CP 1448, November 2025). High quality, primary source. Key factual claim: Home Secretary stated the 10-year baseline is "already announced" as a done decision, not merely proposed. Consultation closed February 12, 2026.

3. **GOV.UK immigration statistics (year ending September 2025)** – Official Home Office statistics. Factual, high quality. Confirms 5-year baseline still in effect as of publication; EUSS grants (330,745) represent 67% of total grants but are explicitly out of scope of the reform.

4. **Gallup poll (February 11, 2026)** – Reputable polling organization. Factual data on public concern about immigration in UK. Relevant context for political pressure driving reform.

5. **IPPR analysis** – Left-leaning think tank, policy analysis. Credible expert opinion. Estimates ~1.35 million people affected; recommends grandfathering clause. Opinion-heavy but factually grounded.

6. **Jobbatical article** – Commercial HR/immigration platform. Secondary source. Notably describes the policy as "now in force" with "implementation from April 2026" — but this appears to be forward-looking/anticipatory rather than confirmed enacted law. Should be treated cautiously.

7. **UK in a Changing Europe (February 13, 2026)** – Academic/think tank analysis. Author is James Bowes from University of Warwick. Credible analysis. Describes proposals as not yet enacted, characterizes them as potentially "remigration by stealth."

8. **Erickson Immigration Group (November 25, 2025)** – Immigration law firm. Professional, practitioner-oriented. Factual reporting on proposals; notes implementation planned for April 2026 via "Statement of Changes."

9. **Morgan Lewis (November 24, 2025)** – Major law firm. High quality professional analysis. Confirms April 2026 target implementation; advises employers to bring forward ILR applications before April 2026.

10. **Agent report (February 18, 2026)** – Synthesized research. Confirms: no draft Immigration Rules, statutory instruments, or commencement orders have been laid as of mid-February 2026. The measure remains at pre-legislative (consultation) stage. Implementation via negative resolution procedure (Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules). Target: April 2026 (likely April 6, 2026 aligned with tax year).

**Reference Class Analysis:**

Several reference classes are relevant:

1. **UK government immigration policy announcements that proceed to implementation on stated timeline**: The UK government has a reasonable track record of implementing immigration rule changes via Statements of Changes, which don't require primary legislation. These can move quickly. However, the 12-week consultation period and need to process responses adds some delay risk.

2. **UK government policy announcements that get delayed or reversed**: UK immigration policy has seen some reversals (e.g., Rwanda policy), but typically these involve primary legislation or significant political opposition. This proposal has cross-party support in the sense that reducing net migration is broadly popular.

3. **Immigration rule changes via Statement of Changes**: These are routine administrative mechanisms. The UK Home Office regularly uses these. The April 2026 timeline is tight but feasible — the agent report notes the negative resolution procedure requires only 21 parliamentary sitting days before commencement.

The most suitable reference class is: **UK government immigration policy changes announced with a specific implementation date that proceed via Immigration Rules (Statement of Changes) rather than primary legislation**. These have a high implementation rate (~80-90%) when the government has publicly committed and the mechanism is administrative rather than legislative.

**Timeframe Analysis:**

- Today: February 20, 2026
- Resolution deadline: May 1, 2026
- Target implementation: April 2026 (approximately 6 weeks away)
- Time remaining: ~10 weeks

The critical path:
- Consultation closed February 12, 2026
- Government response needed (typically 6-8 weeks, so ~late March/early April)
- Statement of Changes must be laid 21 parliamentary sitting days before commencement
- If commencement is April 6, 2026, the Statement would need to be laid by approximately early-to-mid March 2026

This is a very tight timeline. The agent report notes no draft rules have been published as of February 18, 2026. However, the government has been clear this is a done deal on the 10-year baseline.

Historical patterns: UK governments frequently implement immigration rule changes on stated timelines when using the Statement of Changes mechanism. The May 2025 White Paper → November 2025 consultation → April 2026 implementation is a compressed but not unprecedented timeline.

**Justification:**

Key factors favoring YES (implementation before May 2026):
1. The Home Secretary explicitly stated in November 2025 that changes would come into effect in April 2026
2. The government framed the 10-year baseline as "already announced" — not merely proposed
3. The mechanism (Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules) doesn't require primary legislation
4. Strong political motivation: 21% of Britons cite immigration as top concern; Labour faces pressure from Reform UK
5. The consultation closed February 12, 2026, giving ~7 weeks to April 6 for government response and rule-laying
6. Multiple law firms advised clients to bring forward ILR applications before April 2026, suggesting professional consensus that implementation is likely

Key factors favoring NO (failure to implement before May 2026):
1. No draft rules published as of February 18, 2026 — very tight timeline
2. Significant legal concerns about retrospective application could prompt judicial review or delay
3. Consultation responses may require more time to process than anticipated
4. Political opposition from business groups, NGOs, and some Labour backbenchers
5. The Jobbatical source may be premature in describing the policy as "in force"
6. Even if announced, the question requires the change to "come into effect" before May 1, 2026 — a delay to, say, May 2026 would resolve No

The balance of evidence strongly suggests implementation is the government's firm intention and the mechanism is available. The main risk is timing — the April 2026 target is tight given the consultation only just closed. However, governments often pre-draft rules before consultations close, and the 10-year baseline was described as a done decision.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for UK government immigration policy changes proceeding on stated timelines via Statement of Changes is high — perhaps 75-85%. However, the specific constraint here is not just "will it happen" but "will it happen before May 1, 2026."

Given:
- April 2026 target stated by Home Secretary
- Administrative (not legislative) mechanism
- Strong political will
- But: no draft rules published as of Feb 18, 2026
- Tight timeline (consultation just closed)
- Risk of delay to, say, May or June 2026

The probability that implementation occurs specifically before May 1, 2026 (as opposed to later in 2026) is somewhat lower than the probability it happens at all. I estimate:
- P(implemented at all in 2026) ≈ 85%
- P(implemented before May 1 | implemented in 2026) ≈ 75% (given April target, some risk of slippage)
- P(implemented before May 1) ≈ 85% × 75% + small probability of earlier-than-April implementation ≈ 65%

But I should also consider: the government has been very explicit about April 2026, and the Statement of Changes mechanism is well-practiced. The tight timeline is a genuine concern, but governments often pre-draft these instruments. I'll adjust upward slightly to ~70%.

Outside View Prediction: 70%
