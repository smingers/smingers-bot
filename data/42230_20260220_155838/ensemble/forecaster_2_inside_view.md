Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **GOV.UK official announcement ("Biggest overhaul of legal migration model in 50 years")** — Official government source, high credibility. States the 10-year baseline is announced and describes the tiered system. This is a policy announcement, not yet law, but represents the government's formal position. Date unclear from summary but consistent with November 2025 announcement.

2. **UK in a Changing Europe (Feb 13, 2026)** — Academic policy analysis organization. Author is a university analyst (James Bowes), not a senior immigration expert, so opinions carry moderate weight. Factual description of the consultation and proposed tiers is reliable. Notes consultation closed February 13, 2026. Credible for descriptive facts.

3. **Jobbatical (HR/immigration advisory, undated but describes April 2026 implementation)** — Secondary commercial source. States the framework is "now in force" with "implementation from April 2026." This appears to be forward-looking/anticipatory rather than confirmed. Low-moderate credibility; commercial bias. Treat with caution.

4. **Richmond Chambers immigration barristers (Dec 2024)** — Describes the *existing* 10-year long residence route, not the proposed change. High credibility for what it covers, but not directly relevant to the policy change question.

5. **Employment Law Worldview (Dec 8, 2025)** — Legal practitioner source (Carine Elliott). Notes consultation closes February 12, 2026, and suggests "Statement of Changes expected Spring 2026" with "implementation likely Summer 2026 onwards." This is **at odds** with the April 2026 target. Moderate credibility; raises genuine uncertainty about timing.

6. **VisaHQ (Feb 12, 2026)** — Immigration services aggregator. States Home Office plans to "publish final rules in April 2026" after ~6 weeks of analysis post-consultation. Moderate credibility; cites Law Society concerns about retrospective application. The April 2026 publication date aligns with the Home Secretary's November 2025 statement.

7. **The Tablet (Feb 19, 2026)** — Reputable Catholic publication. Cites JRS UK, ENS, ILPA, and other expert groups opposing the policy. States "policy changes expected by April 2026." Credible for advocacy positions; confirms the April 2026 timeline is widely understood.

8. **Birmingham Mail / The Sun (Feb 19-20, 2026)** — Tabloid sources. Report on DWP plans to double waiting period for benefits. Confirm government spokesperson language about the 10-year plan. Low-moderate credibility individually but corroborate the policy direction.

9. **The Financial Express (Jan 18, 2026)** — States "implementation is anticipated to begin in April 2026, though the changes are not yet legally binding." Moderate credibility; consistent with other sources.

10. **Business Standard (Dec 18, 2025)** — Notes "new rules expected to take effect from April 2025" (likely a typo for April 2026). Describes Indian migrant concerns. Moderate credibility for factual description.

11. **JD Supra (Nov 26, 2025)** — Legal news aggregator. States "implementation planned for April 2026." Reliable for legal procedural context.

12. **Manchester Evening News / News18 / The Independent / ThePrint (Nov 20-21, 2025)** — Various credibility levels. All report the November 2025 announcement consistently. The Independent is high credibility; others moderate. All confirm the April 2026 target.

**Key expert opinion**: The Law Society of England & Wales (named, reliable) raised concerns about retrospective application and Equality Act compliance — this could create legal challenges but not necessarily delay implementation.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence favoring YES (implementation before May 2026):**

1. **Official government announcement with specific April 2026 target**: The Home Secretary stated in Parliament (Hansard, November 2025) that changes would come into effect in April 2026. This is a formal parliamentary commitment by a Cabinet minister. Multiple independent sources (JD Supra, The Tablet, VisaHQ, Financial Express, Manchester Evening News) all cite April 2026. **Strong evidence** — direct causal mechanism, multiple independent sources.

2. **Consultation closed February 12-13, 2026**: The consultation has now closed. The government stated it would analyze submissions over ~6 weeks and publish final rules in April 2026. The timeline is tight but feasible. **Moderate-strong evidence** — the process is advancing as planned.

3. **Immigration Rules use negative procedure**: Changes to Immigration Rules do not require primary legislation. A Statement of Changes is laid before Parliament with 21 sitting days notice. This is a well-established, fast mechanism. The government's large Commons majority means annulment is essentially impossible. **Strong structural evidence**.

4. **Political incentives strongly favor delivery**: The reform is framed as essential to manage 1.6 million projected ILR grants by 2030. Immigration is the top public concern (21% of Britons per Gallup). Failure to deliver would be politically damaging against Reform UK and Conservatives. **Moderate-strong evidence**.

**Moderate evidence favoring YES:**

5. **GOV.UK official consultation page explicitly states 10-year baseline**: The government's own consultation document confirms the 10-year baseline as the announced policy. This isn't just a proposal — it's been formally stated as the government's decision with consultation only on transitional arrangements. **Moderate evidence** (policy decided, implementation pending).

6. **Jobbatical describes framework as "now in force" with April 2026 implementation**: While this is a commercial source and may be anticipatory, it suggests practitioners are treating April 2026 as near-certain. **Weak-moderate evidence**.

**Evidence raising uncertainty / favoring NO:**

7. **Employment Law Worldview suggests "Summer 2026" implementation**: One practitioner source suggests the timeline may slip to summer 2026. This is a single source and contradicts multiple others, but raises some uncertainty. **Weak-moderate evidence against**.

8. **Legal challenges possible**: Law Society raised Equality Act concerns about retrospective application. However, even if challenged, the rules could still come into force before May 2026 (judicial review doesn't automatically suspend implementation). **Weak evidence against**.

9. **Consultation closed only ~8 days ago (as of Feb 20, 2026)**: Officials must process potentially thousands of submissions in ~6 weeks to hit April 2026. This is tight. However, the government has indicated the core decision (10-year baseline) is already made; consultation was primarily about transitional arrangements. **Moderate evidence of timing risk**.

10. **Resolution requires the change to "affect at least some applicants before May 2026"**: Even if rules are published in April 2026, they need to actually come into effect and affect applicants before May 1. If implementation is April 6 or April 28, this is satisfied. If delayed to May or later, it fails. **Timing precision matters**.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Days until resolution**: 70 days (Feb 20 to May 1, 2026)
- **Government's stated target**: April 2026 (roughly 40-70 days away)
- **If timeframe halved** (~35 days, mid-March): Much less likely to resolve YES, as the Statement of Changes would need to be laid immediately and the 21 sitting-day requirement would barely be met.
- **If timeframe doubled** (~140 days, late June): Probability would increase substantially (85%+), as the summer 2026 implementation suggested by some sources would be captured.

The current 70-day window is tight but consistent with the government's stated April 2026 target. The key risk is a slip from April to May or later.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting point**: Outside view base rate of 68%.

**Upward adjustments**:
- The government has made an unusually explicit parliamentary commitment to April 2026 implementation (+5 pp). This is stronger than a typical "spring" target.
- The consultation has now closed, removing one potential delay source (+3 pp).
- The negative procedure mechanism is fast and reliable; no legislative obstacles (+3 pp).
- Political incentives are extremely strong — this is a flagship immigration reform (+2 pp).

**Downward adjustments**:
- Only 70 days remain; even a small administrative delay could push past May 1 (-4 pp).
- The Employment Law Worldview source suggests "summer 2026" — while a minority view, it reflects genuine uncertainty about processing 10,000+ consultation responses in 6 weeks (-3 pp).
- The resolution requires the change to actually affect applicants (not just be announced) before May 1 (-2 pp). If rules are published April 28 but don't come into force until May 1, it fails.
- Legal challenge risk (though unlikely to suspend implementation before May 1) (-1 pp).

**Net adjustment**: +13 pp upward, -10 pp downward = net +3 pp

**Inside view prediction**: 68% + 3% = **71%**

However, I want to be careful here. The Jobbatical source (commercial, forward-looking) describes the framework as "now in force" with April 2026 implementation — but this appears to be anticipatory rather than confirmed. The most reliable sources (GOV.UK, Hansard, multiple legal practitioners) consistently point to April 2026 as the target. The Employment Law Worldview's "summer 2026" estimate is an outlier.

The critical uncertainty is whether "April 2026" means the rules will be in force and affecting applicants before May 1. Given that the Home Secretary specifically said "April 2026" in Parliament, and the negative procedure requires only 21 sitting days, this seems achievable if the Statement of Changes is laid in early-to-mid March.

**Final calibration**: ~72%

---

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view is 68%. The inside view evidence, particularly the explicit parliamentary commitment to April 2026 and the closed consultation, pushes this modestly upward to ~72%. The main risk is a timing slip of just a few weeks that would push implementation past May 1, 2026. This is a real but not dominant risk given the political commitment and procedural mechanics.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the UK's baseline qualifying period for permanent residency increase to 10+ years, coming into effect before May 1, 2026? Yes, aligns with resolution criteria.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 68% from reference class of major UK immigration rule changes with announced timelines. Final prediction of 72% is a modest upward adjustment, grounded in the base rate.

3. **Consistency check**: "72 out of 100 times, the UK implements the 10-year baseline settlement requirement before May 1, 2026." This is consistent with the evidence of a strong political commitment with a tight but feasible timeline.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - Home Secretary's parliamentary statement: April 2026 implementation (strong, reliable)
   - Consultation closed February 12-13, 2026 (process advancing as planned)
   - Negative procedure mechanism — no legislative obstacles (structural)
   - Employment Law Worldview suggests "summer 2026" (uncertainty)
   - 70-day window is tight; any slip past May 1 fails resolution

5. **Blind spot**: The government could announce the rules in April but with a commencement date of May 1 or later (e.g., to allow transitional arrangements). This would fail resolution despite the policy being "announced." This scenario could reduce probability by ~8-10 pp if it materialized.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is 5-year baseline. The change requires active implementation. Given the strong political momentum, the status quo is unlikely to persist, but timing uncertainty remains.

Probability: 72%
