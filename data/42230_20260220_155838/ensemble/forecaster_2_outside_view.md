Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**GOV.UK - ILR page**: Official government source confirming current 5-year baseline. Factual, reliable, reflects rules as of publication (no changes enacted yet).

**GOV.UK - "A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" consultation**: Official government consultation document (CP 1448), November 2025. High quality primary source. Key factual claim: Home Secretary states the 10-year baseline is "already announced" as a confirmed decision, with consultation focused on surrounding conditions. Implementation target: April 2026.

**GOV.UK - Immigration statistics (year ending Sept 2025)**: Official statistics. Confirms 5-year baseline still in effect. Useful for fine-print analysis (majority of grants). EUSS grants (330,745) represent 67% of total grants but are explicitly out of scope. Non-EUSS grants (158,137): work-related (59,642), family (43,942), refugee (35,725), other (18,828). Work-related grants are the largest non-EUSS category.

**Gallup poll (Feb 11, 2026)**: Reputable polling organization. Factual data on public concern about immigration in UK. Supports political motivation for the policy.

**IPPR analysis**: Left-leaning think tank, clearly identified. Opinion piece with factual estimates. Advocates for grandfathering clause. Estimates ~1.35 million people affected. Credible analytical source but has a policy perspective.

**Jobbatical article**: Commercial HR/immigration services platform. Describes the policy as "now in force" with "implementation from April 2026." This appears to be forward-looking/anticipatory rather than confirmed enacted law. Lower reliability - secondary source.

**UK in a Changing Europe (Feb 13, 2026)**: Academic/policy analysis. Author is from University of Warwick. Credible analysis of the consultation's implications. Factual about the proposals, analytical about impacts.

**Erickson Immigration Group (Nov 25, 2025)**: Immigration law firm. Professional, practitioner-oriented. Reliable for factual reporting on proposals. Notes implementation planned for April 2026.

**Morgan Lewis (Nov 24, 2025)**: Major international law firm. High quality practitioner source. Advises employers to bring forward ILR applications before April 2026. Confirms April 2026 implementation target.

**Agent Report (Feb 18, 2026)**: Comprehensive synthesis. Key finding: As of mid-February 2026, no draft Immigration Rules (Statement of Changes) have been published, no statutory instruments or commencement orders laid. The proposal is still at pre-legislative (consultation) stage. The consultation closed February 12, 2026. Government response expected within ~6 weeks (late March 2026), followed by laying of Immigration Rules with 21 parliamentary days notice before coming into force.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

**Reference Class 1: UK government immigration policy announcements that are implemented on schedule**
The UK government regularly amends Immigration Rules via Statements of Changes, which are negative resolution instruments requiring only 21 days' notice. The government has a strong track record of implementing announced immigration rule changes on schedule when they don't require primary legislation. The 2012 "hostile environment" changes, various salary threshold increases, and the Points-Based System reforms all proceeded largely on announced timelines. This reference class suggests high probability (~75-85%) of on-schedule implementation.

**Reference Class 2: UK policy consultations that result in implementation within 6 months**
When the UK government opens a consultation with a stated implementation date, and the consultation closes, the government typically proceeds to implement (possibly with modifications). The consultation here closed February 12, 2026, with April 2026 implementation target. The tight timeline (roughly 6-8 weeks from consultation close to implementation) is aggressive but not unprecedented for Immigration Rules changes. However, the complexity and controversy of this particular change (affecting ~2 million people, potential legal challenges, significant employer concerns) could cause delays. This reference class suggests ~60-70% probability of April 2026 implementation.

**Reference Class 3: Controversial immigration policy changes facing legal challenges**
When policies face significant legal challenge threats (legitimate expectation, Equality Act concerns), governments sometimes delay implementation to refine transitional arrangements. The HSMP Forum precedent (2009) is cited by practitioners. This reference class suggests some downward pressure.

**Most suitable reference class**: A combination of Reference Classes 1 and 2, weighted toward the government's stated commitment and the procedural simplicity of Immigration Rules amendments, tempered by the controversy and tight timeline.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question resolves May 1, 2026. Today is February 20, 2026. That's approximately 70 days.

The government's stated implementation date is April 2026 (specifically, likely April 6, 2026 - start of UK tax year). For this to happen:
- Government response to consultation: ~late March 2026
- Statement of Changes laid in Parliament: ~late March/early April 2026
- 21 parliamentary days notice: this is the critical constraint
- If laid by ~March 6, 2026, could come into force April 6, 2026

The timeline is tight but feasible. The agent report notes no draft Rules have been published as of February 18, 2026, which means the government needs to move quickly.

Historical pattern: UK governments frequently announce immigration rule changes with tight timelines and implement them. The negative resolution procedure means Parliament cannot easily block it (would need a motion to annul, which is rare for immigration rules).

**(d) Justification**

Key factors supporting YES (implementation before May 2026):
1. The Home Secretary explicitly stated April 2026 implementation in Parliament (Hansard, November 20, 2025)
2. The consultation has closed (February 12, 2026), removing a key procedural hurdle
3. Immigration Rules changes don't require primary legislation - much lower bar
4. Strong political will: Labour government under pressure on immigration, with Reform UK gaining ground
5. The government framed the 10-year baseline as "already announced" - not merely proposed
6. Multiple law firms advising clients to rush ILR applications before April 2026, suggesting market expectation of implementation
7. The Jobbatical source (though lower reliability) describes it as "now in force" from April 2026

Key factors supporting NO (delay or failure before May 2026):
1. No draft Immigration Rules published as of February 18, 2026 - very tight timeline
2. Significant legal challenge risk (legitimate expectation, Equality Act)
3. Complexity of transitional arrangements still unresolved
4. Consultation responses may require significant policy refinement
5. Even if delayed to June/July 2026, the question resolves May 1 - a delay of even a few weeks would cause NO resolution
6. Parliamentary opposition could create political pressure (though not legally blocking)
7. The fine-print condition: "majority of grants" - EUSS grants (67% of total) are out of scope, so the question focuses on non-EUSS grants. Among non-EUSS grants, work-related (59,642) and family (43,942) are the largest categories. Both are proposed to move to 10-year baseline. This fine-print condition seems likely to be satisfied if the policy is implemented.

The critical question is whether implementation happens before May 1, 2026. The government has a clear stated intent for April 2026. The procedural mechanism (Immigration Rules) is straightforward. The main risk is a delay - either due to complexity of transitional arrangements, legal pre-action letters causing pause, or simply administrative/parliamentary scheduling.

Given the strong political commitment, the procedural simplicity, the closed consultation, and the stated April 2026 date, I assess the probability at around 65-72%. The main downside risk is a delay past May 1, 2026, which is plausible given the tight timeline and complexity.

Outside view calibration:

Base rate for UK government implementing announced immigration rule changes on stated schedule: ~75-80%

Adjustments:
- Downward: Exceptional complexity, retroactive application controversy, legal challenge risk, no draft Rules published yet (-10%)
- Downward: Very tight timeline from consultation close (Feb 12) to implementation (April 6) - only ~7 weeks (-5%)
- Upward: Strong political motivation, negative resolution procedure (low parliamentary hurdle), Home Secretary's explicit parliamentary commitment (+5%)
- Upward: Market/practitioner behavior (advising clients to rush applications) suggests high confidence in April 2026 (+3%)

Net adjustment: approximately -7% from base rate of ~77% → ~70%

The question asks about "before May 2026" not "in April 2026" specifically, giving an additional month of buffer. If April implementation fails, there's still May 1 as a deadline. However, the question requires the change to "come into effect" before May 1, not just be announced. A delay to May would likely push past May 1.
