Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution alignment  
Will UK rules in force before **May 1, 2026** set the **baseline** qualifying period for **settlement / permanent residency (ILR baseline)** to **≥10 years**, affecting at least some applicants before that date.

(a) Source analysis (what’s new, and how trustworthy)
- GOV.UK (consultation: “A Fairer Pathway to Settlement”, Nov 2025; consultation closed Feb 2026)  
  Primary source. Distinguishes: baseline moving to **10 years**, with “earned” adjustments up/down. High reliability for intent, not by itself proof of *in-force* rules.
- Hansard (Nov 20, 2025)  
  Primary parliamentary record; Home Secretary indicated effective timing (April 2026). Strong for stated plan, not dispositive for delivery.
- GOV.UK news release (“biggest overhaul…”)  
  Primary comms. High reliability that government is committed to the change; still not itself the legal instrument.
- UK in a Changing Europe (Feb 13, 2026)  
  Credible academic-policy analysis; good for understanding scope/impacts; secondary for implementation timing (but notes baseline “announced as 10 years”).
- Employment Law Worldview (Dec 8, 2025)  
  Professional commentary for employers; credible but earlier and somewhat speculative; notably suggests “summer 2026 onwards” (timing risk vs the April 2026 claim).
- VisaHQ aggregator citing Law Society + “final rules in April 2026” (Feb 12, 2026)  
  Mixed quality: VisaHQ itself is not primary, but Law Society is identifiable; “aims to publish final rules in April” is plausible but should be treated as secondhand unless directly sourced.
- Jobbatical (undated/secondary HR advisory)  
  Commercial and seems overconfident (“now in force” phrasing). Useful as a signal of expectations, weak for facts.
- AskNews items (Sun, Birmingham Mail, Tablet, etc.; Feb 18–20, 2026)  
  Mostly reportage/opinion about related reforms and criticism. The Tablet (specialist) is reasonable for stakeholder reaction; The Sun is weak. These don’t strongly confirm *legal commencement* timing.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (big weight)
- Institutional/procedural: UK can change Immigration Rules via Home Office “Statements of Changes” with relatively low parliamentary friction (negative procedure norms). This structurally enables fast implementation.  
- Multiple primary signals of firm intent + date: Hansard + GOV.UK consultation/news all point to **April 2026** as the target for the earned settlement model including **10-year baseline**.

Moderate evidence (medium weight)
- Consultation has closed (mid-Feb 2026): reduces one major uncertainty; the system is now in the “draft + lay rules” phase, consistent with imminent action.  
- Practitioner/employer ecosystem behaving as if April is real (law firm/HR guidance, “rush applications” narrative). This is an expectations proxy, not proof.

Weak evidence (small weight)
- Tabloid/aggregator coverage and advocacy-group reactions: indicate political salience and controversy, but are noisy on exact legal start dates.

Key countervailing considerations / “No” pathways
- Timing slippage risk is unusually consequential here: even a modest delay (e.g., to mid/late May or “summer”) flips the outcome to No.  
- Complexity/controversy (retroactivity, Equality Act / legitimate expectation concerns, transitional protections) could motivate delay or a phased start.  
- Fine-print ambiguities could matter at resolution:  
  • If the reform is *prospective-only* (affecting only future arrivals), it might not “affect at least some applicants” before May 2026.  
  • The “majority of grants YE Sep 2025” clause could interact awkwardly with EUSS settled status statistics; if EUSS is treated as within scope, the “majority” baseline might remain effectively 5 years. (I think the *intended* scope is ILR routes, but this is a real resolution-risk.)

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time left: ~70 days (Feb 20 → May 1, 2026).  
- If the remaining time were halved (~35 days), I’d downgrade materially because drafting/laying/commencement would have to be almost immediate (probability perhaps ~35–45%).  
- If doubled (~140 days, into early July), I’d upgrade because “summer 2026” implementation would then still count (probability perhaps ~75–85%).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view base rate)
Outside-view base rate provided: 68% Yes.

Adjustments:
- Upward: Consultation now closed and multiple *primary* government signals remain consistent with April 2026 (+3 to +6).  
- Downward: Deadline is tight and a single-cycle slippage (legal/political/transitional complexity) breaks the question; plus fine-print ambiguity about “affecting applicants” and “majority of grants” (−6 to −10).

Net: modest downward from 68% to low-60s feels appropriate: strong intent + enabling procedure, but the “must be in force by May 1” requirement is a brittle threshold.

Probability calibration
- Status quo if nothing changes: baseline stays 5 years ⇒ No.  
- I’m effectively asking: “How likely is it that the government actually *commences* a 10-year baseline (for the main ILR baseline) on/around April 2026 rather than slipping beyond May 1, or structuring it so it doesn’t affect any applicants pre-May?”

My inside-view probability: 62%.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: By May 1, 2026, are rules **in force** making the **baseline** ILR settlement qualifying period **≥10 years** (affecting some applicants)?  
2) Outside view base rate: 68%.  
3) Consistency: 62 out of 100 times, the UK has a ≥10-year baseline in force before May 1, 2026.  
4) Top evidence (3–5):
   - Hansard + GOV.UK: explicit April 2026 implementation intent for 10-year baseline.  
   - Immigration Rules can be changed relatively quickly (low structural barriers).  
   - Consultation closed Feb 2026 → action phase now.  
   - High complexity/controversy raises delay/phasing risk.  
   - Fine-print ambiguity (prospective-only / “affect applicants”, majority-of-grants/EUSS interaction).  
5) Blind spot: Government lays/commences rules in April but designs transition so no “applicants” are affected pre-May (or resolution treats EUSS-majority as decisive), making a “Yes-looking” policy still resolve No → would push probability down ~10–20 pts if that interpretation dominates.  
6) Status quo nudge: Given the brittleness of the May 1 cutoff, a slight pull toward No is warranted.

Probability: 62%
