Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, and what’s factual vs opinion)

1) **UK Home Office Immigration System Statistics (YE Sep 2025)**  
- **What it says (facts):** In YE Sep 2025 there were **491,453 total “indefinite leave” grants**, of which **67% were EUSS settled status** and **32% were non‑EUSS settlement grants**. It also notes the Home Office opened an “earned settlement” consultation in Nov 2025 and that the baseline was still **5 years** under most non‑EUSS routes as of that statistical period.  
- **Quality/date:** High quality (official stats), relevant for the fine print about “majority of grants.”  
- **Opinion vs fact:** Essentially all factual.

2) **GOV.UK ILR eligibility page**  
- **What it says (facts):** Current “usual” rule is **5 years** for many categories; long residence route is **10 years** already. No mention of the new proposal.  
- **Quality/date:** High quality for current law; not forward-looking.  
- **Opinion vs fact:** Factual.

3) **Home Office consultation: “A Fairer Pathway to Settlement / Earned Settlement” (Nov 2025)**  
- **What it says (facts/policy intent):** States the government has “already announced” lifting the “starting point” to **10 years** and consults on surrounding details. Indicates intent to implement via **Immigration Rules** changes (not primary legislation) and discusses possible accelerators/penalties and some routes being out of scope (notably **EUSS**).  
- **Quality/date:** Very high for government intent and proposed design; it is **not itself** the legal change.  
- **Opinion vs fact:** It mixes factual background stats with policy argumentation; the key signal is **stated government intent** and the (typical) legal vehicle.

4) **Gallup (Feb 2026) on public concern about immigration**  
- **What it says (facts):** 21% cite immigration as the biggest problem; breakdown by party.  
- **Quality/date:** High quality polling; indirect relevance (political pressure).  
- **Opinion vs fact:** Mostly descriptive statistics with some interpretive framing.

5) **IPPR analysis (think tank)**  
- **What it says:** Estimates affected population; argues for “legacy clause”/grandfathering; highlights child impacts.  
- **Quality/date:** Medium—useful as advocacy + some empirical estimates; left-leaning and normatively framed.  
- **Opinion vs fact:** Both; estimates may be informative, but recommendations are opinion.

6) **Jobbatical blog**  
- **What it says:** Claims implementation “now in force” from April 2026, plus operational implications.  
- **Quality/date:** Low-to-medium. It’s a commercial secondary source and appears to **overstate certainty** (April 2026 was still future as of question open).  
- **Opinion vs fact:** Mixed; treat as interpretation, not dispositive.

7) **UK in a Changing Europe (Feb 2026)**  
- **What it says:** Commentary/analysis of likely effects, including retrospective application issues.  
- **Quality/date:** Medium. More analytical than authoritative for what will happen.  
- **Opinion vs fact:** Substantial opinion/interpretation.

8) **Law firm / immigration practitioner writeups (Morgan Lewis; Erickson Immigration Group)**  
- **What they say (facts + practitioner inference):** Consultation closed Feb 12 2026; implementation targeted **April 2026**; likely delivered by **Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules** (negative procedure).  
- **Quality/date:** Medium-to-high on process mechanics; they are careful but still extrapolating.  
- **Opinion vs fact:** Some forward-looking advice; the procedural description is generally reliable.

9) **Agent report (synthesis through mid-Feb 2026)**  
- **What it says (facts as of then):** Consultation closed; **no Statement of Changes** or SIs yet laid; negative resolution procedure; key watch item is publication in late Feb–Mar for April commencement.  
- **Quality/date:** Medium—useful synthesis, but depends on completeness/accuracy of the agent’s scan. I’d treat “no draft Rules yet” as plausible but still something to verify independently.

**Key takeaway from sources for an outside view baseline:** Government intent is explicit, but (as of mid-Feb 2026) the binding legal step (Immigration Rules change) is not yet observed in these materials; and the timeline is tight.

### (b) Reference class analysis (possible classes and suitability)

**Reference class 1: UK Immigration Rules changes announced with a target go-live date ~4–6 months later**  
- **Why suitable:** This reform is expected to be implemented largely via Immigration Rules (secondary legislation-like), which the UK government updates frequently.  
- **What base rate would look like:** A high fraction of announced Immigration Rules packages do go live roughly on schedule, but not all—some slip, are staged, or get partially revised.

**Reference class 2: High-salience immigration tightening proposals after consultation**  
- **Why suitable:** This is politically salient, linked to public concern and migration levels. Such proposals often proceed, but can be moderated by backlash, operational feasibility, or legal risk (especially retroactivity).

**Reference class 3 (edge-case): Changes that would require revising treaty-constrained schemes (e.g., EUSS)**  
- **Why it matters:** The fine print references “majority of grants in YE Sep 2025,” which are **EUSS**; EUSS is widely understood to be constrained by the UK–EU Withdrawal Agreement.  
- **Suitability:** Only relevant if the resolution interprets “majority of grants” literally including EUSS for the baseline test. If so, “Yes” becomes extremely unlikely. If not, ignore this class.

**Most suitable (for a normal-policy outside view):** Reference class 1 + 2 (Immigration Rules tightening packages).  
**But:** I flag genuine ambiguity in the fine print due to EUSS dominating “grants.”

### (c) Timeframe analysis (how long left + what that implies)

- **Today:** 2026-02-20  
- **Resolution cutoff:** before **2026-05-01**  
- **Time left:** ~**10 weeks**.

For Immigration Rules, a common procedural constraint is the **“21 days”** convention: Rules are typically laid ~21 days before they take effect (though governments can sometimes move faster with justification). If the government aims for **early-to-mid April 2026** commencement, the critical window for laying changes is roughly **early-to-mid March 2026**.

Historically, UK immigration policy changes often cluster around **April** (new financial year; fee changes; operational rollouts). So April 2026 is a plausible “typical” implementation point—*but* a 10-week runway is short, and slippage of even 3–6 weeks would push beyond May 1.

### (d) Justification (outside view synthesis)

**Status quo if nothing changes:** Baseline remains **5 years** for most non‑EUSS routes.

**What must happen for “Yes”:**  
- A legally operative change (Immigration Rules, and possibly related instruments) must **take effect** before May 1, 2026, setting the **baseline** qualifying period to **≥10 years** for the relevant majority category under the fine print.

**Outside-view forces pushing toward implementation:**
- UK governments can and do change Immigration Rules relatively quickly compared with primary legislation.
- Immigration is politically salient; “doing something” by April fits recurring UK policy cadence.
- Consultation has already closed (Feb 12), suggesting the process is designed for a fast turn.

**Outside-view forces pushing toward delay / non-occurrence by May 1:**
- The policy is administratively complex (earned settlement modifiers, dependants, interaction with many routes); complex packages have higher slippage risk.
- Potential legal-risk management (especially transitional arrangements / retrospective application) can force redesign or phased rollouts.
- The window is narrow: missing an April go-live likely means missing the May 1 cutoff.

**Ambiguity risk (fine print / EUSS):**  
Because YE Sep 2025 “majority of grants” are EUSS, and EUSS is described as out of scope in the consultation, a strict reading could make “Yes” require changing EUSS as well (very unlikely). I cannot resolve that ambiguity from the provided text alone; it materially affects the base rate.

---

Outside view calibration:

- **Baseline (reference class: Immigration Rules packages with stated implementation dates):** I’d put “implemented roughly on schedule” in the **~70–85%** band when the government is clearly committed and the vehicle is Immigration Rules.  
- **Adjustments for short runway + complexity:** subtract ~10–20 points for (i) only ~10 weeks left and (ii) policy complexity + legal/transitional design risks. That yields roughly **55–75%** *if the resolution is effectively about non‑EUSS ILR routes*.  
- **Upset rate in this domain:** Delays and partial rewrites are common enough that I don’t want to go above ~80% with such a tight deadline, even with strong stated intent.

**Ambiguity overlay:** If the resolution really hinges on the “majority of grants” including EUSS, then “Yes” would drop to **low single digits**. Lacking clarity, my outside view splits the difference but still leans toward the “normal” interpretation (that the question is about the standard ILR baseline for the main non‑EUSS system).
