Analysis:

1. Source analysis (key items only)
• Home Office consultation paper “A Fairer Pathway to Settlement” (Nov 2025, government primary source). Fact: intent to lift the baseline qualifying period for settlement to 10 years for most routes; EUSS, BN(O) and family routes explicitly remain on the 5-year track. High reliability, policy still prospective.  
• GOV.UK press release “Biggest overhaul of legal migration in 50 years” (Dec 2025, primary). Re-states the 10-year baseline ambition, implementation “from April 2026”. High reliability on intention, not on timing certainty.  
• Immigration statistics YE Sept 2025 (Home Office). Fact: 491 k ILR grants; 67 % were under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS). High reliability and critical for the fine-print “majority of grants” clause.  
• UK-in-a-Changing-Europe commentary (Feb 2026, academic think-tank). Analysis/opinion on likely effects; confirms that EUSS is excluded. Moderate reliability, secondary.  
• Visa-sector newsletters / law-firm blogs (Dec 2025–Feb 2026). Consistent message: consultation closed 12 Feb 2026; Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (SoCIR) expected late Feb–Mar with go-live early April. Moderate reliability on process, not decisive evidence of enactment.

2. Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong:  
• Government’s declared policy and repeated public commitment to the 10-year baseline (two independent primary sources).  
Moderate:  
• Negative procedure for Immigration Rules means legal change could be passed in days once drafted; April start is administratively plausible.  
Weak–Moderate (against):  
• Fine-print of the Metaculus question: outcome hinges on the “baseline for the majority of grants YE Sep 2025”. That majority (≈67 %) came via the EUSS which the government explicitly leaves on 5 years.  
• Only ten weeks remain; no draft SoCIR laid as of 20 Feb 2026, leaving little slack for legal or IT slippage.

3. Timeframe analysis  
• 74 days remain until the 1 May 2026 cut-off.  
• Halving (≈5 weeks): probability of a qualifying change drops sharply because SoCIR would have to appear almost immediately.  
• Doubling (≈20 weeks): probability would rise because even a July slippage would still beat the longer window (but that lies outside the actual resolution period).

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (general Immigration Rules packages implemented on schedule after consultation): 67 %.  
Adjust downward:  
a) −20 pp for the “majority-of-grants” clause: even if the 10-year rule is enacted it will not cover EUSS, so the question would still resolve No.  
b) −10 pp for operational / legal risk of missing the April target.  
c) +5 pp for strong political salience and ease of secondary-legislation route.  
Net inside-view ≈ 42 %.  
But clause (a) is essentially binary: if the interpretation stands, probability collapses toward 0 %; if authors really meant “baseline for most work-route migrants” it stays near 42 %. I assign 80 % weight to the literal reading, 20 % to the looser reading:

Final probability = 0.8 × 7 % (late renegotiation or error overturns exclusion) + 0.2 × 42 % ≈ 12 %.

5. Status-quo outcome  
If nothing further happens the baseline remains 5 years and the question resolves No.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Before 1 May 2026 will UK law make 10 years the baseline residence period for ILR for the cohort that formed the majority of ILR grants (YE Sep 2025)?”  
2. Outside base-rate used = 67 %.  
3. Consistency: “In roughly 12 out of 100 similar timelines the qualifying period becomes ≥10 years for that majority before 1 May 2026.”  
4. Key evidence:  
 • Gov’t intent & April target announced.  
 • Immigration Rules can be changed quickly.  
 • EUSS made up 67 % of ILR grants and is excluded.  
 • No Statement of Changes laid as of 20 Feb 2026.  
 • Only ten weeks remain.  
5. Blind-spot: Ministers unexpectedly extend the 10-year rule to EUSS via emergency legislation, overriding Withdrawal Agreement; would make my forecast far too low.  
6. Status-quo bias considered: maintains baseline at 5 years.

Probability calibration
The main risk to a “No” resolution is an interpretive quirk or a highly ambitious legal manoeuvre extending the rule to EUSS or redefining the “majority” category. Assigning 12 % to that compound scenario feels proportionate given the tight timeline and treaty constraints.

Probability: 12%
