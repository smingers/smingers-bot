Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, reliability first)
   • GOV.UK news release “Biggest overhaul of legal migration model” (official, Jan-2026): primary, fact-level description of policy.  
   • Hansard, 20-Nov-2025: Home Secretary confirms “changes will come into effect in April 2026”.  Primary, verbatim parliamentary record.  
   • “A Fairer Pathway to Settlement” consultation paper (Home Office, Nov-2025): primary, sets a 10-year baseline and a February-2026 close date.  
   • VisaHQ / Law-Society piece (12-Feb-2026): secondary but quotes Home Office press office; states analysis period “~6 weeks” and goal of publishing final rules “in April 2026”.  
   • UK-in-a-Changing-Europe article (13-Feb-2026) & Jobbatical briefing (Feb-2026): tertiary analysis; both treat April-2026 start as given.  
   • Employment-Law-Worldview blog (Dec-2025): good practitioner source but less current; expects “summer 2026” commencement – a note of potential slippage.  
   • Media/op-ed items (The Sun, Birmingham Live, etc. Feb-2026): echo policy and political pressure; largely opinion, little new fact.

2. Evidence analysis  
   Strong evidence (+):  
     – Multiple independent primary sources (GOV.UK, Hansard, consultation paper) already state the policy and the April-2026 start date.  
     – Immigration Rules are secondary legislation subject to the negative procedure; historically 8/10 such changes began within six months of consultation close.  
     – Labour enjoys a working majority; no Commons vote is required.

   Moderate evidence (±):  
     – Consultation closed only a week ago; Home Office pledges a six-week analysis window—tight but feasible.  
     – Employers’, Law-Society, refugee-sector push-back could motivate transitional delays.

   Weak evidence (–):  
     – Blog speculation of “summer 2026” implementation; single source, pre-consultation.  
     – Threat of judicial review; Rules would still “come into effect” before any stay.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • 71 days remain until the 1-May-2026 deadline.  
   • Typical lag between tabling a Statement of Changes and commencement: 21–40 days.  
   • If the window were halved (≈35 d), probability would fall ~20 pp because drafting & laying the SI would be almost unprecedentedly rushed.  
   • If doubled (≈140 d), probability would rise ~10 pp—ample room to iron out transitional details.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustments  
   Outside-view base rate (major Immigration-Rules change implemented within 6 mo of consultation): 68 %.  
   Up-adjustments  
     +5 pp  Repeated, on-record ministerial commitment to an April-2026 start.  
     +3 pp  Negative-procedure SI requires no parliamentary time; opposition cannot filibuster.  
   Down-adjustments  
     –3 pp  Extremely compressed post-consultation drafting calendar.  
     –2 pp  Possibility Home Office offers phased commencement after listening to stakeholders.  
   Net inside-view probability = 68 + 5 + 3 – 3 – 2 = 71 %.

5. Sub-factor pathways  
   • YES path (≈71 %): Consultation responses digested on schedule → Statement of Changes laid late-March → Rules commence 22-April-2026 alongside new tax year.  
   • NO path (≈29 %): Home Office announces phased start date “1 July 2026” or later; or Cabinet decides on further study/soften due to backlash; or baseline raised only for minority categories leaving majority on 5-year route.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 71 times out of 100, the baseline settlement period will legally become 10 years for the majority of ILR applicants on or before 1 May 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between now and 1 May 2026 will UK Immigration Rules set 10-year baseline ILR qualifying period for most applicants?”  
2. Base rate recorded as 68 %.  
3. Consistency line written above.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   • Hansard: minister says April-2026 start.  
   • GOV.UK press release already announcing 10-year baseline.  
   • Consultation closed 13-Feb-2026, six-week analysis target.  
   • Immigration Rules negative procedure—swift historical precedent.  
   • Practitioner note hints possible summer delay.  
5. Blind-spot: Home Office quietly opts for phased commencement starting 1 June 2026—misses resolution window. Would flip outcome.  
6. Status-quo inertia favours five-year rule; I consciously resisted a further nudge toward “No”.

Probability: 71%
