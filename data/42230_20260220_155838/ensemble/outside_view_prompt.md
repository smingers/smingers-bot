You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the UK increase the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years before May 2026?

Question background:
Immigrants to the UK can currently apply for permanent residency – or "indefinite leave to remain" – after living in the country [for 5 years under most visa categories](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain#:~:text=You%20must%20usually%20have%20lived%20and%20worked%20in%20the%20UK%20for%205%20years).

Shabana Mahmood, the Home Secretary, has proposed a change to the requirements to apply for this status; the core changes proposed include increasing [the baseline requirement to 10 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#:~:text=a\)%20increasing%20the%20baseline%20qualifying%20period%20for%20settlement%20to%2010%20years) while also introducing modifying factors which may increase or reduce this period.

This change is driven by [forecasts of record high applications](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#future-settlement-forecast) for residency over the next five years and a backdrop of [21% of British people polled](https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx) considering immigration to be Britain's "biggest national problem".

In November 2025, Mahmood indicated that the changes would come into effect [in April 2026.](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-11-20/debates/E3CE324D-7597-40C5-8697-DB48AA843CFC/MigrationSettlementPathway#contribution-44475956-0A57-466A-A4EA-7A7FD64AAD83)

`{"format":"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period","info":{"post_id":42135,"question_id":41903}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before May 1, 2026, the baseline qualifying period for settlement (permanent residency) in the UK is 10 or more years.

Additional fine-print:
To qualify a change must affect at least some applicants for permanent residency before May 2026. If a change is announced, but does not come in to effect before May 1, 2026, it will not be sufficient to resolve this question.

This question will not consider any modifications that change the residency requirement; only the baseline requirement will matter for this question.

If the baseline requirement is increased for some visa categories but not others, this question will resolve according to how the new baseline would have applied to the majority of grants in [the year ending September 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-september-2025/how-many-indefinite-leave-settlement-and-euss-settled-status-and-citizenship-grants-have-been-issued-in-the-uk#s-2).

## Summary: UK Indefinite Leave, Settlement, and Citizenship Grants (Year Ending September 2025)

### Key Context
- The Home Office opened a **public consultation ("A Fairer Pathway to Settlement")** in November 2025, proposing to reform current settlement rules, open for a 12-week period.
- Current rules: Most settlement grants require **5 years** qualifying period (work/family routes); **10 years** under the long residence route.

---

### Total Indefinite Leave Grants (Year Ending September 2025)
- **491,453 total grants** of indefinite leave, broken down as:
  - **67% (330,745)**: EUSS settled status grants
  - **32% (158,137)**: Settlement grants under other immigration routes
  - **<1% (2,571)**: Immediate settlement grants

---

### Settlement Grants (Non-EUSS) — Section 2
- **158,137 total settlement grants**, a **6% increase** from the prior year
- By category:
  - **Work-related**: 59,642 (+11%), with Skilled Worker route comprising ~75% of these; Skilled Worker grants specifically rose 5% to 43,373
  - **Family-related**: 43,942 (+5%), mostly former Partner visa holders
  - **Refugee/protection**: 35,725 (-2%), still over double 2019 volumes; ~90% of refugees granted since 2007 achieve settlement within 10 years
  - **Other (Long Residence, Private Life, BN(O), discretionary)**: 18,828 (+15%), highest since 2022; most via the **Long Residence route**

---

### EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) — Section 3
- **330,745 EUSS settled status grants** in the latest year, down 5% from prior year
- Since scheme launch (2018): **4.3 million settled status grants** total; two-thirds issued before the June 30, 2021 deadline
- As of September 2025: ~**1.5 million** people still held pre-settled status
- From **January 2025**, some pre-settled status holders can be **automatically upgraded** to settled status without a new application; ~53,750 have been automatically granted settled status since introduction
- Repeat applications (pre-settled → settled transitions): 237,750, down ~25% year-on-year, partly due to automation

---

### Citizenship Grants
- **240,613 grants of British citizenship** in the latest year, **10% fewer** than the prior year, but higher than any of the preceding 13 years
- **Naturalisation grants**: 171,859, nearly double the figure from 5 years prior (95,440)

---

### Relevance to the Forecasting Question
The article confirms that the **baseline qualifying period remains 5 years** for most routes as of the year ending September 2025, with 10 years applying only to the Long Residence route. The consultation on increasing the baseline to 10 years was **open** (not yet enacted) as of the article's publication. The data on grant volumes by category would be relevant to the fine print condition about which visa categories represent the **majority of grants**.

## Summary: UK Indefinite Leave to Remain – GOV.UK

**Note:** This is a general informational page from GOV.UK about eligibility for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). The content appears to reflect the **current rules** and does not reference any proposed changes to the qualifying period.

### Key Facts from the Article:

**Standard Qualifying Periods (Current Rules):**
- **Most work visas:** 5 years of living and working in the UK
- **Tier 1 visa:** 2 or 3 years (depending on type)
- **Innovator Founder or Global Talent visa:** 3 years
- **UK Ancestry visa:** 5 years
- **Long residence route:** 10 years or more of continuous residence (this is an *existing* separate pathway, not a new proposal)

**Other Routes to ILR:**
- Family members of British citizens or those with ILR (route varies by visa type)
- EU/EEA/Swiss citizens may apply under the **EU Settlement Scheme** for settled status instead
- Some Commonwealth citizens may have **right of abode**
- Windrush scheme eligibility for some individuals

**What ILR Provides:**
- Right to live, work, and study in the UK indefinitely
- Eligibility to apply for benefits (if otherwise eligible)
- Pathway to apply for **British citizenship**

The article makes **no mention** of the proposed increase to a 10-year baseline qualifying period under the new "earned settlement" consultation.

## Summary: "A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" – UK Government Consultation (November 2025)

### Source & Context
This is an official UK Government consultation document (CP 1448), presented to Parliament by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in November 2025, outlining proposed reforms to the UK's settlement (indefinite leave to remain) system.

---

### Core Proposal
The government has **already announced** (described as a done decision, not merely proposed) that the baseline qualifying period for settlement will be **increased from 5 years to 10 years**. The consultation concerns the *conditions* under which settlement can be earned, not whether the 10-year baseline will be implemented.

---

### Key Facts & Statistics

- **Net migration 2021–2024**: approximately 2.6 million people (~1 in 30 current UK residents arrived in this four-year period)
- **Health and Care visa arrivals 2022–2024**: 616,000 individuals (over half were dependants, not workers)
- **Forecast settlement grants 2026–2030**: ~1.6 million people, peaking at ~450,000 per year in 2028
- **Current baseline**: 5 years for most visa categories; criminal sentence threshold of over 1 year

---

### Proposed "Earned Settlement" Framework

The new model is built on **four core pillars**:
1. **Character** – Clean criminal record required (no ability to offset); full review of criminality thresholds underway
2. **Integration** – Demonstrated meaningful engagement with British society
3. **Contribution** – Sustained, measurable economic contribution
4. **Residence** – Lawful, continuous residence (residence alone will not normally qualify)

### Time Adjustment Model
- **Baseline**: 10 years (up from 5)
- **Accelerated settlement** possible for: high-talent/high-taxpaying individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers
- **Faster settlement** (not subject to consultation): spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong
- **Delayed settlement** for: benefit claimants, those who entered the UK illegally (20-year path for refugees on "core protection" support)

---

### Additional Consultation Options
The document consults on three specific options to reduce forecast settlement volumes:
- **(a)** Increasing baseline qualifying period to **10 years**
- **(b)** Increasing qualifying period to **15 years** for Skilled Workers in roles below RQF Level 6 (below bachelor's degree level)
- **(c)** Implementing a **No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF)** condition at settlement

A **separate 15-year baseline** is proposed specifically for lower-wage Health and Care visa migrants who bring non-working dependants.

---

### Retroactivity
The government proposes applying these changes to **all current migrants who have not yet received indefinite leave to remain** — meaning those currently on track for settlement under the old 5-year rule would be subject to the new requirements once immigration rules change. Those who **already hold** settled status are explicitly excluded from any changes.

---

### Scope Exclusions
- EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) – out of scope
- Windrush Scheme grants – out of scope
- Those already holding settled status – out of scope

---

### Notable Quote (Home Secretary Mahmood)
> *"This government has already announced that we will lift the starting point at which most people can receive indefinite leave to remain to ten years."*

This framing suggests the 10-year baseline is a **confirmed policy decision**, with the consultation focused on the surrounding conditions rather than the baseline itself.

## Summary: "A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" – UK Government Consultation (November 2025)

### Source & Context
This is an official UK Government consultation document (CP 1448), presented to Parliament by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in November 2025, outlining proposed reforms to the UK's settlement (indefinite leave to remain) system.

---

### Core Proposed Changes

**Baseline Qualifying Period:**
- The government proposes **increasing the standard qualifying period for settlement from 5 years to 10 years** for most applicants.
- A separate, more stringent **15-year baseline** is proposed for lower-skilled/lower-wage migrants, specifically those who arrived on the Health and Care visa route.

**Mandatory Requirements (non-negotiable):**
- Clean criminal record (a "root and branch review" of criminality thresholds is planned)
- High standard of English
- Sustained and measurable economic contribution
- No debt in the UK

**"Time Adjustment" Model (Earned Settlement):**
The system is built on four pillars — **Character, Integration, Contribution, and Residence** — with modifying factors that can increase or decrease the 10-year baseline:
- *Reductions* available for: high-talent/high-taxpayer individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers, spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong
- *Extensions* applied to: those who have claimed benefits, those who entered the country illegally (a "long penalty" proposed); refugees on "core protection" support face a 20-year path
- Benefits access proposed to be restricted to those with British citizenship rather than settled status

---

### Scope & Exclusions
- **Out of scope:** EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) holders, Windrush Scheme grants, those who already hold settled status
- **Crucially**, the document states the changes would apply to **everyone currently in the UK who has not yet received indefinite leave to remain**, including those who would otherwise have qualified under the old 5-year rule in the near future

---

### Rationale Cited
- **Forecast settlement volumes:** ~1.6 million people expected to settle between 2026–2030, peaking at ~450,000 in 2028, driven largely by 2022–2024 immigration (especially Health and Care visas)
- **Net migration:** 2.6 million additional people between 2021–2024
- **Fiscal concerns:** Migrants on lower wages with non-working dependants are described as presenting "significant fiscal costs"
- **Social cohesion:** The document references public concern about immigration levels and the need to maintain public confidence in the immigration system

---

### Process
- The consultation runs for **12 weeks** from publication
- Following consultation, the government will set out its preferred option(s)
- The Home Secretary indicated (per background information) that changes would come into effect **in April 2026**

---

*Note: This document is a consultation paper, meaning the proposals are not yet enacted law. The final policy may differ from what is outlined here.*

<QuestionSource url="https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx">
## Summary: U.K. Leads World in Concern About Migration (Gallup, February 11, 2026)

### Key Statistics

- **21% of Britons** named immigration as their No. 1 national concern in 2025, statistically tied with the economy (23%)
- This makes the UK **the most concerned country globally** about immigration; the global median is just **1%** across 107 countries
- UK net migration fell sharply to an estimated **204,000** in the year ending June 2025, down from nearly **650,000** in the year ending June 2024
- The UK's foreign-born population (17%) is comparable to the US (15%), Norway (18%), and the Netherlands (16%), yet those countries show far lower immigration concern

### Political Breakdown (Gallup polling, 2025)

- **Reform UK supporters**: 48% cite immigration as the biggest problem — roughly twice the rate of any other major European party's supporters
- **Conservative supporters**: 23% cite immigration as top concern
- **Labour supporters**: 16% cite immigration as top concern
- **Non-aligned UK adults**: 25% cite immigration as top concern — roughly twice the next highest (Poland and Ireland at 13%)

### Key Predictors of Immigration Concern (Gallup Analysis)

After controlling for demographic and attitudinal factors, five key predictors were identified (though not explicitly listed in the extracted text). Notably, **gender, employment status, urban/rural location, personal wellbeing, and actual household income showed no statistically significant relationship** with immigration concern.

### Historical Acceptance vs. Current Concern

- Between 2016–2023, UK acceptance of migrants **grew gradually**: by 2023, 80% viewed immigrants as a good thing, 79% were comfortable with an immigrant neighbor, and 75% accepted an immigrant marrying a close relative
- Gallup suggests concern about immigration as a **national policy issue** can coexist with **personal acceptance of individual migrants**

### Political Implications

- Reform UK, despite holding few parliamentary seats, has been "setting the political weather" and attracting Conservative defections
- The findings highlight a "balancing act" for PM Keir Starmer, particularly with local elections on the near-term horizon
- Reform supporters' outsized focus on immigration could create headwinds for the current government if turnout is high

### Methodology

- Nationally representative samples of ~1,000 adults per country, aged 15+, across **107 countries and territories**
- Data collected **March–October 2025**
- Margin of sampling error: **±2.4 to ±4.7 percentage points** at the 95% confidence level

<Summary source="https://www.ippr.org/articles/far-from-settled-the-governments-earned-settlement-consultation">
## Summary: IPPR Analysis of UK "Earned Settlement" Consultation

**Source:** IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research) — a left-leaning UK think tank. This is a policy analysis/opinion piece, not a neutral news report.

---

### Core Policy Proposals Under Consultation

- The default qualifying period for settlement would **double from 5 to 10 years**
- Workers on below-graduate-level roles (including many care workers) would face a **default of 15 years**
- **Modifying factors** can shorten or lengthen the wait:
  - High English proficiency: **−1 year**
  - Earning £50,270+ for 3+ years: **−5 years**
  - Claiming benefits: **+5 to 10 years**
  - Overstaying a visa by 6+ months: **+20 years**

---

### Scale of Impact (IPPR Estimates)

- Approximately **1.35 million people already on routes to settlement** could face the longer default qualifying period
- Breakdown includes primarily **work route applicants and dependants, plus refugees**
- **23% (~309,000) are children**, mostly dependants on work routes
- Most common nationalities affected: **India, Nigeria, and Pakistan**
- BN(O) visa holders remain on a 5-year default but face new earnings requirements (£12,570+)

---

### IPPR's Key Concerns

1. **Retrospective application is unfair:** Migrants already on settlement routes arrived expecting a 5-year pathway; changing rules mid-journey imposes additional fees, uncertainty, and reduced job flexibility
2. **Incentive structure doesn't work retroactively:** People already in the UK couldn't have adjusted behavior based on rules that didn't exist when they arrived; prior benefit claims could now penalize them
3. **Child poverty risk:** Families on low-income work routes (especially former Health and Care route workers) would remain in poverty longer; 309,000 children face 10–15 year waits
4. **Moral consistency concern:** IPPR draws a parallel between retrospective application and Reform UK's proposal to revoke settled status, arguing the government needs "clear blue water" between the two positions

---

### IPPR's Recommendation

- The government should introduce a **"legacy clause" (grandfathering)** to protect the ~1.35 million people already on routes to settlement from the new rules
- New rules should apply **only to new entrants**, not those already partway through the settlement process

---

### Methodological Note

IPPR used the **Home Office's Migrant Journey dataset**, focusing on migrants with initial leave from 2021 onward who were still on settlement routes at end of 2024. The analysis covers only default qualifying periods and excludes temporary routes and BN(O) holders. The authors acknowledge data limitations.

## Summary: "A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" – UK Government Consultation Document (November 2025)

### Source & Context
This is an official UK Government consultation document (CP 1448), presented to Parliament by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in November 2025.

---

### Core Policy Announcement
The government has **already announced** (not merely proposed) that the baseline qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain (ILR/settlement) will be **increased from 5 years to 10 years** for most visa categories. The consultation document accompanies this announcement and seeks views on the specific conditions under which settlement can be "earned."

---

### Key Proposed Changes

**Mandatory baseline requirements** (non-negotiable to qualify at any point):
- Clean criminal record
- High standard of English
- Sustained and measurable economic contribution
- No outstanding debt in the UK

**Factors that could **reduce** the 10-year baseline:**
- High-talent/high-taxpayer status
- Senior public service roles
- Extensive community volunteering
- Spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong (not subject to consultation)

**Factors that could **extend** beyond 10 years:**
- Claiming benefits payments
- Illegal entry (described as a "long penalty")

**Special categories:**
- Refugees on "core protection" support: **20-year settlement path**
- Health and Care visa migrants (lower-wage, with non-working dependants): proposed **15-year baseline**
- Special consideration for children, armed forces members, and crime victims

---

### Retroactive Application
The government proposes applying these new rules to **all current migrants who have not yet received ILR**, including those who were already on track to qualify under the old 5-year rule. Those who have already been granted settled status will **not** be affected.

---

### Rights Upon Settlement
The consultation raises the question of whether **benefits access** should be reserved for British citizens rather than those with settled status.

---

### Stated Rationale
- Net migration of **2.6 million people between 2021–2024** (approximately 1 in 30 people currently in the UK)
- Criticism of the previous Conservative government's lowering of entry bars, particularly the Health and Care visa (intended for 6,000–40,000 jobs but resulted in 616,000 arrivals 2022–2024, over half being dependants)
- Concern about social division and public pressure on communities
- Framing settlement as a **"privilege to be earned, not a right"**

## Summary: UK ILR 10-Year Route Changes 2026 (Jobbatical)

**Note:** This article appears to be from a commercial HR/immigration services platform (Jobbatical). While it provides useful operational detail, it should be treated as a secondary source interpreting government policy rather than an official government source.

### Core Policy Changes
The article describes an "earned settlement" framework now in force, with **implementation from April 2026**:
- The **baseline qualifying period for ILR has increased to 10 years** for most migrants (up from 5 years on routes like Skilled Worker)
- The **flexible 10-year long residence route has been abolished** (previously allowed aggregating time across mixed visa categories)
- ILR is now "earned" based on contributions: economic input, English language (B2 level), compliance, and character

### Variable Qualifying Periods
- **10 years**: baseline for most migrants
- **Up to 15 years**: roles below RQF level 6 (e.g., some health and care roles)
- **3–5 years**: high earners (£50,270–£125,140+), top talent, specific public sector roles
- **20+ years**: cases involving benefit reliance, overstays, or other negative factors

### Policy Drivers
- Projected ~1.6 million ILR grants between 2026–2030 under old rules
- 2025 Immigration White Paper and "A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" consultation (closed February 2026)

### HR/Employer Implications
- Longer sponsorship periods required, raising retention, cost, and compliance challenges
- Rules reportedly apply **at the date of ILR application**, potentially affecting those already in the UK

<Summary source="https://ukandeu.ac.uk/remigration-by-stealth-the-governments-earned-settlement-proposals/">
## Summary: "Remigration by stealth? The government's earned settlement proposals"
**Source:** UK in a Changing Europe | **Date:** February 13, 2026 | **Author:** James Bowes (Space Management Assistant, Strategic Planning and Analytics, University of Warwick)

### Core Subject
This article analyzes the UK government's "earned settlement" consultation, which closed on February 13, 2026, examining its potential impact on both new and existing migrants seeking Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR).

---

### Key Proposed Changes Affecting All ILR Applicants
- English language requirement raised from **B1 to B2**
- Applicants must earn over **£12,570/year for at least three years**
- **Baseline qualifying period set at 10 years** (as announced)

### Tiered Qualifying Periods Under the Proposals
| Group | Qualifying Period |
|---|---|
| Family of British nationals, BNO holders, graduate-level jobs paying >£50,270 or eligible public sector roles | **5 years** (unchanged) |
| Earnings >£125,140 | **3 years** |
| Sub-graduate level work visa holders | **15 years** |
| Refugees | **20 years** |
| Illegal entrants, visa overstayers, visitor visa entrants | **30 years** |
| Global talent/innovator founder visa holders | **Unchanged** |

---

### Who Is Affected?
- Roughly **two-thirds** of those affected hold work visas or are dependants of work visa holders
- Most others are on family visas or are present for humanitarian reasons
- Notably, the article emphasizes these rules **will also affect over 2 million immigrants already living in the UK**, unlike previous immigration restrictions

### Impact on Work Visa Holders
- Approximately **half of main applicant work visa holders** face a 15-year wait (sub-graduate level jobs)
- Most **dependants** of even high-paid workers face at least a **10-year wait**, as dependants must independently meet the salary/occupation criteria to qualify for the 5-year pathway
- Most dependants of non-graduate workers likely face a **15-year wait**

### Risk of Forced Departure
The article argues many migrants will not simply face longer waits but will be **forced to leave entirely**, due to:
- Higher likelihood of redundancy over a 15-year visa period
- Employer reluctance to pay immigration skills charges for 15 years
- Cumulative visa fees and immigration health surcharge costs
- Expiry of lower salary thresholds (currently scheduled for **April 2030**) affecting pre-April 2024 skilled worker visa holders
- End of the **Immigration Salary List** (from January 2027, July 2028 for care workers), removing the 20% shortage occupation salary discount
- Restrictions tying workers to specific employers and occupations upon visa renewal

### Author's Conclusion
The article characterizes the proposals as potentially constituting "remigration by stealth," arguing that unless **far-reaching transitional protections** are introduced, many legal migrants who came under existing rules will be compelled to leave the UK — an outcome the government claims is not its objective.

<Summary source="https://eiglaw.com/uk-home-office-earned-settlement-consultation-released/">
## Summary: UK Home Office "Earned Settlement" Consultation Released (Erickson Immigration Group, Nov. 25, 2025)

### Key Facts & Timeline
- The UK Government opened its **"Earned Settlement" consultation** on November 25, 2025, with responses accepted until **February 12, 2026 at 11:59 PM**.
- The Home Secretary stated on **November 20, 2025** that the intention is to begin implementing changes in the **April 2026 statement of changes**.
- The proposals originated from the **Immigration White Paper** ("Restoring Control over the Immigration System"), published in **May 2025**.
- As of the article's publication date, **no rules have changed**; existing UK immigration rules remain in force.

### Proposed Settlement Qualifying Periods
| Category | Proposed Period |
|---|---|
| Most economic migrants (baseline) | **10 years** |
| Lower-paid workers (e.g., Health & Care) | 15 years |
| Migrants relying on benefits | 20 years |
| Recognized refugees | 20 years |
| Illegal migrants/overstayers | Up to 30 years |

### Fast-Track & Retained Routes
- **3 years**: High earners (>£125,000/year), Entrepreneurs, Global Talent, Innovator Founders
- **5 years**: NHS doctors/nurses; earners between £50,000–£125,000
- **5 years retained**: BN(O) holders and immediate family members of British citizens
- **Unaffected**: EU Settled Status holders

### Scope of Impact
- Proposals intended to apply to **approximately 2 million people** who arrived from **2021 onwards**.
- The government intends that anyone **not yet granted settlement** when the new model goes live will move to the new system — including those currently mid-pathway expecting 5-year eligibility.

### Additional Proposed Requirements
- Higher English language standards
- Clean criminal record requirements
- Integration expectations (e.g., volunteering)
- Potential restriction of benefits access until British Citizenship is obtained

### Employer/Sponsor Implications
- Sponsorship costs will likely **increase** for most, as longer qualifying periods extend sponsorship duration.

## Summary: Morgan Lewis – UK Earned Settlement Consultation (November 24, 2025)

### Core Announcement
On 20 November 2025, the UK government published a policy document proposing a shift to an **"earned settlement" system**, increasing the baseline residence period for settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain) from **5 years to 10 years** for most migrants. A public consultation was opened, closing **12 February 2026**, with implementation planned for **April 2026**.

---

### Proposed Baseline Periods
- **10 years**: Most migrants (up from 5 years)
- **15 years**: Health and Care visa holders; those in "medium-skilled" roles (below RQF level 6)
- **20 years**: Refugees on the "core protection" route
- **Unchanged at 5 years**: EU Settlement Scheme holders, family members of British citizens, BN(O) visa holders
- **Unchanged at 3 years**: Global Talent and Innovator Founder routes (accelerated pathways retained)

---

### Four Core Pillars
1. **Character** – Criminal record, immigration compliance, public good
2. **Integration** – Life in the UK test + English at B2 level (CEFR) or higher
3. **Contribution** – Minimum annual earnings above £12,570 for 3–5 years
4. **Residence** – Continuous lawful residence (no longer sole qualifying basis)

---

### Key Adjustments to Baseline

**Reductions:**
| Factor | Reduction |
|---|---|
| English at C1 level | −1 year |
| Income ≥£125,140 for 3 years | −7 years |
| Income ≥£50,270 for 3 years | −5 years |
| Public service employment (5 years) | −5 years |
| Community/volunteer work | −3 to 5 years |
| Parent/partner/child of British citizen | −5 years |
| BN(O) route holder | −5 years |
| Global Talent/Innovator Founder (3 years) | −7 years |

**Increases:**
| Factor | Addition |
|---|---|
| Public funds received <12 months | +5 years |
| Public funds received >12 months | +10 years |
| Illegal entry (e.g., small boat) | +up to 20 years |
| Entry on visit visa | +up to 20 years |
| Overstay ≥6 months | +up to 20 years |

---

### Dependants
Settlement periods for dependants will be assessed **independently** based on their own attributes, potentially resulting in different qualifying timelines than the main applicant. The consultation will address how children are accommodated given contribution-based requirements may be inappropriate for them.

---

### Implementation Timeline
- Consultation closed: **12 February 2026**
- Planned implementation: **April 2026**
- Rules expected to apply to **anyone not already holding settlement** at the date changes take effect
- Government consulting on **transitional arrangements** for those already on settlement pathways

---

### Employer Guidance Highlighted
The article advises employers to: engage with the consultation; identify employees currently eligible for settlement and **bring applications forward before April 2026**; review salary structures; budget for higher long-term sponsorship costs; and provide legal advice access to affected employees.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Trace legislative progress and current status of the UK Home Office “Earned Settlement” proposal that would increase the baseline qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain to ten years, including any published draft Immigration Rules, statutory instruments, or commencement orders scheduled before May 2026, plus analysis by immigration law firms and Hansard records up to February 2026.
1. Chronology and legislative vehicles to-date  
• 12 May 2025 – “Restoring Control over the Immigration System” White Paper presented to the Commons (Hansard, Immigration System debate, 12 May 2025).  The White Paper trailed replacement of the five-year residence norm with a default 10-year requirement and the abolition of the current 10-year “long residence” route.  
• 20 Nov 2025 – Written ministerial statement “Migration: Settlement Pathway” by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced a formal consultation, confirmed Government intent to begin implementation in April 2026, and indicated that most changes can be delivered by amending the Immigration Rules rather than primary legislation (KPMG summary; Hansard 20 Nov 2025).  
• 20 Nov 2025 – Home Office published “A Fairer Pathway to Settlement – Earned Settlement” consultation paper (closing 23:59 GMT, 12 Feb 2026).  The paper sets out the draft policy architecture, mandatory requirements, the 10-year baseline (15 years for below-RQF-6 roles, 20 years for most refugees) and the “time-adjustment” discounts/penalties (KPMG; All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration; Womble Bond Dickinson).  
• 12 Feb 2026 – Consultation closed.  Law Society, Free Movement and many sector bodies filed critical submissions on gender impact, retrospective application and business uncertainty (VisaHQ 5 Feb 2026; VisaHQ 12 Feb 2026).  
No draft Immigration Rules (normally laid as “Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules”, HC number) have yet been published, and no statutory instruments or commencement orders have been laid before either House.  The Home Office explicitly states that final Rules will be laid “after we have considered consultation responses” with a target “in time for April 2026 implementation” (consultation p. 3).  Consequently, as at 18 Feb 2026 the proposal remains at pre-legislative (consultation) stage.

2. Substance of the proposal likely to be converted into Immigration Rules  
Mandatory requirements (apply to every applicant)  
• Suitability: tightened criminality thresholds; no outstanding public debts.  
• Integration: English at B2 CEFR (up from B1) and Life in the UK Test.  
• Contribution: taxable earnings ≥ £12,570 for 3–5 years (subject to consultation).  
• Residence: lawful, continuous residence, but residence alone is no longer sufficient (APPG; Morgan Lewis).  

Baseline qualifying periods  
• 10 years – default for most economic migrants (Skilled Worker at RQF 6+; family routes).  
• 15 years – Skilled Workers in roles below RQF 6 and certain care-sector roles.  
• 20 years – refugees outside Government resettlement routes; plus penalties for benefit claimants.  
• Unaffected five-year routes – partners of British citizens, BN(O), Windrush, EUSS.  
• Accelerated three-year route retained for Global Talent and Innovator Founder (minus 7-year discount).  

Time-adjustment factors (only the biggest positive and negative applied):  
Reductions: taxable earnings £125,140 (-7 yrs) or £50,270 (-5 yrs); five years in specified public service (-5 yrs); high-level English C1 (-1 yr); verified volunteering (-3-5 yrs).  
Increases: receipt of public funds < 12 months (+5 yrs) or ≥ 12 months (+10 yrs); illegal arrival/visit-visa entry/overstay 6+ months (up to +20 yrs).  
(Full tables in APPG, KPMG and consultation.)

Dependants  
Each adult partner must qualify in their own right; timelines can diverge.  Children may either settle with parents during a “specific window” or transition to an individual pathway at 18 (Morgan Lewis).  

Transitional arrangements  
Government “preference” is none: anybody who has not obtained ILR by the commencement date would switch to the earned settlement regime (consultation p. 27).  Employers, law firms and NGOs argue this is unlawful or disproportionate and will trigger litigation (Lewis Silkin, “transitional arrangements”, 18 Dec 2025; IPPR 2026).  

3. Parliamentary scrutiny prospects 2026  
Because settlement rules sit in the Immigration Rules, changes are subject to the negative resolution procedure: they are laid at least 21 parliamentary days before coming into force and become law unless either House passes a motion to annul.  That procedure offers limited opportunity for amendment, but intensive political pressure could force revisions or phased transition.  If the Government chooses to adjust fees, an Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order—an affirmative statutory instrument—would also be required.  No such SI appears on the forthcoming business of either House up to 18 Feb 2026.  

4. Commentary from practitioners, think-tanks and employers  
• Business impact – sponsors face further four to ten years of visa fees, Immigration Skills Charge and IHS (≈ £10k–£14k per five-year extension) and retention risk (Lewis Silkin 18 Feb 2026; Womble Bond Dickinson example of Architect: £11,696 extra cost).  
• Labour-market concerns – care-sector and hospitality employers warn of intensified shortages as 15-year wait deters recruits (VisaHQ 5 Feb 2026).  
• Equality and discrimination – Free Movement and the Law Society highlight adverse impact on women (career breaks/part-time), disabled workers and low-paid groups; potential breach of Equality Act 2010 and Art. 14 ECHR (VisaHQ 5 Feb 2026; Law Society 12 Feb 2026).  
• Children and higher education – IPPR estimates 309,000 children already in the system would face longer waits, raising access-to-tuition-fee issues and family instability (IPPR “Far from settled”, Feb 2026).  
• Legitimate expectation litigation – lawyers note the 2009 HSMP Forum precedent and warn of judicial review if rules apply retrospectively (Lewis Silkin “transitional arrangements” 18 Dec 2025).  
• International competitiveness – tech, life-sciences and professional-services bodies say Canada and Australia are offering faster permanent residency, risking UK talent drain (VisaHQ 12 Feb 2026).

5. Current status vis-à-vis resolution question  
As of mid-February 2026:  
• The Government remains committed, on the record, to raising the baseline qualifying period from five to 10 years.  
• The measure has progressed from White Paper to consultation; no binding legislation has yet been laid.  
• Implementation is slated for “April 2026”, leaving little time for parliamentary scrutiny and for employers or migrants to lodge pre-change ILR applications.  
Therefore the qualifying period in law is still five years, but the pathway to a 10-year baseline is clearly advanced and on the Government’s forward programme.  The decisive events to watch are: (i) publication of a Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (likely numbered HC xxx of 2026) between late February and late March 2026; (ii) any associated Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2026; (iii) possible transitional provisions inserted into the Rules or a commencement order fixing the precise date (expected 6 April 2026 in line with the tax year).  

6. Information gaps  
• No draft Rules or statutory instruments yet available; details of precise wording, transitional clauses, fee levels and commencement date remain unknown.  
• No updated impact assessment published since the November 2025 statement.  
• No formal government response to consultation (due “within six weeks”, i.e., by late March 2026).  Until that response is published, final policy choices on earnings thresholds, volunteering criteria and below-RQF-6 treatment are unconfirmed.  

In sum, all publicly available evidence up to 18 February 2026 shows the “Earned Settlement” reform is on track but not yet enacted.  Parliament has not yet had the opportunity to vote on—or annul—the necessary Immigration Rules instrument, and key operational details, including transitional protection, could still shift in the next two months.</Agent_report>

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
