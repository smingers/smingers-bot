Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: EUSS and the "majority of grants" clause (MASSIVE impact)**
Forecaster 4 assigns only 12% probability, dramatically lower than all others (62-72%). The core reason is forecaster 4's interpretation that EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) grants constituted ~67% of all ILR grants in the year ending September 2025, and since the proposed 10-year rule would not apply to EUSS applicants (protected by the Withdrawal Agreement), the resolution criteria's "majority of grants" clause would cause the question to resolve No even if the policy is implemented on time. Forecasters 1, 2, 3, and 5 either don't consider this issue or implicitly assume the 10-year baseline would apply to the relevant majority of grants. This single interpretive/factual disagreement accounts for ~45-60 percentage points of spread.

**Disagreement 2: Timing risk — will implementation actually occur before May 1, 2026?**
Among the non-EUSS-focused forecasters, there's a modest spread (62-72%). Forecaster 3 is most pessimistic at 62%, citing complexity, phasing risk, and fine-print ambiguity. Forecasters 1, 2, and 5 cluster at 71-72%, emphasizing the strong ministerial commitment and the negative procedure mechanism. This accounts for ~10 percentage points of spread.

**Disagreement 3: Whether "affecting applicants" before May 1 is a meaningful hurdle**
Forecaster 3 raises the possibility that even if rules are laid, they could be structured so no applicants are actually affected before May 1 (e.g., prospective-only application). Others largely assume that laying the rules with an April commencement date would suffice.

Root Causes:

1. **EUSS majority-of-grants issue**: This is partly a **factual dispute** (what proportion of ILR grants in YE Sep 2025 were EUSS vs. non-EUSS?) and partly a **resolution criteria interpretation** dispute (does the "majority of grants" clause mean the 10-year rule must cover EUSS to resolve Yes?). The factual component — the actual breakdown of ILR grants — is verifiable.

2. **Timing risk**: This is primarily a **different weighting of the same evidence** — all forecasters acknowledge the April 2026 target and the tight timeline, but weight the delay risk differently. Some factual elements (whether a Statement of Changes has been laid, parliamentary recess dates) could help.

3. **"Affecting applicants" before May 1**: This is a **resolution criteria interpretation** issue combined with factual uncertainty about how the government would structure transitional provisions.
