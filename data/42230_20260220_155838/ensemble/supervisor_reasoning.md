Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (EUSS and "majority of grants" clause):** This was the most consequential disagreement. Forecaster 4 argued that EUSS grants constituted ~67% of all ILR grants in YE September 2025, meaning the 10-year rule wouldn't apply to the "majority" and the question would resolve No regardless of implementation timing.

The research partially addresses this but does not fully resolve it:
- The agent research confirmed that EUSS historically made up 88-93% of all ILR grants in YE June 2022 and YE June 2023.
- The GOV.UK EUSS statistics show ~335,321 EUSS settled status grants in YE June 2025.
- The exact Sett_02 table for YE September 2025 was not obtained.

However, I believe Forecaster 4's interpretation is likely **incorrect** for the following reasons:

1. The question's fine print says "this question will resolve according to how the new baseline would have applied to the **majority of grants**" — this is a counterfactual test. It asks how the new baseline *would have applied* to the majority, not whether it *does* apply. EUSS grants are made under a separate legal framework (Withdrawal Agreement) and don't have a "baseline qualifying period" in the same sense as standard ILR routes. The question is about the "baseline qualifying period for settlement" — EUSS operates under its own distinct scheme.

2. The question links to the statistics page about "how many indefinite leave settlement and EUSS settled status and citizenship grants have been issued." The resolution criteria reference this for determining which visa categories matter. But the proposed 10-year change is specifically about the standard settlement pathway. The question asks whether "the baseline qualifying period for settlement" is increased — EUSS has its own qualifying framework and is not typically described as having a "baseline qualifying period" in the same policy context.

3. Looking at the question's intent and the background information, it's clearly asking about the earned settlement proposal. The "majority of grants" clause appears designed to handle scenarios where the government raises the period for some work visa categories but not others — not to create a loophole via EUSS.

That said, there is genuine ambiguity, and Forecaster 4 raises a legitimate interpretive concern. I'd assign maybe 15-20% probability that this interpretation would cause a No resolution even if the policy is implemented on time.

**Disagreement 2 (Timing risk):** The research provides useful but mixed signals:
- Newland Chase (immigration law firm) states: "A Statement of Changes is expected to be laid before Parliament in **March 2026**" and "Implementation dates are expected to be **staggered starting April 2026**."
- Minister Mike Tapp confirmed on February 2, 2026 the government intends to proceed with doubling the qualifying period.
- Employment Law Worldview suggests "Summer 2026" implementation.
- Mishcon de Reya uses cautious language: "Changes **may** be introduced from April 2026."
- The consultation received ~130,000 responses, which is enormous and could slow processing.

The evidence is mixed but leans toward April 2026 being the target with real risk of slippage. The Statement of Changes expected in March 2026 would need to be laid with enough lead time before May 1. The "staggered starting April 2026" language from Newland Chase is particularly relevant — it suggests some changes could begin in April even if full implementation takes longer.

**Disagreement 3 ("Affecting applicants" before May 1):** The research shows the government plans to "roll out changes from spring 2026" and that transitional arrangements are still under review. The "staggered" implementation language suggests some applicants could be affected before May 1, but this remains uncertain.

Updated Analysis:

The EUSS interpretation issue raised by Forecaster 4 is creative but likely incorrect based on a reasonable reading of the question's intent and structure. I'd discount this concern significantly but not entirely (15-20% chance it matters).

For the core timing question, the evidence supports a probability in the 65-72% range that the 10-year baseline will be in effect before May 1, 2026. The March Statement of Changes timeline from Newland Chase is encouraging, but 130,000 consultation responses, the "staggered" language, and the "Summer 2026" estimate from Employment Law Worldview introduce meaningful delay risk.

Combining: ~70% base probability for timely implementation × ~82% probability that the EUSS interpretation doesn't block resolution = ~57%. But I think the EUSS blocking probability is lower than 18% — more like 10-12% — giving ~62-63%.

The weighted average of 57.8% is somewhat pulled down by Forecaster 4's 12% estimate. Given that the EUSS interpretation is likely incorrect but not certainly so, and the timing evidence is moderately positive, I'd adjust upward modestly.

Confidence: MEDIUM

Probability: 65%
