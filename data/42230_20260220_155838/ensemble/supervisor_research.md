## Summary: Free Movement Article on Immigration Statistics and Earned Settlement Proposals (November 27, 2025)

**Note:** The article appears to be truncated at the end, so some sections may be incomplete.

### Key Statistics from Year Ending September 2025

**Asylum System:**
- Initial decision backlog: 62,171 applications (80,841 people), down 36% year-on-year
- 13% year-on-year increase in asylum claims
- Asylum grant rate dropped from 54% (year ending Sept 2024) to 45% (year ending Sept 2025)
- 17% increase in immigration detention entries (22,661 total); 22% increase in enforced returns

**Country-Specific Asylum Outcomes:**
- **Syrians:** Only 5 grants of protection status in 2025; 26 refusals
- **Ukrainians:** Grants dropped from 31 to 27; refusals surged from 1 to 792, despite UNHCR stating no part of Ukraine is safe
- **Afghans:** Grant rate fell to 36%; 7,621 refusals vs. 1,235 the previous year, despite no viable forced return route

**Family Routes:**
- Partner/family visa grants fell 22% to 67,537

### Relevance to Earned Settlement Proposals

The article highlights **significant data gaps** in Home Office reporting that are particularly concerning given the proposed earned settlement changes (which would increase the baseline qualifying period to 10 years):

1. **No breakdown** of how many people have been pushed into the 10-year family route (vs. 5-year route) as a result of the increased minimum income requirement
2. **No breakdown** of whether people in the 10-year family route are parents or partners
3. **No data** on how many people remain stuck in the 10-year route beyond 10 years due to inability to afford Indefinite Leave to Remain fees (for which no fee waiver exists)
4. **No data** on families relying on a settled (rather than British citizen) family member, a group potentially affected by upcoming changes

The author notes that the earned settlement proposals announced the previous week appear to treat those unable to meet standard Appendix FM requirements differently, making these data gaps more significant for assessing the policy's impact.

## Summary: EU Settlement Scheme Settled Status Grants (Year Ending June 2025)

**Source:** GOV.UK Immigration System Statistics (year ending June 2025) — *Note: This is not the latest release.*

### Key Statistics

- **Total applications** to the EUSS since launch (August 2018) through June 2025: **8.6 million**
- **Total settled status grants** since launch: **4.3 million** (67% issued before the June 30, 2021 deadline)
- **Grants in year ending June 2025:** **335,321** — a **3% decrease** from the prior year (346,314), though volumes have stabilized over the past two years
- **Refusals in latest year:** 86,320 (15% of all concluded decisions); 99% of refusals based on eligibility grounds (typically insufficient evidence of residence)

### Notable Trends & Breakdown

- **Automated grants** (introduced January 2025): 37,260 pre-settled status holders were automatically transitioned to settled status between January–June 2025, representing **11% of all settled status grants** in the latest year
- **Repeat applications** resulting in settled status: 259,951 — a **15% decrease** from prior year, partly due to the automated transition process reducing the need for further applications
- **Late applications** resulting in settled status: 26,551 — a **12% increase** from prior year
- **Joining family members** granted settled status: 8,131 — a **32% decrease**, attributed to a substantial rise in invalid applications following an October 2024 policy change requiring applications within 3 months of first UK arrival

### Top Nationalities Granted Settled Status
- **EU nationals:** Romania (74,093), Italy (36,486), Poland (32,621)
- **Non-EEA nationals** (eligible as family members of EU/EEA/Swiss citizens): India (9,143), Pakistan (7,985), Brazil (4,401); the proportion of non-EEA nationals granted settled status has **increased** over the past 12 months

### Relevance to Forecasting Question
This article covers **EUSS settled status grants**, which operate under a separate framework from the standard indefinite leave to remain (ILR) pathway. The EUSS qualifying period is based on 5 years of UK residence and is governed by the EU Withdrawal Agreement — it is **not directly subject** to the proposed 10-year baseline change referenced in the forecasting question. The article contains **no information** about the proposed policy change to extend the settlement qualifying period to 10 years.

<Summary source="https://newlandchase.com/settlement-consultation-and-current-position-on-proposed-changes-to-immigration-rules/">
## Summary: UK Settlement Consultation – Current Position (Newland Chase, May 2025 onwards)

### Key Developments

**Immigration White Paper (May 12, 2025):**
- The UK government published its Immigration White Paper proposing significant changes to the settlement system.
- Settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain) would, for the first time, be formally incorporated into the Points-Based System.
- The **baseline qualifying period for settlement would increase from 5 to 10 years** for the majority of migrants.
- Certain visa categories would retain **accelerated pathways** to settlement.
- A concept of **"earned settlement"** would be introduced, emphasising long-term contribution, integration, and civic participation.

### Consultation Status
- A public consultation on earned settlement opened in **November 2025** and **closed February 12, 2026**.
- Approximately **130,000 responses** had been submitted as of February 2, 2026.
- A **Statement of Changes** is expected to be laid before Parliament in **March 2026**.
- Implementation dates are expected to be **staggered starting April 2026**, though these remain subject to change.

### Government Confirmation (February 2, 2026)
- During a Westminster Hall debate, **Minister for Migration and Citizenship Mike Tapp** confirmed the government intends to proceed with the earned settlement model, including **doubling the qualifying period from 5 to 10 years**.
- Questions around **retrospectivity and transitional arrangements** remain under review; no assurances were given to those already partway through a settlement route.

### Current Status
- **No changes to Immigration Rules have yet been implemented** as of the article's writing.
- Existing 5-year settlement routes remain in effect until new rules are enacted.
- The proposals remain at the **policy stage** and have not yet been transposed into Immigration Rules.

### Practical Guidance (for employers/individuals)
- Newland Chase recommends scenario-based financial modelling, reviewing workforce planning, and preparing communication strategies, but advises **against making decisions based on speculation** until formal announcements are made.

<Summary source="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9wlney23o">
## Summary: BBC Article – "Some migrants to face 20-year wait for settled status" (November 20, 2025)

### Core Announcement
Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced plans to extend the qualifying period for **Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)** from **5 to 10 years** as the new baseline. The changes would apply to an estimated **2.6 million migrants who arrived since 2021**, but not to those who had already obtained settlement.

### Tiered Waiting Periods
The proposed system introduces variable waiting periods based on circumstances:
- **3 years** – High earners (£125,140+ in the three years prior to applying)
- **5 years** – Earners above £50,270; NHS doctors and nurses
- **10 years** – New standard baseline
- **15 years** – Migrants who claimed benefits for less than 12 months; post-Brexit health and social care visa holders (up from 5 years)
- **20 years** – Migrants reliant on benefits for more than 12 months (described as "the longest in Europe")

Reductions can also be earned through volunteering and English language competency.

### Additional Requirements
Applicants must demonstrate:
- A-level standard English
- Clean criminal record
- Earnings above £12,570/year for at least three years
- Social integration and economic contribution ("earned settlement")

### Key Details
- **Family members** will not automatically gain status when the main applicant qualifies
- **Children** who arrived under age 18 may settle with parents; older dependants face separate requirements
- Existing fast-track routes for domestic abuse victims, bereaved partners, and resettled refugees remain intact
- The government plans to **roll out changes from spring 2026**, following a consultation ending **February 12**

### Political Reactions
- **Conservatives** (Chris Philp): Supportive but accused Labour of copying their own policies; called for a migration cap
- **Reform UK**: Did not respond in Commons; had previously proposed abolishing ILR entirely
- **Unison** (Christina McAnea): Called the changes "devastating to thousands of essential workers," warning care services could collapse without overseas staff

### Context
- Net migration added **2.6 million people** to the UK population between 2021 and 2024
- Around **1.6 million people** are forecast to seek settlement between 2026 and 2030
- The announcement is part of a broader immigration overhaul, including a separate plan to end permanent refugee status

## Summary: UK Settlement Overhaul – Implications for Employers (Employment Law Worldview, Dec. 8, 2025)

**Author:** Carine Elliott

### Core Proposal
The UK Government's Command Paper (*A Fairer Pathway to Settlement*) proposes replacing the current 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) with a merit-based system. Most migrants would face a **10-year qualifying period** — double the current term.

### Key Modifying Factors
- **Shorter waits** possible for high earners, key public service workers, or those demonstrating "exceptional integration"
- **Longer waits** (up to 20–30 years) for those with immigration breaches or heavy reliance on public funds
- Eligibility assessed against **four pillars** (not fully detailed in the article)

### Timeline (Critical for Resolution)
- Consultation closes: **February 12, 2026**
- Government Statement of Changes expected: **Spring 2026**
- Implementation likely to begin: **Summer 2026 onwards**
- The article explicitly states: **"current ILR rules remain in place"** until then

### Transitional Arrangements
Significant uncertainty remains regarding those already on the 5-year route, including whether existing visa holders can settle under current rules and how new requirements would apply retroactively.

### Employer Implications
- Increased sponsorship costs and administrative complexity over a decade-long tracking period
- Retention challenges, particularly in healthcare, technology, and hospitality
- Employee anxiety among sponsored workers expecting 5-year settlement

**Notable for forecasting:** The article's projected implementation timeline of **Summer 2026** suggests the changes would *not* come into effect before May 1, 2026, contradicting the Home Secretary's earlier indication of April 2026.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: According to the UK government's "Immigration system statistics, year ending September 2025," what was the breakdown of indefinite leave to remain (ILR) grants between EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) settled status grants and non-EUSS settlement grants? Specifically, did EUSS grants constitute a majority of all ILR/settlement grants in that period?
The Home Office publication “Immigration system statistics, year ending September 2025” exists (GOV.UK, 27 Nov 2025 – Immigration system statistics quarterly release). However, none of the material surfaced in the search results reproduces the detailed settlement table (Excel workbook Sett_02) that contains the numerical breakdown the question asks for.  

What the published webpages do provide is:

1.  Confirmation that the series still reports “Indefinite Leave (Settlement and EUSS settled status) grants” as a combined headline figure (Summary of latest statistics, Immigration system statistics, YE September 2025 – GOV.UK).

2.  Narrative statistics for the EU Settlement Scheme up to YE March 2025, e.g.  
    •  “just under 4.2 million applications have been granted settled status since the EUSS was launched” (How many grants of settlement are made via the EU Settlement Scheme?, Immigration system statistics, YE March 2025 – GOV.UK).  
    •  A note that automatic upgrades from pre-settled to settled status began in January 2025, resulting in 6,287 automated grants in the first quarter of 2025 (same source).

3.  Historical context from earlier Sett_02 tables (not reproduced here) showing that EUSS made up 88-93 % of all ILR grants in the years ending June 2022 and June 2023.

The search results do not supply:

•  The number of EUSS settled-status grants in the 12-month period October 2024 – September 2025.  
•  The number of non-EUSS settlement (standard ILR) grants in the same period.  
•  The resulting percentage share of each category.

Because those three figures are absent, it is impossible to state definitively from the material provided whether EUSS grants constituted a majority of all ILR/settlement grants in the year ending September 2025.  Based on earlier years and the introduction of automatic conversions in 2025 it is very likely that EUSS remained the dominant component, but this cannot be confirmed without the official totals in table Sett_02 (or an equivalent Home Office summary table).  

Remaining information gap  
The precise answer requires the two cells from Sett_02 – Grants of settlement by category:  
•  “EU Settlement Scheme – settled status” (year ending September 2025)  
•  “All other grants of settlement” (year ending September 2025)

Without those cells, neither the absolute breakdown nor the majority question can be answered with statistical certainty.</Agent_report>

### Key Facts Relevant to the Settlement Question

- The Home Office proposed a new **"earned settlement"** framework that would **increase the standard ILR qualifying period from 5 to 10 years** for most applicants.
- The article explicitly states: **"Changes may be introduced from April 2026"** and reiterates this later: **"Changes may come into force from April 2026."**
- A consultation on the proposals was opened, with the **consultation closing in February 2026**, after which further detail is expected to emerge.
- The article notes **uncertainty about transitional arrangements** for those already mid-way through their immigration journey.

### Additional Proposed Requirements Under "Earned Settlement"
- Clean criminal record
- No government debt or litigation
- English language proficiency to a high standard
- Minimum taxable income of £12,570 for 3–5 years before applying

### Modifying Factors
- **Reductions** possible for high earners or those on Global Talent/Innovator Founder visas
- **Extensions** possible for those who claimed public funds or entered on a visit visa or illegally

### Caveat
The article uses cautious language throughout ("may be introduced," "may come into force"), indicating the April 2026 implementation date was **not confirmed** as of the article's publication date.

## Summary: "A Fairer Pathway? How the 'Earned Settlement' Proposals Risk Discriminating Against Migrant Women" (Free Movement, February 5, 2026)

### Core Subject
This article, published ahead of the February 12, 2026 consultation deadline, critiques the UK government's "earned settlement" proposals — specifically their disproportionate impact on migrant women.

---

### Key Facts About the Proposals
- The proposals establish a **10-year baseline route to settlement**, which can be shortened or lengthened based on earnings, skill level, language competency, and other contributions (e.g., volunteering).
- **Accelerated timelines** are available for higher earners:
  - **3 years** for those earning £125,140 taxable income over the prior 3 years
  - **5 years** for those earning £50,270 taxable income over the prior 3 years
- The minimum earnings threshold to qualify for the baseline is **£12,570/year** for a continuous 3–5 year period.
- Workers in **medium-skilled roles (below RQF level 6)** and **carers** could face an **extended qualifying period of up to 15 years**.

---

### Gender Pay Gap Evidence Cited
- In 2024/25, **78% of responding employers** reported median hourly pay was higher for men than women.
- Median hourly pay for **full-time employees** was **6.9% less** for women (April 2025).
- Median pay for **all employees** (including part-time) was **12.8% less** for women (April 2025).
- The gender pay gap is **wider among high-paid employees** and women's share in high-paying occupations **decreases with age**.

### Caregiving Disparities
- **83% of mothers** took maternity leave vs. **59% of fathers** taking paternity leave.
- Average paternity leave duration: **1.7 weeks**; majority of women took **39 weeks or more**.
- The consultation contains only **one reference to maternity leave**, framing it as a deviation from the norm rather than a protected characteristic.

### Workplace Discrimination Data
- **53% of young women** report experiencing workplace discrimination (Young Women's Trust), rising to **61% among racially minoritised young women**.

### Health and Care Visa
- Government data from **May 2025** indicates **74% of those sponsored on the Health and Care visa are women** — a group that could face up to 15-year qualifying periods under the proposals.

### Dependant Partners
- Home Office figures (May 2025): **33% of dependant partners** earned £17,501–£25,000/year, with many earning less.
- The proposals suggest dependants' qualifying periods will be **separately determined** based on their own earnings/attributes, not their partner's.
- Example cited: Nursery fees in Greater Manchester for visa holders with **no recourse to public funds** are approximately **£1,521 per child per month**.

---

### Key Criticism (from the article's authors/sources)
- Tying settlement to earnings **compounds existing labour market inequalities** that disproportionately affect women.
- The proposals fail to adequately account for **maternity leave, caregiving responsibilities, and structural discrimination**.
- The article calls for **Home Office and ONS immigration statistics** to routinely publish data on dependants by gender to better understand and mitigate gendered consequences.

---

### Relevance to the Forecasting Question
The article **assumes the 10-year baseline is proceeding**, treating it as an imminent policy reality rather than a speculative proposal. The consultation closes **February 12, 2026**, and the article's framing suggests implementation is expected, consistent with the previously stated **April 2026 target date**.

## Summary: UK Government's Earned Settlement Consultation (Womble Bond Dickinson Guide)

### Background & Rationale
The UK Government is conducting a 12-week consultation to reform its immigration settlement framework. The Immigration White Paper (May 2025) underpins these reforms, with ministers arguing settlement should be a **"privilege, not a right"** rather than an automatic outcome of time spent in the UK. The new "earned settlement" model ties permanent residency to demonstrated integration, economic contribution, and good character.

---

### Key Universal Requirements Proposed
- **Good character**: Clean criminal record and lawful conduct history
- **English language**: Minimum B2 level (CEFR), plus Life in the UK test
- **Economic contribution**: Sustained employment with taxable earnings of at least **£12,570** for 3–5 years prior to application
- **No outstanding debts**: No unpaid NHS charges, tax debts, or unresolved government litigation

---

### Proposed Changes to Qualifying Periods
| Route | Current Period | Proposed Period |
|---|---|---|
| Skilled Worker (RQF Level 6+), Health & Care | 5 years | **10 years** |
| Skilled Worker (Below RQF Level 6) | 5 years | **15 years** |
| Global Talent | 3–5 years | **3 years** |
| Innovator Founder | 3 years | **3 years** (no change) |
| Partner/Spouse (Family route) | 5 years | **10 years** |

The article notes the **10-year long residence route is under consideration for removal**.

---

### Attributes That Can Shorten the Qualifying Period
*(Only the single largest reduction applies)*
- C1 English proficiency: **−1 year**
- Taxable income ≥£125,410 for 3 years: **−7 years**
- Taxable income ≥£50,270 for 3 years: **−5 years**
- 5 years in specified public service: **−5 years**
- Community volunteering: **−3 to 5 years**
- Global Talent/Innovator Founder (3 years continuous): **−7 years**
- Parent/partner/child of British citizen: **−5 years** *(not subject to consultation)*

---

### Attributes That Can Lengthen the Qualifying Period
*(Only the single largest increase applies)*
- Public funds received <12 months: **+5 years**
- Public funds received >12 months: **+10 years**
- Arrived in UK illegally: **up to +20 years**
- Entered on visit visa: **up to +20 years**
- Overstayed by 6+ months: **up to +20 years**

---

### Cost Implications
The article provides a worked example of a sponsored Architect earning £48,000/year. Without qualifying shortening attributes, they may need **9 years** (vs. the current 5), requiring a 4-year visa extension. The additional costs borne by the sponsoring employer would include:
- Certificate of Sponsorship: £525
- Immigration Skills Charge: £5,280
- Visa application fee: £1,751
- Immigration Health Surcharge: £4,140
- **Total additional cost: ~£11,696** (excluding adviser fees, dependant visas, and priority services)
