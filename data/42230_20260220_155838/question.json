If a change is announced, but does not come in to effect before May 1, 2026, it will not be sufficient to resolve this question.\n\nThis question will not consider any modifications that change the residency requirement; only the baseline requirement will matter for this question.\n\nIf the baseline requirement is increased for some visa categories but not others, this question will resolve according to how the new baseline would have applied to the majority of grants in [the year ending September 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-september-2025/how-many-indefinite-leave-settlement-and-euss-settled-status-and-citizenship-grants-have-been-issued-in-the-uk#s-2).\n\n***\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/42135) which opened on 2026-02-18 17:00:00.
