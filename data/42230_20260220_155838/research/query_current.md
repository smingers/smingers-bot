Analysis:
We need to know whether the UK government has legally enacted – and made effective before 1 May 2026 – a change that doubles the baseline qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) from five to ten years. Relevant information will come from:
• Home Office or UK Visas & Immigration announcements, draft Immigration Rules, or final Statutory Instruments laying the rules before Parliament.  
• Parliamentary debates, committee reports, or Hansard entries since late-2025 on the “earned settlement” consultation, the forthcoming Immigration Rules Statement of Changes, or an Immigration Bill that could embed the 10-year requirement.  
• Press coverage (FT, Guardian, BBC, Politico, Law Society Gazette) tracking whether the rule change has cleared the negative/affirmative resolution procedure and whether its commencement date is indeed April 2026 or has slipped.  
• Stakeholder commentary (law firms, ILPA, Fragomen, CIPD) monitoring transition provisions that might delay implementation past May 2026.  

Current articles in the last few weeks (Feb 2026) will reveal if the rule has been passed, if opposition amendments could block it, or if the Home Office has issued the final Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules that actually makes the 10-year baseline operative on, say, 6 April 2026. That is exactly what forecasters need now.
