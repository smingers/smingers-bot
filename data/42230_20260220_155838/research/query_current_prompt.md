You are currently doing research for current information/news articles on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will the UK increase the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years before May 2026?

Question background:
Immigrants to the UK can currently apply for permanent residency – or "indefinite leave to remain" – after living in the country [for 5 years under most visa categories](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain#:~:text=You%20must%20usually%20have%20lived%20and%20worked%20in%20the%20UK%20for%205%20years).

Shabana Mahmood, the Home Secretary, has proposed a change to the requirements to apply for this status; the core changes proposed include increasing [the baseline requirement to 10 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#:~:text=a\)%20increasing%20the%20baseline%20qualifying%20period%20for%20settlement%20to%2010%20years) while also introducing modifying factors which may increase or reduce this period.

This change is driven by [forecasts of record high applications](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#future-settlement-forecast) for residency over the next five years and a backdrop of [21% of British people polled](https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx) considering immigration to be Britain's "biggest national problem".

In November 2025, Mahmood indicated that the changes would come into effect [in April 2026.](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-11-20/debates/E3CE324D-7597-40C5-8697-DB48AA843CFC/MigrationSettlementPathway#contribution-44475956-0A57-466A-A4EA-7A7FD64AAD83)

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before May 1, 2026, the baseline qualifying period for settlement (permanent residency) in the UK is 10 or more years.

Additional fine-print:
To qualify a change must affect at least some applicants for permanent residency before May 2026. If a change is announced, but does not come in to effect before May 1, 2026, it will not be sufficient to resolve this question.

This question will not consider any modifications that change the residency requirement; only the baseline requirement will matter for this question.

If the baseline requirement is increased for some visa categories but not others, this question will resolve according to how the new baseline would have applied to the majority of grants in [the year ending September 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-september-2025/how-many-indefinite-leave-settlement-and-euss-settled-status-and-citizenship-grants-have-been-issued-in-the-uk#s-2).
