Analysis:
To judge the likelihood that the baseline qualifying period will actually rise to 10 years before 1 May 2026, it is useful to know 1) the legislative or regulatory vehicle being used (primary legislation, Immigration Rules change, or a Statutory Instrument), 2) the current stage of that vehicle and its scheduled commencement date, 3) any precedent for similar last-minute reversals or delays in UK immigration rule changes, and 4) the positions of key stakeholders (Home Office, opposition, Lords, courts, business groups). Historical material on the “Earned Settlement” consultation launched in 2025, subsequent White Paper, drafts of new Immigration Rules, Hansard debates (Nov 2025 statement), and commentary by UK immigration lawyers will provide that context.
