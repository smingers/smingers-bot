The government's earned settlement proposals\" (UK in a Changing Europe, Feb 13, 2026)\n\n**Author/Source:** James Bowes, Space Management Assistant, Strategic Planning and Analytics, University of Warwick \u2014 published via UK in a Changing Europe, an academic policy analysis organization.\n\n---\n\n### Core Subject\nThe article analyzes the UK government's \"earned settlement\" consultation (which closed February 13, 2026), focusing on its proposed changes to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) eligibility and its impact on both new and existing migrants.\n\n---\n\n### Key Facts & Proposed Changes\n\n**Universal changes affecting all ILR applicants:**\n- English language requirement raised from B1 to B2\n- Applicants must earn over \u00a312,570/year for at least three years\n- **Baseline qualifying period announced as 10 years**\n\n**Tiered qualifying periods under the proposals:**\n| Group | Qualifying Period |\n|---|---|\n| High earners (>\u00a3125,140/year) | 3 years |\n| Family of British nationals, BNO holders, graduate-level jobs (>\u00a350,270 or eligible public sector) | 5 years |\n| Global talent/innovator founder visa holders | Unchanged |\n| **Baseline (most applicants)** | **10 years** |\n| Sub-graduate skilled workers | 15 years |\n| Refugees | 20 years |\n| Illegal entrants, visa overstayers, visitor visa entrants | 30 years |\n\n---\n\n### Who Is Affected\n- **Over 2 million migrants already living in the UK** will face tougher requirements \u2014 a notable distinction from previous immigration restrictions, which typically only affected new arrivals\n- Roughly **two-thirds** of those affected hold work visas or are dependants of work visa holders\n- Most others are on family visas or have humanitarian status\n- **~Half of main work visa holders** face a 15-year wait (sub-graduate level jobs)\n- **Most dependants** of even high-paid workers face at least a 10-year wait, as the dependant themselves must meet the salary/occupation threshold independently\n\n---\n\n### Additional Structural Concerns Raised\n- **Redundancy risk** is significantly higher over a 15-year visa period than a 5-year one\n- Employers may be unwilling to pay the **Immigration Skills Charge** for 15 years\n- **Lower salary thresholds** (for those on skilled worker visas continuously since before April 2024) are scheduled to expire in **April 2030**, potentially requiring large pay rises for continued eligibility\n- The **Immigration Salary List** (which allows a 20% salary discount for shortage occupations) ends **January 2027** (July 2028 for care workers), further restricting renewal options\n- Workers in occupations downgraded to \"low-skilled\" in April 2024 can only renew visas until **April 2030**, and only with the same employer and occupation \u2014 raising concerns about exploitation\n\n---\n\n### Author's Assessment *(less formal/opinion-based, from a university analyst rather than a policymaker or independent research body)*\n- The changes amount to **\"remigration by stealth\"** \u2014 not explicitly requiring people to leave, but structurally making it very difficult for many to remain\n- The government claims forced departure is not the objective, but the author argues **\"far-reaching transitional protections\"** would be needed to prevent it\n- Many legal migrants will be unable or unwilling to sustain visa costs, fees, and employment constraints over 15 years, effectively forcing departure\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.jobbatical.com/blog/uk-earned-settlement-ilr-updates\">\n## Summary: UK ILR 10-Year Route Changes 2026 (Jobbatical)\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be from an HR/immigration advisory service (Jobbatical) rather than an official government source.

Eligible debts include tax arrears, social security contributions, and traffic fines from prefectures, provided they were assigned to collection between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2023. Applications must be submitted by April 30, 2026. The settlement enables payment in up to 54 equal bimonthly installments over a maximum period of nine years, with the first payment due on July 31, 2026, and the final one by May 2035. Interest of 3% annually applies from August 1, 2026. Each installment must be at least \u20ac100, as set by the Budget Law. The Agenzia delle Entrate Riscossione will issue a payment schedule and payment slips by June 30, 2026, based on the taxpayer\u2019s chosen repayment method. Failure to pay two installments, or missing the first or final payment, results in loss of benefits. Unlike previous settlement plans, there is no 5-day grace period under rottamazione quinquies. Those already in the 'rottamazione quater' program must pay special attention to the dual deadlines of July 31 and November 30, 2026, which involve different rules.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 09:04 AM\nSource:[Tiscali](https://notizie.tiscali.it/economia/articoli/rottamazione-quinquies/)\n\n**Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore India and South Africa : How Commonwealth Citizens Can Live and Work in the UK Through the Ancestry Visa - Travel And Tour World**\nCommonwealth citizens from countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, and South Africa can access various UK visa pathways to live, work, or study in the UK, depending on eligibility. While no single 'Commonwealth visa' exists, several routes are specifically available to nationals of these countries. The UK Ancestry visa allows individuals with at least one grandparent born in the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, or pre-1922 Republic of Ireland to live and work in the UK, with the potential for Indefinite Leave to Remain after five years and eventual British citizenship. The Right of Abode provides permanent, unrestricted residency for those with historic British nationality status before 1 January 1983, requiring a Certificate of Entitlement. The Youth Mobility Scheme enables citizens aged 18 to 35 from eligible countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, New Zealand) to live and work in the UK for up to two years, though dependents cannot be brought and the visa is non-extendable. The BNO Visa is available specifically to Hong Kong\u2019s British National (Overseas) citizens, offering a five-year path to settlement and citizenship. For those not qualifying for these specialized routes, standard visas such as the Skilled Worker Visa (requiring a UK job offer) and Family Visa (for joining family members) remain available. The article emphasizes that while Commonwealth citizenship does not grant automatic rights, these tailored pathways make UK travel and long-term residence feasible in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 07:38 AM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/australia-canada-new-zealand-hong-kong-singapore-india-and-south-africa-how-commonwealth-citizens-can-live-and-work-in-the-uk-through-the-ancestry-visa/)\n\n**DWP to 'double' time thousands have to wait before accessing benefit - Birmingham Live**\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) plans to double the waiting period for migrants to access benefits from 5 to 10 years, as part of a crackdown on welfare spending. This policy change follows research by the Centre for Migration Control, which claims that migrant households received over \u00a315 billion in benefits within 18 months, with 70% of those households including at least one unemployed foreign national. The think tank's director, Robert Bates, stated that it is 'a no-brainer' to end benefit payments to foreign nationals, especially the unemployed. A Labour Party spokesperson affirmed the government's stance: 'if you come to the UK, you should contribute,' and confirmed the planned 10-year waiting period and a consultation on prioritizing benefits for those who contribute to the UK economy. The Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, reiterated that migrants must become British citizens before qualifying for benefits or social housing. The figures cited\u2014\u00a39.5 billion in Universal Credit paid in 2024 and \u00a35.6 billion in the first half of 2025\u2014are based on household-level data, meaning benefits may also support British partners or children, and some unemployed foreign nationals may actually be self-employed with low or irregular incomes.

Effective from 16 February 2026, as per a new Office Memorandum (OM), Department Heads (HODs) in ministries can now directly approve medical claims up to \u20b910 lakh without requiring external financial advice (IFD), doubling the previous limit of \u20b95 lakh. Claims within this new limit will be settled at the local level, drastically reducing delays. Two key conditions must be met for fast processing: claims must strictly follow existing CGHS or CS(MA) rules without relaxation requests, and hospital bills must be based entirely on government-fixed CGHS rates. If bills exceed CGHS rates and a relaxation is sought, the claim will still follow the old, lengthy process. Additionally, the settlement limit for claims has increased from \u20b92 lakh to \u20b95 lakh, eliminating most technical delays. Pensioners must submit claims within six months of hospital discharge to their respective Wellness Center's Chief Medical Officer (CMO). The reform also extends reimbursement to ambulance charges within the city, provided a doctor certifies the patient\u2019s condition made alternative transport unsafe. This change aims to provide timely financial relief and streamline the system.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 02:43 AM\nSource:[punjabkesari](https://m.punjabkesari.in/national/news/government-offices-central-employees-pensioners-medical-claims-reimbursemet-2295615)\n\n**New Tax Settlement Rules in 2026: What Changes, Deadlines, and When to Act**\nFor taxpayers with pending tax debts, 2026 is a critical year. The rottamazione quater (fourth tax settlement) will not see a broad reopening, as an amendment to extend the deadline for defaulted contributors to pay the November 30, 2025 installment by February 28, 2026\u2014effective until March 9, 2026, accounting for weekends\u2014was not voted on by the Chamber's Constitutional Affairs and Budget Committees. A later proposal to extend this to other defaulted quater participants also failed. Thus, those who missed prior deadlines remain excluded from quater. In contrast, rottamazione quinquies, introduced by the 2026 Budget Law, offers a new fiscal amnesty allowing debtors to regularize unpaid taxes without penalties or interest, with the option to pay in up to 54 bi-monthly installments. Eligible debts are those assigned to collection between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2023. Applications must be submitted by April 30, 2026, with the chosen payment method (e.g., up to 54 bi-monthly installments) binding the plan. Installments must be at least \u20ac100 each, which may limit the number of payments for smaller debts. Interest at 3% annually applies from August 1, 2026. The key advantage of quinquies is the ability to spread payments over up to 9 years. With quater not reopening, quinquies becomes the primary opportunity for taxpayers to resolve long-standing fiscal debts, making careful planning essential to avoid losing benefits.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 02:24 AM\nSource:[La Nuova Sardegna](https://www.lanuovasardegna.it/regione/2026/02/19/news/novita-su-rottamazione-quater-e-quinquies-cosa-cambia-quali-sono-le-nuove-scadenze-e-quando-conviene-aderire-1.100834398)\n\n**Fury as migrant households pocket 'over \u00a315bn in benefits' in just 18 months**\nAccording to a study by the Centre for Migration Control, migrant households in the UK received over \u00a315 billion in benefits within 18 months, with \u00a39.5 billion paid in 2024 and \u00a35.6 billion in the first half of 2025. The research, based on Freedom of Information (FOI) data, indicates that 70% of this amount went to households with at least one unemployed foreign national. Research director Robert Bates stated that it is 'a no-brainer' to end benefit payments to foreign nationals, especially the unemployed. Of the 2024 total, \u00a36.7 billion went to households where the foreign-national claimant was not employed. However, the data is household-level, meaning some funds may have been used by British partners or children, and some 'unemployed' foreign nationals may be self-employed with irregular or low earnings. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has pledged that only British citizens will qualify for benefits and social housing. The Conservative Party and Reform UK advocate stricter limits. A government spokesperson emphasized that migrants should contribute, noting plans to double the waiting period for benefits from 2 to 10 years and to prioritize benefits for those who contribute to the UK economy. The spokesperson also clarified that individuals in the UK illegally, without immigration status, cannot claim taxpayer-funded benefits.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 09:00 PM\nSource:[The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/38279745/migrant-households-pocket-benefits-study-claims/)\n\n**Government's 'earned settlement' proposal is 'destructive', warns Jesuit Refugee Service - The Tablet**\nThe Jesuit Refugee Service UK (JRS UK), in collaboration with the European Network on Statelessness (ENS), Asylum Aid, the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association (ILPA), Just Right Scotland, and other experts, has strongly criticized the UK government\u2019s proposed 'earned settlement' policy, warning it is 'destructive' and would entrench insecurity, poverty, and exclusion. The proposal would extend the period for most immigrants to gain indefinite leave to remain from five to ten years and make settlement conditional on 'earning' it through sustained economic contribution, a clean criminal record, high-level English proficiency, and no national debt. Exceptions could be made for those making 'an outsized contribution'\u2014such as high earners, senior public servants, or extensive volunteers\u2014but those who claim benefits or entered irregularly would face delayed settlement. JRS UK\u2019s senior policy officer, Sophie Cartwright, called the policy 'utterly cruel, unworkable, and damaging,' stating it would trap refugees, migrants, and stateless people in prolonged limbo, risk prolonging statelessness, and harm children across generations. The groups urge the government to maintain a clear, accessible, and timely route to settlement without conditionality and to adopt a humane, evidence-based approach. They also highlighted a five-fold increase in homeless or at-risk refugee households over four years, with rough sleeping common among refused asylum seekers, and condemned the 'hostile or compliant environment' that restricts access to public funds and intentionally bars essential services based on immigration status. The government\u2019s consultation closed on 12 February 2026, with policy changes expected by April 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 05:29 PM\nSource:[The Tablet](https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/governments-earned-settlement-proposal-is-destructive-warns-jesuit-refugee-service/)\n\n**'Death tax' loopholes to use before April as inheritance tax threshold changes**\nFarmers and landowners across the UK are being urged to take action before April 6, 2026, to take advantage of upcoming changes to inheritance tax rules.

This change will allow spouses or civil partners to pass on up to \u00a35 million in qualifying agricultural or business assets tax-free, in addition to existing allowances.

This measure, part of broader legislation under parliamentary review, aims to strengthen protections for women and girls amid rising concerns over online abuse and the misuse of AI to generate explicit content. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that 'the online world is the frontline of the 21st century battle against violence against women and girls.' Although sharing such images is already illegal in the UK, victims have reported delays in removals. Under the new rules, victims need only report an image once, and platforms must remove it across all services and prevent re-uploads using 'hash-matching' tools. Ofcom will fast-track a decision on these tools by May 2026, with potential implementation by summer 2026. The government is also considering treating the sharing of illegal intimate images with the same severity as child sexual abuse and terrorist content, and is evaluating restrictions on social media access for users under 16, similar to Australia\u2019s approach.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 03:14 AM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-to-impose-48-hour-online-takedown-rule-for-non-consensual-intimate-images-11056273)\n\n**New UK driving law that could see elderly drivers fined \u00a31,000 is delayed**\nThe UK government has delayed the implementation of proposed new driving laws aimed at improving road safety, including mandatory eyesight tests for older drivers every three years, extending the public consultation period until May 11, 2026. The measures are part of a broader Labour government initiative to reduce road deaths and serious injuries. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that progress on road safety has 'stalled' and emphasized that the new rules will save thousands of lives over the next decade. The proposed changes reinforce existing legal obligations regarding vision, requiring drivers who need corrective lenses to wear them at all times while driving. MoneySuperMarket insurance expert Alicia Hempsted warned that failing to comply could result in a \u00a31,000 fine and three penalty points, and could invalidate car insurance in the event of an accident. She stressed the importance of regular eye tests every two years, as vision can deteriorate gradually without notice. Edmund King OBE, director of The AA Charitable Trust and AA president, praised the government's strategy as a 'radical reframing of road safety' and 'long overdue,' commending the ambitious targets to reduce fatalities by tackling issues such as drink and drug driving, seatbelt non-compliance, and driving without insurance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 04:55 PM\nSource:[The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/38264434/new-uk-driving-law-elderly-drivers-fined-delayed-labour/)\n\n**The quiet UK rule change that could delay Settlement for millions of migrants**\nThe UK is undergoing its most significant immigration reform in 50 years, shifting from a time-based settlement system to a 'earned settlement' model. Under the proposed changes, the standard qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain (settlement) would increase from five to ten years for most migrants, unless they qualify for faster routes based on high income, skilled work, or exceptional contributions. The 3-year route remains available for Global Talent and Innovator-Founder visa holders, while the 5-year route is still accessible for Skilled Worker and family-based applicants, but now requires proof of ongoing economic contribution, English proficiency (B2 level), tax compliance, and good character. The 10-year long residence route is expected to become the default path for many migrants. Family members may apply concurrently if they meet dependency and residency criteria, including English and character requirements. The reforms, proposed by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, also include stricter income thresholds and behavior evaluations. Exemptions are expected for those under the EU Settlement Scheme.

Under the proposed 'earned settlement model', eligibility could be adjusted based on income, occupation, and other criteria, with high earners and public sector workers potentially fast-tracked, while care workers could face up to 15 years before qualifying. The charity warns the policy would disproportionately harm low-to-middle earners, refugees, care workers, and those who lawfully accessed public funds due to illness, job loss, or disability. Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol, CEO of the Work Rights Centre, stated the changes\u2014set to apply retroactively\u2014would undermine trust in the UK\u2019s immigration system, increase exploitation, and deepen divisions between British-born and migrant workers. Migrants like Sri, an AI engineer from India in Belfast, and Staicey, a healthcare support worker from Cardiff, reported severe mental health impacts and feelings of betrayal, citing broken trust in British values. ILR is critical for migrants as it grants unrestricted work rights, removes dependence on employer-sponsored visas, reduces exploitation risks, and eliminates recurring visa renewal costs. The government argues that permanent settlement is a privilege, not a right, and cites over 2 million migrants arriving since 2021 under post-Brexit rules as justification. Legal experts, including Palak Gupta of Jotwani Associates, note Indian nationals\u2014among the largest groups of skilled workers, students, and family-route migrants\u2014would be especially affected due to prolonged temporary status, higher costs, and uncertainty in long-term planning. While legal challenges face significant hurdles due to the state\u2019s sovereign authority over immigration policy, experts advise Indian nationals to monitor the consultation, maintain records, and engage in collective advocacy through diaspora groups and MPs. The public consultation runs until February 2026, with new rules expected to take effect from April 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 18, 2025 05:14 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/immigration/uk-settlement-in-10-years-why-indians-and-other-migrants-oppose-the-rule-125121800275_1.html)\n\n**UK Government Announces Plans to Move to an Earned Settlement Model and Opens Consultation**\nThe UK government has announced plans to transition to an 'earned settlement' model based on a 'time adjustment' system, increasing the standard residence period for settlement from five to ten years for most migrants. This change, outlined in the Restoring Control over the Immigration System White Paper (May 2025), aims to ensure that migrants make demonstrable economic and societal contributions before qualifying for Indefinite Leave to Remain. The consultation on the proposed reforms will close at 11:59 pm on 12 February 2026, with implementation planned for April 2026. Under the new system, applicants will be assigned a baseline residence period of 10 years, which may be adjusted based on individual contributions\u2014such as high earnings, skills, or public service\u2014through four core pillars. Positive adjustments may reduce the period, while negative adjustments may extend it. However, the five-year settlement pathway will remain for holders of the EU Settlement Scheme, family members of British citizens, and British National (Overseas) visa holders. Accelerated routes for Global Talent and Innovator Founder visa holders will continue, allowing settlement after three years. Dependants\u2019 settlement periods will be assessed independently based on their own attributes, potentially leading to different qualification timelines. The consultation will also consider whether dependants of Global Talent and Innovator Founder visa holders should retain a five-year path and how to handle children, whose contribution-based requirements may not be applicable. The new rules will apply to individuals not already settled at the time of implementation, with the government seeking input on transitional arrangements for those already on settlement pathways. Employers are advised to prepare for the changes, which will significantly impact current and future foreign national employees.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 05:05 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/uk-government-announces-plans-to-move-2522476/)\n\n**UK workers' charity cautions against 'callous' 10-year settlement rule**\nThe UK Home Office has proposed a significant overhaul of its immigration settlement rules, extending the baseline qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) to 10 years for most migrants, with potential increases to 15 years for Skilled Worker and Health and Care Worker visa holders, and up to 20 years for those accessing state-funded welfare benefits. The changes, set to take effect in April 2026, are part of a broader 'earned settlement' model that rewards contributions to British society. Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol, CEO of the Work Rights Centre, condemned the 10-year rule as 'callous' and the 20-year wait for welfare recipients as 'particularly dystopian,' arguing it penalizes migrant families for vulnerability and undermines integration. Indian-origin Labour MP Warinder Juss, representing Wolverhampton West, acknowledged the benefits of migration, citing her own family\u2019s story as proof, while supporting the reforms. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (referred to as 'Mahmood' in the article, though this appears to be an error in attribution; the correct name is Yvette Cooper) emphasized that settlement is a 'privilege, not a right,' and that reforms are necessary due to the influx of over 2 million migrants since 2021 under the post-Brexit 'Boriswave' policy. The proposal includes fast-tracking pathways to three years for high earners, Global Talent, Innovation Founders, and proficient English speakers, as well as for those engaged in community volunteering. A public consultation runs until mid-February 2026 to assess transitional arrangements for those already on a settlement path. The reforms target an estimated 1.6 million people qualifying for ILR between 2026 and 2030, with a peak of 450,000 in 2028.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 02:30 PM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/world/uk-workers-charity-cautions-against-callous-10-year-settlement-rule/2789499/)\n\n**UK doubles settlement period to 10 years under new 'earned' migration model**\nThe UK government has proposed doubling the settlement period for most international migrants under a new 'earned settlement' model, increasing the standard route to indefinite leave to remain (ILR) from five to ten years. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that settling in the UK is 'not a right but a privilege, and it must be earned,' emphasizing a shift toward a contribution-based system. Under the new rules, low-paid workers will face a 15-year wait for ILR, while those accessing taxpayer-funded benefits may have to wait up to 20 years. In contrast, skilled professionals in frontline sectors\u2014such as doctors and nurses in the NHS\u2014and high-earning entrepreneurs could qualify for ILR after as few as three to five years. Illegal migrants and visa overstayers would face a 30-year waiting period. The changes apply to over 2 million migrants who arrived between 2021 and 2024, often referred to as the 'Boriswave' due to the prior government\u2019s immigration policies. A consultation, running until February 2026, will finalize transitional arrangements and determine whether taxpayer-funded benefits are restricted to those with British citizenship\u2014applied one year after obtaining settled status. The reforms target an estimated 1.6 million people qualifying for ILR between 2026 and 2030, with a peak of 450,000 expected in 2028. Additional criteria for faster settlement include a clean criminal record, high-level English proficiency, and community volunteering. Mahmood stressed that successful migration depends on integration and contribution, not assimilation, affirming the UK\u2019s pluralistic, multi-ethnic democracy. The policy follows earlier measures to tighten the asylum system, including temporary refugee status until home countries are deemed safe for return.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 03:15 PM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/uk-doubles-settlement-period-to-10-years-under-new-earned-migration-model-9721579.html)\n\n**Government issues statement as major overhaul of legal migration proposed - Manchester Evening News**\nThe UK government, through Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, has announced a major overhaul of legal migration rules, proposing to extend the eligibility period for indefinite leave to remain from five to ten years. This change, part of a broader immigration reform strategy first outlined in the May immigration white paper, aims to reduce overall migration numbers. Mahmood emphasized that long-term settlement is a 'privilege' to be earned, not an automatic right, noting that current five-year residency grants access to many rights of British citizens, including benefits. Under the proposed changes, migrants must meet conditions such as a clean criminal record, English proficiency at A-level standard, no state debt, and sustained National Insurance contributions. A consultation launched on November 20, 2025, will run until February and explores variable wait times: public service workers (e.g., doctors, nurses) or high-tax contributors may qualify after five years, while lower-qualified workers from the 2022 'Boris wave' could face a 15-year wait. Illegal residents may have to wait up to 30 years. Additionally, access to benefits and social housing would be restricted until citizenship is obtained, and volunteering as a pathway to earlier settlement is under review. The reforms are expected to be rolled out in spring 2026. The government projects 1.6 million people will settle in the UK between 2026 and 2030, peaking at 450,000 in 2028.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 02:41 PM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/government-issues-statement-major-overhaul-32912782)\n\n**Mahmood to ban migrants without citizenship from claiming benefits**\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced sweeping reforms to the UK's immigration system, proposing that migrants can only access benefits and social housing after becoming British citizens. She emphasized that settlement in the UK is 'not a right, but a privilege' and must be earned through contribution, integration, and adherence to British values. Under the new 'contribution-based model', the default qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) will increase from five to ten years. However, this period can be reduced to five years for those paying higher rates of tax, three years for top-rate taxpayers or global talent visa holders, and five years for public service workers like doctors and teachers. Volunteers will receive a reduction of three to five years. Conversely, those who claimed benefits for over 12 months face a 10-year penalty, and those who arrived illegally could face up to a 20-year penalty, potentially extending their wait to 30 years. The 'Boris-wave' cohort\u2014migrants arriving post-Brexit under Boris Johnson\u2014will face a 15-year default period, with a maximum of 25 years if they claimed benefits for more than 12 months. The reforms apply only to those without settled status, with a clear commitment not to alter the status of current settled individuals. Mahmood stressed that migration remains vital to Britain but must be managed so that newcomers contribute meaningfully. She stated, 'We must prove that it can still work,' and affirmed that the changes aim to uphold fairness and integration. Current forecasts project 1.6 million people will settle in the UK between 2026 and 2030, peaking at 450,000 in 2028.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 01:36 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mahmood-asylum-reform-migrants-benefits-visas-b2869103.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
