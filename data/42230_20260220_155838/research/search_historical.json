The consultation on increasing the baseline to 10 years was **open** (not yet enacted) as of the article's publication. The data on grant volumes by category would be relevant to the fine print condition about which visa categories represent the **majority of grants**.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain#:~:text=You%20must%20usually%20have%20lived%20and%20worked%20in%20the%20UK%20for%205%20years\">\n## Summary: UK Indefinite Leave to Remain \u2013 GOV.UK\n\n**Note:** This is a general informational page from GOV.UK about eligibility for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR).

The consultation concerns the *conditions* under which settlement can be earned, not whether the 10-year baseline will be implemented.\n\n---\n\n### Key Facts & Statistics\n\n- **Net migration 2021\u20132024**: approximately 2.6 million people (~1 in 30 current UK residents arrived in this four-year period)\n- **Health and Care visa arrivals 2022\u20132024**: 616,000 individuals (over half were dependants, not workers)\n- **Forecast settlement grants 2026\u20132030**: ~1.6 million people, peaking at ~450,000 per year in 2028\n- **Current baseline**: 5 years for most visa categories; criminal sentence threshold of over 1 year\n\n---\n\n### Proposed \"Earned Settlement\" Framework\n\nThe new model is built on **four core pillars**:\n1. **Character** \u2013 Clean criminal record required (no ability to offset); full review of criminality thresholds underway\n2. **Integration** \u2013 Demonstrated meaningful engagement with British society\n3. **Contribution** \u2013 Sustained, measurable economic contribution\n4. **Residence** \u2013 Lawful, continuous residence (residence alone will not normally qualify)\n\n### Time Adjustment Model\n- **Baseline**: 10 years (up from 5)\n- **Accelerated settlement** possible for: high-talent/high-taxpaying individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers\n- **Faster settlement** (not subject to consultation): spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong\n- **Delayed settlement** for: benefit claimants, those who entered the UK illegally (20-year path for refugees on \"core protection\" support)\n\n---\n\n### Additional Consultation Options\nThe document consults on three specific options to reduce forecast settlement volumes:\n- **(a)** Increasing baseline qualifying period to **10 years**\n- **(b)** Increasing qualifying period to **15 years** for Skilled Workers in roles below RQF Level 6 (below bachelor's degree level)\n- **(c)** Implementing a **No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF)** condition at settlement\n\nA **separate 15-year baseline** is proposed specifically for lower-wage Health and Care visa migrants who bring non-working dependants.\n\n---\n\n### Retroactivity\nThe government proposes applying these changes to **all current migrants who have not yet received indefinite leave to remain** \u2014 meaning those currently on track for settlement under the old 5-year rule would be subject to the new requirements once immigration rules change. Those who **already hold** settled status are explicitly excluded from any changes.\n\n---\n\n### Scope Exclusions\n- EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) \u2013 out of scope\n- Windrush Scheme grants \u2013 out of scope\n- Those already holding settled status \u2013 out of scope\n\n---\n\n### Notable Quote (Home Secretary Mahmood)\n> *\"This government has already announced that we will lift the starting point at which most people can receive indefinite leave to remain to ten years.\"*\n\nThis framing suggests the 10-year baseline is a **confirmed policy decision**, with the consultation focused on the surrounding conditions rather than the baseline itself.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#future-settlement-forecast\">\n## Summary: \"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement\" \u2013 UK Government Consultation (November 2025)\n\n### Source & Context\nThis is an official UK Government consultation document (CP 1448), presented to Parliament by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in November 2025, outlining proposed reforms to the UK's settlement (indefinite leave to remain) system.\n\n---\n\n### Core Proposed Changes\n\n**Baseline Qualifying Period:**\n- The government proposes **increasing the standard qualifying period for settlement from 5 years to 10 years** for most applicants.\n- A separate, more stringent **15-year baseline** is proposed for lower-skilled/lower-wage migrants, specifically those who arrived on the Health and Care visa route.\n\n**Mandatory Requirements (non-negotiable):**\n- Clean criminal record (a \"root and branch review\" of criminality thresholds is planned)\n- High standard of English\n- Sustained and measurable economic contribution\n- No debt in the UK\n\n**\"Time Adjustment\" Model (Earned Settlement):**\nThe system is built on four pillars \u2014 **Character, Integration, Contribution, and Residence** \u2014 with modifying factors that can increase or decrease the 10-year baseline:\n- *Reductions* available for: high-talent/high-taxpayer individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers, spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong\n- *Extensions* applied to: those who have claimed benefits, those who entered the country illegally (a \"long penalty\" proposed); refugees on \"core protection\" support face a 20-year path\n- Benefits access proposed to be restricted to those with British citizenship rather than settled status\n\n---\n\n### Scope & Exclusions\n- **Out of scope:** EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) holders, Windrush Scheme grants, those who already hold settled status\n- **Crucially**, the document states the changes would apply to **everyone currently in the UK who has not yet received indefinite leave to remain**, including those who would otherwise have qualified under the old 5-year rule in the near future\n\n---\n\n### Rationale Cited\n- **Forecast settlement volumes:** ~1.6 million people expected to settle between 2026\u20132030, peaking at ~450,000 in 2028, driven largely by 2022\u20132024 immigration (especially Health and Care visas)\n- **Net migration:** 2.6 million additional people between 2021\u20132024\n- **Fiscal concerns:** Migrants on lower wages with non-working dependants are described as presenting \"significant fiscal costs\"\n- **Social cohesion:** The document references public concern about immigration levels and the need to maintain public confidence in the immigration system\n\n---\n\n### Process\n- The consultation runs for **12 weeks** from publication\n- Following consultation, the government will set out its preferred option(s)\n- The Home Secretary indicated (per background information) that changes would come into effect **in April 2026**\n\n---\n\n*Note: This document is a consultation paper, meaning the proposals are not yet enacted law. The final policy may differ from what is outlined here.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx\">\n## Summary: U.K. Leads World in Concern About Migration (Gallup, February 11, 2026)\n\n### Key Statistics\n\n- **21% of Britons** named immigration as their No. 1 national concern in 2025, statistically tied with the economy (23%)\n- This makes the UK **the most concerned country globally** about immigration; the global median is just **1%** across 107 countries\n- UK net migration fell sharply to an estimated **204,000** in the year ending June 2025, down from nearly **650,000** in the year ending June 2024\n- The UK's foreign-born population (17%) is comparable to the US (15%), Norway (18%), and the Netherlands (16%), yet those countries show far lower immigration concern\n\n### Political Breakdown (Gallup polling, 2025)\n\n- **Reform UK supporters**: 48% cite immigration as the biggest problem \u2014 roughly twice the rate of any other major European party's supporters\n- **Conservative supporters**: 23% cite immigration as top concern\n- **Labour supporters**: 16% cite immigration as top concern\n- **Non-aligned UK adults**: 25% cite immigration as top concern \u2014 roughly twice the next highest (Poland and Ireland at 13%)\n\n### Key Predictors of Immigration Concern (Gallup Analysis)\n\nAfter controlling for demographic and attitudinal factors, five key predictors were identified (though not explicitly listed in the extracted text). Notably, **gender, employment status, urban/rural location, personal wellbeing, and actual household income showed no statistically significant relationship** with immigration concern.\n\n### Historical Acceptance vs. Current Concern\n\n- Between 2016\u20132023, UK acceptance of migrants **grew gradually**: by 2023, 80% viewed immigrants as a good thing, 79% were comfortable with an immigrant neighbor, and 75% accepted an immigrant marrying a close relative\n- Gallup suggests concern about immigration as a **national policy issue** can coexist with **personal acceptance of individual migrants**\n\n### Political Implications\n\n- Reform UK, despite holding few parliamentary seats, has been \"setting the political weather\" and attracting Conservative defections\n- The findings highlight a \"balancing act\" for PM Keir Starmer, particularly with local elections on the near-term horizon\n- Reform supporters' outsized focus on immigration could create headwinds for the current government if turnout is high\n\n### Methodology\n\n- Nationally representative samples of ~1,000 adults per country, aged 15+, across **107 countries and territories**\n- Data collected **March\u2013October 2025**\n- Margin of sampling error: **\u00b12.4 to \u00b14.7 percentage points** at the 95% confidence level\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.ippr.org/articles/far-from-settled-the-governments-earned-settlement-consultation\">\n## Summary: IPPR Analysis of UK \"Earned Settlement\" Consultation\n\n**Source:** IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research) \u2014 a left-leaning UK think tank. This is a policy analysis/opinion piece, not a neutral news report.\n\n---\n\n### Core Policy Proposals Under Consultation\n\n- The default qualifying period for settlement would **double from 5 to 10 years**\n- Workers on below-graduate-level roles (including many care workers) would face a **default of 15 years**\n- **Modifying factors** can shorten or lengthen the wait:\n  - High English proficiency: **\u22121 year**\n  - Earning \u00a350,270+ for 3+ years: **\u22125 years**\n  - Claiming benefits: **+5 to 10 years**\n  - Overstaying a visa by 6+ months: **+20 years**\n\n---\n\n### Scale of Impact (IPPR Estimates)\n\n- Approximately **1.35 million people already on routes to settlement** could face the longer default qualifying period\n- Breakdown includes primarily **work route applicants and dependants, plus refugees**\n- **23% (~309,000) are children**, mostly dependants on work routes\n- Most common nationalities affected: **India, Nigeria, and Pakistan**\n- BN(O) visa holders remain on a 5-year default but face new earnings requirements (\u00a312,570+)\n\n---\n\n### IPPR's Key Concerns\n\n1. **Retrospective application is unfair:** Migrants already on settlement routes arrived expecting a 5-year pathway; changing rules mid-journey imposes additional fees, uncertainty, and reduced job flexibility\n2. **Incentive structure doesn't work retroactively:** People already in the UK couldn't have adjusted behavior based on rules that didn't exist when they arrived; prior benefit claims could now penalize them\n3. **Child poverty risk:** Families on low-income work routes (especially former Health and Care route workers) would remain in poverty longer; 309,000 children face 10\u201315 year waits\n4. **Moral consistency concern:** IPPR draws a parallel between retrospective application and Reform UK's proposal to revoke settled status, arguing the government needs \"clear blue water\" between the two positions\n\n---\n\n### IPPR's Recommendation\n\n- The government should introduce a **\"legacy clause\" (grandfathering)** to protect the ~1.35 million people already on routes to settlement from the new rules\n- New rules should apply **only to new entrants**, not those already partway through the settlement process\n\n---\n\n### Methodological Note\n\nIPPR used the **Home Office's Migrant Journey dataset**, focusing on migrants with initial leave from 2021 onward who were still on settlement routes at end of 2024. The analysis covers only default qualifying periods and excludes temporary routes and BN(O) holders. The authors acknowledge data limitations.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible\">\n## Summary: \"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement\" \u2013 UK Government Consultation Document (November 2025)\n\n### Source & Context\nThis is an official UK Government consultation document (CP 1448), presented to Parliament by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in November 2025.\n\n---\n\n### Core Policy Announcement\nThe government has **already announced** (not merely proposed) that the baseline qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain (ILR/settlement) will be **increased from 5 years to 10 years** for most visa categories. The consultation document accompanies this announcement and seeks views on the specific conditions under which settlement can be \"earned.\"\n\n---\n\n### Key Proposed Changes\n\n**Mandatory baseline requirements** (non-negotiable to qualify at any point):\n- Clean criminal record\n- High standard of English\n- Sustained and measurable economic contribution\n- No outstanding debt in the UK\n\n**Factors that could **reduce** the 10-year baseline:**\n- High-talent/high-taxpayer status\n- Senior public service roles\n- Extensive community volunteering\n- Spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong (not subject to consultation)\n\n**Factors that could **extend** beyond 10 years:**\n- Claiming benefits payments\n- Illegal entry (described as a \"long penalty\")\n\n**Special categories:**\n- Refugees on \"core protection\" support: **20-year settlement path**\n- Health and Care visa migrants (lower-wage, with non-working dependants): proposed **15-year baseline**\n- Special consideration for children, armed forces members, and crime victims\n\n---\n\n### Retroactive Application\nThe government proposes applying these new rules to **all current migrants who have not yet received ILR**, including those who were already on track to qualify under the old 5-year rule. Those who have already been granted settled status will **not** be affected.\n\n---\n\n### Rights Upon Settlement\nThe consultation raises the question of whether **benefits access** should be reserved for British citizens rather than those with settled status.\n\n---\n\n### Stated Rationale\n- Net migration of **2.6 million people between 2021\u20132024** (approximately 1 in 30 people currently in the UK)\n- Criticism of the previous Conservative government's lowering of entry bars, particularly the Health and Care visa (intended for 6,000\u201340,000 jobs but resulted in 616,000 arrivals 2022\u20132024, over half being dependants)\n- Concern about social division and public pressure on communities\n- Framing settlement as a **\"privilege to be earned, not a right\"**\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.jobbatical.com/blog/uk-earned-settlement-ilr-updates\">\n## Summary: UK ILR 10-Year Route Changes 2026 (Jobbatical)\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be from a commercial HR/immigration services platform (Jobbatical). While it provides useful operational detail, it should be treated as a secondary source interpreting government policy rather than an official government source.\n\n### Core Policy Changes\nThe article describes an \"earned settlement\" framework now in force, with **implementation from April 2026**:\n- The **baseline qualifying period for ILR has increased to 10 years** for most migrants (up from 5 years on routes like Skilled Worker)\n- The **flexible 10-year long residence route has been abolished** (previously allowed aggregating time across mixed visa categories)\n- ILR is now \"earned\" based on contributions: economic input, English language (B2 level), compliance, and character\n\n### Variable Qualifying Periods\n- **10 years**: baseline for most migrants\n- **Up to 15 years**: roles below RQF level 6 (e.g., some health and care roles)\n- **3\u20135 years**: high earners (\u00a350,270\u2013\u00a3125,140+), top talent, specific public sector roles\n- **20+ years**: cases involving benefit reliance, overstays, or other negative factors\n\n### Policy Drivers\n- Projected ~1.6 million ILR grants between 2026\u20132030 under old rules\n- 2025 Immigration White Paper and \"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement\" consultation (closed February 2026)\n\n### HR/Employer Implications\n- Longer sponsorship periods required, raising retention, cost, and compliance challenges\n- Rules reportedly apply **at the date of ILR application**, potentially affecting those already in the UK\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/remigration-by-stealth-the-governments-earned-settlement-proposals/\">\n## Summary: \"Remigration by stealth?

A public consultation was opened, closing **12 February 2026**, with implementation planned for **April 2026**.\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Baseline Periods\n- **10 years**: Most migrants (up from 5 years)\n- **15 years**: Health and Care visa holders; those in \"medium-skilled\" roles (below RQF level 6)\n- **20 years**: Refugees on the \"core protection\" route\n- **Unchanged at 5 years**: EU Settlement Scheme holders, family members of British citizens, BN(O) visa holders\n- **Unchanged at 3 years**: Global Talent and Innovator Founder routes (accelerated pathways retained)\n\n---\n\n### Four Core Pillars\n1. **Character** \u2013 Criminal record, immigration compliance, public good\n2. **Integration** \u2013 Life in the UK test + English at B2 level (CEFR) or higher\n3. **Contribution** \u2013 Minimum annual earnings above \u00a312,570 for 3\u20135 years\n4. **Residence** \u2013 Continuous lawful residence (no longer sole qualifying basis)\n\n---\n\n### Key Adjustments to Baseline\n\n**Reductions:**\n| Factor | Reduction |\n|---|---|\n| English at C1 level | \u22121 year |\n| Income \u2265\u00a3125,140 for 3 years | \u22127 years |\n| Income \u2265\u00a350,270 for 3 years | \u22125 years |\n| Public service employment (5 years) | \u22125 years |\n| Community/volunteer work | \u22123 to 5 years |\n| Parent/partner/child of British citizen | \u22125 years |\n| BN(O) route holder | \u22125 years |\n| Global Talent/Innovator Founder (3 years) | \u22127 years |\n\n**Increases:**\n| Factor | Addition |\n|---|---|\n| Public funds received <12 months | +5 years |\n| Public funds received >12 months | +10 years |\n| Illegal entry (e.g., small boat) | +up to 20 years |\n| Entry on visit visa | +up to 20 years |\n| Overstay \u22656 months | +up to 20 years |\n\n---\n\n### Dependants\nSettlement periods for dependants will be assessed **independently** based on their own attributes, potentially resulting in different qualifying timelines than the main applicant. The consultation will address how children are accommodated given contribution-based requirements may be inappropriate for them.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Timeline\n- Consultation closed: **12 February 2026**\n- Planned implementation: **April 2026**\n- Rules expected to apply to **anyone not already holding settlement** at the date changes take effect\n- Government consulting on **transitional arrangements** for those already on settlement pathways\n\n---\n\n### Employer Guidance Highlighted\nThe article advises employers to: engage with the consultation; identify employees currently eligible for settlement and **bring applications forward before April 2026**; review salary structures; budget for higher long-term sponsorship costs; and provide legal advice access to affected employees.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Trace legislative progress and current status of the UK Home Office \u201cEarned Settlement\u201d proposal that would increase the baseline qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain to ten years, including any published draft Immigration Rules, statutory instruments, or commencement orders scheduled before May 2026, plus analysis by immigration law firms and Hansard records up to February 2026.\n1. Chronology and legislative vehicles to-date  \n\u2022 12 May 2025 \u2013 \u201cRestoring Control over the Immigration System\u201d White Paper presented to the Commons (Hansard, Immigration System debate, 12 May 2025).  The White Paper trailed replacement of the five-year residence norm with a default 10-year requirement and the abolition of the current 10-year \u201clong residence\u201d route.  \n\u2022 20 Nov 2025 \u2013 Written ministerial statement \u201cMigration: Settlement Pathway\u201d by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced a formal consultation, confirmed Government intent to begin implementation in April 2026, and indicated that most changes can be delivered by amending the Immigration Rules rather than primary legislation (KPMG summary; Hansard 20 Nov 2025).  \n\u2022 20 Nov 2025 \u2013 Home Office published \u201cA Fairer Pathway to Settlement \u2013 Earned Settlement\u201d consultation paper (closing 23:59 GMT, 12 Feb 2026).  The paper sets out the draft policy architecture, mandatory requirements, the 10-year baseline (15 years for below-RQF-6 roles, 20 years for most refugees) and the \u201ctime-adjustment\u201d discounts/penalties (KPMG; All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration; Womble Bond Dickinson).  \n\u2022 12 Feb 2026 \u2013 Consultation closed.  Law Society, Free Movement and many sector bodies filed critical submissions on gender impact, retrospective application and business uncertainty (VisaHQ 5 Feb 2026; VisaHQ 12 Feb 2026).  \nNo draft Immigration Rules (normally laid as \u201cStatement of Changes in Immigration Rules\u201d, HC number) have yet been published, and no statutory instruments or commencement orders have been laid before either House.  The Home Office explicitly states that final Rules will be laid \u201cafter we have considered consultation responses\u201d with a target \u201cin time for April 2026 implementation\u201d (consultation p. 3).  Consequently, as at 18 Feb 2026 the proposal remains at pre-legislative (consultation) stage.\n\n2. Substance of the proposal likely to be converted into Immigration Rules  \nMandatory requirements (apply to every applicant)  \n\u2022 Suitability: tightened criminality thresholds; no outstanding public debts.  \n\u2022 Integration: English at B2 CEFR (up from B1) and Life in the UK Test.  \n\u2022 Contribution: taxable earnings \u2265 \u00a312,570 for 3\u20135 years (subject to consultation).  \n\u2022 Residence: lawful, continuous residence, but residence alone is no longer sufficient (APPG; Morgan Lewis).  \n\nBaseline qualifying periods  \n\u2022 10 years \u2013 default for most economic migrants (Skilled Worker at RQF 6+; family routes).  \n\u2022 15 years \u2013 Skilled Workers in roles below RQF 6 and certain care-sector roles.  \n\u2022 20 years \u2013 refugees outside Government resettlement routes; plus penalties for benefit claimants.  \n\u2022 Unaffected five-year routes \u2013 partners of British citizens, BN(O), Windrush, EUSS.  \n\u2022 Accelerated three-year route retained for Global Talent and Innovator Founder (minus 7-year discount).  \n\nTime-adjustment factors (only the biggest positive and negative applied):  \nReductions: taxable earnings \u00a3125,140 (-7 yrs) or \u00a350,270 (-5 yrs); five years in specified public service (-5 yrs); high-level English C1 (-1 yr); verified volunteering (-3-5 yrs).  \nIncreases: receipt of public funds < 12 months (+5 yrs) or \u2265 12 months (+10 yrs); illegal arrival/visit-visa entry/overstay 6+ months (up to +20 yrs).  \n(Full tables in APPG, KPMG and consultation.)\n\nDependants  \nEach adult partner must qualify in their own right; timelines can diverge.  Children may either settle with parents during a \u201cspecific window\u201d or transition to an individual pathway at 18 (Morgan Lewis).  \n\nTransitional arrangements  \nGovernment \u201cpreference\u201d is none: anybody who has not obtained ILR by the commencement date would switch to the earned settlement regime (consultation p. 27).  Employers, law firms and NGOs argue this is unlawful or disproportionate and will trigger litigation (Lewis Silkin, \u201ctransitional arrangements\u201d, 18 Dec 2025; IPPR 2026).  \n\n3. Parliamentary scrutiny prospects 2026  \nBecause settlement rules sit in the Immigration Rules, changes are subject to the negative resolution procedure: they are laid at least 21 parliamentary days before coming into force and become law unless either House passes a motion to annul.  That procedure offers limited opportunity for amendment, but intensive political pressure could force revisions or phased transition.  If the Government chooses to adjust fees, an Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order\u2014an affirmative statutory instrument\u2014would also be required.  No such SI appears on the forthcoming business of either House up to 18 Feb 2026.  \n\n4. Commentary from practitioners, think-tanks and employers  \n\u2022 Business impact \u2013 sponsors face further four to ten years of visa fees, Immigration Skills Charge and IHS (\u2248 \u00a310k\u2013\u00a314k per five-year extension) and retention risk (Lewis Silkin 18 Feb 2026; Womble Bond Dickinson example of Architect: \u00a311,696 extra cost).  \n\u2022 Labour-market concerns \u2013 care-sector and hospitality employers warn of intensified shortages as 15-year wait deters recruits (VisaHQ 5 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Equality and discrimination \u2013 Free Movement and the Law Society highlight adverse impact on women (career breaks/part-time), disabled workers and low-paid groups; potential breach of Equality Act 2010 and Art. 14 ECHR (VisaHQ 5 Feb 2026; Law Society 12 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Children and higher education \u2013 IPPR estimates 309,000 children already in the system would face longer waits, raising access-to-tuition-fee issues and family instability (IPPR \u201cFar from settled\u201d, Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Legitimate expectation litigation \u2013 lawyers note the 2009 HSMP Forum precedent and warn of judicial review if rules apply retrospectively (Lewis Silkin \u201ctransitional arrangements\u201d 18 Dec 2025).  \n\u2022 International competitiveness \u2013 tech, life-sciences and professional-services bodies say Canada and Australia are offering faster permanent residency, risking UK talent drain (VisaHQ 12 Feb 2026).\n\n5. Current status vis-\u00e0-vis resolution question  \nAs of mid-February 2026:  \n\u2022 The Government remains committed, on the record, to raising the baseline qualifying period from five to 10 years.  \n\u2022 The measure has progressed from White Paper to consultation; no binding legislation has yet been laid.  \n\u2022 Implementation is slated for \u201cApril 2026\u201d, leaving little time for parliamentary scrutiny and for employers or migrants to lodge pre-change ILR applications.  \nTherefore the qualifying period in law is still five years, but the pathway to a 10-year baseline is clearly advanced and on the Government\u2019s forward programme.  The decisive events to watch are: (i) publication of a Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (likely numbered HC xxx of 2026) between late February and late March 2026; (ii) any associated Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2026; (iii) possible transitional provisions inserted into the Rules or a commencement order fixing the precise date (expected 6 April 2026 in line with the tax year).  \n\n6. Information gaps  \n\u2022 No draft Rules or statutory instruments yet available; details of precise wording, transitional clauses, fee levels and commencement date remain unknown.  \n\u2022 No updated impact assessment published since the November 2025 statement.  \n\u2022 No formal government response to consultation (due \u201cwithin six weeks\u201d, i.e., by late March 2026).  Until that response is published, final policy choices on earnings thresholds, volunteering criteria and below-RQF-6 treatment are unconfirmed.  \n\nIn sum, all publicly available evidence up to 18 February 2026 shows the \u201cEarned Settlement\u201d reform is on track but not yet enacted.  Parliament has not yet had the opportunity to vote on\u2014or annul\u2014the necessary Immigration Rules instrument, and key operational details, including transitional protection, could still shift in the next two months.</Agent_report>\n"
