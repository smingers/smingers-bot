The consultation on increasing the baseline to 10 years was **open** (not yet enacted) as of the article's publication. The data on grant volumes by category would be relevant to the fine print condition about which visa categories represent the **majority of grants**.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain#:~:text=You%20must%20usually%20have%20lived%20and%20worked%20in%20the%20UK%20for%205%20years\">\n## Summary: UK Indefinite Leave to Remain \u2013 GOV.UK\n\n**Note:** This is a general informational page from GOV.UK about eligibility for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). The content appears to reflect the **current rules** and does not reference any proposed changes to the qualifying period.\n\n### Key Facts from the Article:\n\n**Standard Qualifying Periods (Current Rules):**\n- **Most work visas:** 5 years of living and working in the UK\n- **Tier 1 visa:** 2 or 3 years (depending on type)\n- **Innovator Founder or Global Talent visa:** 3 years\n- **UK Ancestry visa:** 5 years\n- **Long residence route:** 10 years or more of continuous residence (this is an *existing* separate pathway, not a new proposal)\n\n**Other Routes to ILR:**\n- Family members of British citizens or those with ILR (route varies by visa type)\n- EU/EEA/Swiss citizens may apply under the **EU Settlement Scheme** for settled status instead\n- Some Commonwealth citizens may have **right of abode**\n- Windrush scheme eligibility for some individuals\n\n**What ILR Provides:**\n- Right to live, work, and study in the UK indefinitely\n- Eligibility to apply for benefits (if otherwise eligible)\n- Pathway to apply for **British citizenship**\n\nThe article makes **no mention** of the proposed increase to a 10-year baseline qualifying period under the new \"earned settlement\" consultation.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#:~:text=a\\\">\n## Summary: \"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement\" \u2013 UK Government Consultation (November 2025)\n\n### Source & Context\nThis is an official UK Government consultation document (CP 1448), presented to Parliament by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in November 2025, outlining proposed reforms to the UK's settlement (indefinite leave to remain) system.\n\n---\n\n### Core Proposal\nThe government has **already announced** (described as a done decision, not merely proposed) that the baseline qualifying period for settlement will be **increased from 5 years to 10 years**. The consultation concerns the *conditions* under which settlement can be earned, not whether the 10-year baseline will be implemented.\n\n---\n\n### Key Facts & Statistics\n\n- **Net migration 2021\u20132024**: approximately 2.6 million people (~1 in 30 current UK residents arrived in this four-year period)\n- **Health and Care visa arrivals 2022\u20132024**: 616,000 individuals (over half were dependants, not workers)\n- **Forecast settlement grants 2026\u20132030**: ~1.6 million people, peaking at ~450,000 per year in 2028\n- **Current baseline**: 5 years for most visa categories; criminal sentence threshold of over 1 year\n\n---\n\n### Proposed \"Earned Settlement\" Framework\n\nThe new model is built on **four core pillars**:\n1. **Character** \u2013 Clean criminal record required (no ability to offset); full review of criminality thresholds underway\n2. **Integration** \u2013 Demonstrated meaningful engagement with British society\n3. **Contribution** \u2013 Sustained, measurable economic contribution\n4. **Residence** \u2013 Lawful, continuous residence (residence alone will not normally qualify)\n\n### Time Adjustment Model\n- **Baseline**: 10 years (up from 5)\n- **Accelerated settlement** possible for: high-talent/high-taxpaying individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers\n- **Faster settlement** (not subject to consultation): spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong\n- **Delayed settlement** for: benefit claimants, those who entered the UK illegally (20-year path for refugees on \"core protection\" support)\n\n---\n\n### Additional Consultation Options\nThe document consults on three specific options to reduce forecast settlement volumes:\n- **(a)** Increasing baseline qualifying period to **10 years**\n- **(b)** Increasing qualifying period to **15 years** for Skilled Workers in roles below RQF Level 6 (below bachelor's degree level)\n- **(c)** Implementing a **No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF)** condition at settlement\n\nA **separate 15-year baseline** is proposed specifically for lower-wage Health and Care visa migrants who bring non-working dependants.\n\n---\n\n### Retroactivity\nThe government proposes applying these changes to **all current migrants who have not yet received indefinite leave to remain** \u2014 meaning those currently on track for settlement under the old 5-year rule would be subject to the new requirements once immigration rules change. Those who **already hold** settled status are explicitly excluded from any changes.\n\n---\n\n### Scope Exclusions\n- EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) \u2013 out of scope\n- Windrush Scheme grants \u2013 out of scope\n- Those already holding settled status \u2013 out of scope\n\n---\n\n### Notable Quote (Home Secretary Mahmood)\n> *\"This government has already announced that we will lift the starting point at which most people can receive indefinite leave to remain to ten years.\"*\n\nThis framing suggests the 10-year baseline is a **confirmed policy decision**, with the consultation focused on the surrounding conditions rather than the baseline itself.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#future-settlement-forecast\">\n## Summary: \"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement\" \u2013 UK Government Consultation (November 2025)\n\n### Source & Context\nThis is an official UK Government consultation document (CP 1448), presented to Parliament by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in November 2025, outlining proposed reforms to the UK's settlement (indefinite leave to remain) system.\n\n---\n\n### Core Proposed Changes\n\n**Baseline Qualifying Period:**\n- The government proposes **increasing the standard qualifying period for settlement from 5 years to 10 years** for most applicants.\n- A separate, more stringent **15-year baseline** is proposed for lower-skilled/lower-wage migrants, specifically those who arrived on the Health and Care visa route.\n\n**Mandatory Requirements (non-negotiable):**\n- Clean criminal record (a \"root and branch review\" of criminality thresholds is planned)\n- High standard of English\n- Sustained and measurable economic contribution\n- No debt in the UK\n\n**\"Time Adjustment\" Model (Earned Settlement):**\nThe system is built on four pillars \u2014 **Character, Integration, Contribution, and Residence** \u2014 with modifying factors that can increase or decrease the 10-year baseline:\n- *Reductions* available for: high-talent/high-taxpayer individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers, spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong\n- *Extensions* applied to: those who have claimed benefits, those who entered the country illegally (a \"long penalty\" proposed); refugees on \"core protection\" support face a 20-year path\n- Benefits access proposed to be restricted to those with British citizenship rather than settled status\n\n---\n\n### Scope & Exclusions\n- **Out of scope:** EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) holders, Windrush Scheme grants, those who already hold settled status\n- **Crucially**, the document states the changes would apply to **everyone currently in the UK who has not yet received indefinite leave to remain**, including those who would otherwise have qualified under the old 5-year rule in the near future\n\n---\n\n### Rationale Cited\n- **Forecast settlement volumes:** ~1.6 million people expected to settle between 2026\u20132030, peaking at ~450,000 in 2028, driven largely by 2022\u20132024 immigration (especially Health and Care visas)\n- **Net migration:** 2.6 million additional people between 2021\u20132024\n- **Fiscal concerns:** Migrants on lower wages with non-working dependants are described as presenting \"significant fiscal costs\"\n- **Social cohesion:** The document references public concern about immigration levels and the need to maintain public confidence in the immigration system\n\n---\n\n### Process\n- The consultation runs for **12 weeks** from publication\n- Following consultation, the government will set out its preferred option(s)\n- The Home Secretary indicated (per background information) that changes would come into effect **in April 2026**\n\n---\n\n*Note: This document is a consultation paper, meaning the proposals are not yet enacted law. The final policy may differ from what is outlined here.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx\">\n## Summary: U.K. Leads World in Concern About Migration (Gallup, February 11, 2026)\n\n### Key Statistics\n\n- **21% of Britons** named immigration as their No. 1 national concern in 2025, statistically tied with the economy (23%)\n- This makes the UK **the most concerned country globally** about immigration; the global median is just **1%** across 107 countries\n- UK net migration fell sharply to an estimated **204,000** in the year ending June 2025, down from nearly **650,000** in the year ending June 2024\n- The UK's foreign-born population (17%) is comparable to the US (15%), Norway (18%), and the Netherlands (16%), yet those countries show far lower immigration concern\n\n### Political Breakdown (Gallup polling, 2025)\n\n- **Reform UK supporters**: 48% cite immigration as the biggest problem \u2014 roughly twice the rate of any other major European party's supporters\n- **Conservative supporters**: 23% cite immigration as top concern\n- **Labour supporters**: 16% cite immigration as top concern\n- **Non-aligned UK adults**: 25% cite immigration as top concern \u2014 roughly twice the next highest (Poland and Ireland at 13%)\n\n### Key Predictors of Immigration Concern (Gallup Analysis)\n\nAfter controlling for demographic and attitudinal factors, five key predictors were identified (though not explicitly listed in the extracted text). Notably, **gender, employment status, urban/rural location, personal wellbeing, and actual household income showed no statistically significant relationship** with immigration concern.\n\n### Historical Acceptance vs. Current Concern\n\n- Between 2016\u20132023, UK acceptance of migrants **grew gradually**: by 2023, 80% viewed immigrants as a good thing, 79% were comfortable with an immigrant neighbor, and 75% accepted an immigrant marrying a close relative\n- Gallup suggests concern about immigration as a **national policy issue** can coexist with **personal acceptance of individual migrants**\n\n### Political Implications\n\n- Reform UK, despite holding few parliamentary seats, has been \"setting the political weather\" and attracting Conservative defections\n- The findings highlight a \"balancing act\" for PM Keir Starmer, particularly with local elections on the near-term horizon\n- Reform supporters' outsized focus on immigration could create headwinds for the current government if turnout is high\n\n### Methodology\n\n- Nationally representative samples of ~1,000 adults per country, aged 15+, across **107 countries and territories**\n- Data collected **March\u2013October 2025**\n- Margin of sampling error: **\u00b12.4 to \u00b14.7 percentage points** at the 95% confidence level\n</QuestionSource>\n"
