Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Euronews (Feb 19, 2026)**: High-quality mainstream European news outlet. Reports divergent polling: independent polls show Tisza +7 to +16 points; government-linked polls show Fidesz +7 to +10. Factual reporting on methodology disputes. Current and directly relevant.

2. **Polymarket (as of Feb 20, 2026)**: Prediction market with $19.7M volume. Magyar at 56%, Orbán at 42% for next PM. Strong signal from aggregated crowd wisdom with financial incentives. Moderate-high quality for directional signal, though banned in Hungary limiting local participation.

3. **Polit Pro (polling aggregator, ~Feb 2026)**: Aggregates polls showing TISZA at 45.2%, Fidesz at 41.7%. Projected seats: TISZA 99, Fidesz 89, Mi Hazánk 11. Key factual claim: neither party near 133-seat threshold in current projections. Moderate quality — methodology not fully transparent.

4. **Hungarian Conservative (Nov 2025)**: Pro-Fidesz outlet. Useful for Fidesz perspective and Trump-Orbán alliance context. Factual: Trump gave Hungary permanent exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian energy. Biased source — opinions should be discounted.

5. **SafeAbroad (Aug 2025)**: Security analysis firm. Factual: LGBTQ ban passed April 2025, 100,000+ attended Pride March, protests increasing. Notes these increased Tisza support. Moderate quality, indirect relevance.

6. **Daily News Hungary (Feb 2026)**: Reports Tisza appointing foreign policy chief. Key expert opinion from political scientist Gábor Török: government-friendly polls show Fidesz heading toward "hefty majority, if not quite a supermajority." Moderate quality.

7. **La Razón / UNIAN (Feb 20, 2026)**: Reports Fidesz AI campaign video controversy. Factual: Tisza leads at 50% vs Fidesz 37% in cited poll. Campaign tactics suggest Fidesz is on the defensive. Moderate quality.

8. **DW (Dec 10, 2025)**: Credible mainstream outlet. Reports Hungary passed constitutional amendment (134-49 vote) raising threshold to remove president. Key expert opinion from TISZA: Fidesz fears losing power. Factual confirmation that Fidesz still held supermajority as of December 2025 (134 votes cast in favor). High quality.

9. **Eurotopics (Feb 19, 2026)**: Aggregates European media analysis. Key factual point: "dismantling Orbán's power structures requires more than a parliamentary majority; a constitutional majority is needed." Confirms Tisza's supermajority ambitions but notes difficulty. High quality synthesis.

10. **Various Russian/Ukrainian sources (Dec 2025-Feb 2026)**: Mixed quality. Russian sources (rossaprimavera, 24tv.ua, AiF) report Tisza leading or tied with Fidesz. One analyst (Trukhachev) predicts Fidesz wins but loses majority. Moderate quality for factual polling data, low quality for analysis.

11. **Times of Israel FR / ProtoThema (Jan 2026)**: Mainstream outlets. Confirm Tisza leading at ~50% vs Fidesz ~35% in independent polls. Factual: Fidesz held supermajority in all four previous elections. High quality.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**

1. **Structural electoral system advantages for Fidesz** (multiple sources, direct causal mechanism): The winner compensation system, gerrymandering, and rural vote weighting consistently convert ~45%+ vote shares into 133+ seats. This is a structural/institutional factor difficult to change. In 2014 (44.5%), 2018 (49%), 2022 (53.5%), Fidesz achieved exactly 133-135 seats. This is the single most important factor. *Shifts toward Yes.*

2. **Historical base rate: 3/3 post-2014 elections produced supermajority** (multiple credible sources): Every election under the current system has produced a Fidesz supermajority. *Shifts toward Yes.*

3. **Independent polls consistently show Tisza leading by 7-16 points** (multiple independent pollsters — Medián, Závecz, IDEA, 21 Research Centre): If Fidesz is genuinely at 33-40%, they likely fall below 133 seats. The Polit Pro aggregate projects Fidesz at only 89 seats. *Shifts toward No.*

4. **Expert consensus that Tisza cannot achieve supermajority** (multiple analysts): Even with a commanding lead, Tisza would need ~55-57% to reach 133 seats. This means "Yes" resolution depends almost entirely on Fidesz retaining supermajority. *Neutral — narrows the question.*

**Moderate evidence:**

5. **Government-linked polls show Fidesz at 49-51% among committed voters** (Center for Fundamental Rights, HSRI, Nézőpont): If accurate, Fidesz comfortably retains supermajority. These pollsters have government contracts but the Center for Fundamental Rights ranked 3rd most accurate in 2024 EP elections. *Shifts toward Yes.*

6. **DW report: Fidesz still held 134 votes in December 2025** (direct factual): As recently as December 2025, Fidesz could pass constitutional amendments with 134 votes, confirming they still held the supermajority in parliament. This is the status quo going into the election. *Shifts toward Yes (status quo).*

7. **Polymarket: Magyar at 56%, Orbán at 42%** ($19.7M volume): Strong signal that informed bettors expect a change in government. If Magyar wins, Tisza almost certainly won't have a supermajority (experts say impossible). This implies the market expects NO supermajority. *Shifts toward No.*

8. **2022 polling miss**: Independent polls were substantially wrong in 2022 (Publicus off by ~20 points). This suggests independent polls may be overstating Tisza's lead. *Shifts toward Yes.*

9. **Economic deterioration, EU fund freeze, scandals**: Cumulative 50%+ inflation, €18-20B EU funds withheld, child protection scandals. These are genuine headwinds for Fidesz. *Shifts toward No.*

**Weak evidence:**

10. **Trump-Orbán alliance**: Permanent exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian energy. May boost Fidesz's "peace" narrative. *Slight shift toward Yes.*

11. **Fidesz AI campaign video controversy**: Suggests Fidesz is using fear-based tactics, possibly indicating internal awareness of weakness. *Slight shift toward No.*

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The election is April 12, 2026 — approximately 51 days from now. The question resolves April 13, 2026. This is a very short window with relatively stable polling trends.

- **If timeframe halved (~25 days)**: Prediction would be essentially the same — polls are stable and structural factors are fixed.
- **If timeframe doubled (~100 days)**: More uncertainty; Fidesz could potentially recover or a new scandal could emerge. Prediction might shift slightly toward uncertainty (closer to 50%).

The short timeframe means current polling is highly informative. No major structural changes to the electoral system are expected before April 12.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting point**: Outside view base rate of 55% (Fidesz retaining supermajority).

**Key adjustments**:

1. The structural system is the most important factor. Fidesz needs only ~45% to secure 133 seats. The critical question is whether Fidesz is at 45%+ or below.

2. The polling divergence is stark: independent polls put Fidesz at 33-40%; government-linked polls put them at 46-51%. The truth likely lies somewhere between these extremes.

3. The 2022 precedent (polls off by ~20 points) is important but shouldn't be overweighted — that was a specific election with a fragmented opposition. The 2026 opposition is unified under a single strong candidate.

4. Expert Gábor Török's observation that both Nézőpont and 21 Research Centre measure Tisza at ~35%, with the divergence entirely in Fidesz support (28% vs 40%), is crucial. This suggests Tisza's support is more reliably measured at ~35%, and the uncertainty is about Fidesz's true support level.

5. If Fidesz is truly at ~40-43%, the structural system might still deliver them 120-130 seats but not 133+. The supermajority threshold is a knife's edge.

6. The Polit Pro seat projection (Fidesz 89 seats) is based on independent poll aggregates and likely overstates Tisza's advantage due to the 2022 polling miss pattern.

7. The December 2025 constitutional vote (134-49) confirms Fidesz still held its supermajority in parliament just 2 months ago. The status quo is "supermajority exists."

8. Government-linked polls (which have some track record) suggest Fidesz at 49-51% among committed voters — comfortably above the ~45% threshold for supermajority.

**Net assessment**: The structural advantages and historical base rate push toward Yes. The independent polling data (showing Fidesz at 33-40%) and prediction markets (favoring Magyar) push toward No. The 2022 polling miss suggests independent polls may be overstating Tisza's lead by 5-15 points. If we split the difference and assume Fidesz is at ~43-46%, they're right at the supermajority threshold — making this genuinely uncertain.

I'll adjust my outside view prediction slightly downward from 55% to approximately 48%, reflecting:
- The unprecedented strength of the opposition polling lead (even accounting for likely overstatement)
- The prediction market signal (Polymarket at 42% for Orbán as PM, implying even lower probability of supermajority)
- Expert consensus that even government-friendly analysts acknowledge a supermajority is uncertain ("hefty majority, if not quite a supermajority")
- The economic headwinds are real and sustained

However, I'll keep it above 45% because:
- Structural advantages are real and historically decisive
- Government-linked polls (with some track record) show Fidesz at 49-51%
- The 2022 polling miss precedent
- Status quo is "supermajority exists"

**Final estimate: 47%**

**Probability Calibration**

The question resolves Yes if any party gets 133+ seats. Tisza achieving this is near-impossible (experts say needs ~55-57%). So this is essentially: "Does Fidesz retain 133+ seats?"

The structural system is powerful but not invincible at 33-40% vote shares. The true Fidesz support is likely 40-47% (splitting the polling gap). At 40-43%, they likely fall below 133. At 44-47%, they likely retain it. The probability distribution over this range suggests roughly 45-50% chance of supermajority.

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria**: Will any party/coalition get ≥133 seats in the April 12, 2026 Hungarian election? This essentially means: does Fidesz-KDNP retain its supermajority? ✓

2. **Base rate**: 3/3 post-2014 elections = 100% base rate, discounted to 55% for unprecedented opposition strength. Final prediction of 47% represents further downward adjustment. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "47 out of 100 times, a party achieves a supermajority in the 2026 Hungarian election." This aligns with my analysis — genuinely uncertain, slight lean toward No given polling environment, but structural advantages keep it competitive. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - Structural electoral system converts ~45%+ into supermajority (strong, Yes)
   - Independent polls show Fidesz at 33-40% (strong, No)
   - Government-linked polls show Fidesz at 49-51% (moderate, Yes)
   - 2022 polling miss precedent (moderate, Yes)
   - Polymarket/prediction markets favor Magyar (moderate, No)

5. **Blind spot**: If the 2022 polling miss repeats and Fidesz is actually at 48-50%, they easily retain the supermajority and my 47% prediction looks too low. Conversely, if independent polls are more accurate this time (unified opposition, better methodology), Fidesz falls to 120-125 seats and my prediction looks too high.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is "Fidesz holds supermajority" (confirmed December 2025). A slight nudge toward status quo might push prediction to 50-52%. I'll maintain 47% given the weight of independent polling evidence.

Probability: 47%
