Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **NYT/Krugman Blog (Kim Lane Scheppele, 2014)**: Academic expert analysis of Hungary's winner compensation system. High quality for understanding structural mechanics, though dated (2014). Factual explanation of how the system magnifies plurality wins into supermajorities.

2. **Institute of Geoeconomics (October 2025)**: Analysis of Hungary's electoral system and 2026 prospects. Reasonably credible think-tank source. Key factual points: late 2024 redistricting, potential pre-election rule changes, and warnings from analyst Róbert László about possible systemic changes.

3. **Freedom House 2022**: Credible democracy watchdog. Factual: 2018 Fidesz-KDNP won exactly 133 seats on 49.3% of the vote. Confirms structural advantages.

4. **IFES Election Guide**: Neutral, factual electoral data. Confirms 133 seats = ⅔ threshold; 2018 result was exactly 133 seats.

5. **The Nation (February 17, 2026)**: Left-leaning publication, but cites identifiable experts (András Bíró-Nagy of Policy Solutions, Zoltan Fleck of ELTE). Key expert opinion: Tisza needs 4+ point margin to overcome structural disadvantages; 10-point margin to force Fidesz out. Describes Tisza leading by double digits in some polls. Current and relevant.

6. **DW News (February 2026)**: Mainstream news outlet. Reports Tisza won ~30% in June 2024 EP elections; most independent polls show Tisza with significant lead. Credible, current.

7. **Hungarian Conservative (February 17, 2026)**: Conservative/pro-Fidesz outlet citing Center for Fundamental Rights (government-linked think tank). Potentially biased. Reports Fidesz-KDNP at 49% vs Tisza at 42% among committed voters. The institute ranked 3rd most accurate in 2024 EP elections.

8. **Agent Report**: Synthesizes multiple sources. Key factual data: 2014 (133 seats, ~44.5% vote), 2018 (134 seats, 49%), 2022 (135 seats, 53.5%). February 2026 polling: independent polls show Tisza +7 to +16 points; government-linked polls show Fidesz +7 to +10. Expert consensus: Fidesz needs ~45%+ to retain supermajority; Tisza would need ~55-57% for its own supermajority.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are relevant:

1. **Fidesz supermajority in post-2014 elections**: 3/3 elections (2014, 2018, 2022) resulted in Fidesz supermajority. Base rate = 100%. However, this is a small sample and current conditions are meaningfully different (Fidesz trailing in most independent polls).

2. **Incumbent governments with structural electoral advantages retaining supermajorities**: In systems designed to favor incumbents, supermajorities are sticky. But when the incumbent faces a 10+ point deficit in independent polls, the probability drops significantly.

3. **Opposition achieving supermajority in a system designed against them**: Historically near-zero. Even in the most favorable opposition polling scenarios, analysts say Tisza cannot reach 133 seats.

4. **Elections where any party achieves supermajority**: The most relevant class. In Hungary's post-2014 system, every election has produced a supermajority for Fidesz. The question is whether this continues.

The most suitable reference class is #4 combined with #1: "Has any party achieved a supermajority in Hungary's post-2014 electoral system?" — 3/3 times, always Fidesz.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The election is April 12, 2026 — approximately 51 days from now (February 20, 2026). This is a very short window; polling trends are relatively stable. The question resolves April 13, 2026.

Historical patterns: In 2014, 2018, and 2022, Fidesz secured supermajorities. The structural system (winner compensation, gerrymandering, rural vote weighting) consistently converts ~45-54% vote shares into 133-135 seats. The current situation is genuinely different: independent polls show Tisza leading by substantial margins.

**(d) Justification**

The key question is: will **any** party/coalition reach 133 seats?

**Path to Yes (Fidesz retains supermajority)**:
- Government-linked polls (Center for Fundamental Rights, HSRI) show Fidesz at 49-51% among committed voters
- Historical precedent: 3/3 post-2014 elections produced Fidesz supermajority
- Structural advantages: gerrymandering, winner compensation, rural vote weighting, media dominance, 100:1 spending advantage
- At ~45%+ vote share, the system almost automatically delivers ≥133 seats
- Publicus (opposition-leaning pollster) missed 2022 by 20 points, consistently underpolling Fidesz
- Trump/Rubio endorsement may boost Fidesz internationally

**Path to No (no supermajority)**:
- Independent polls (Medián, Závecz, IDEA, 21 Research Centre) show Tisza leading by 7-16 points
- If Fidesz falls to low-40s%, they likely still win most seats but may fall below 133
- Economic deterioration (50% cumulative inflation, €20B+ EU funds withheld), major scandals
- Tisza has unified the entire opposition for the first time
- Expert consensus: even if Fidesz loses the popular vote, Tisza cannot reach 133 seats (would need ~55-57%)
- The question resolves "Yes" only if Fidesz retains supermajority OR Tisza achieves one — the latter is essentially impossible per expert analysis

**Assessment**:
The "Yes" outcome depends almost entirely on Fidesz retaining 133+ seats. Tisza achieving a supermajority is near-impossible given structural constraints.

The polling picture is genuinely split: government-linked polls favor Fidesz by 7-10 points (suggesting supermajority likely), while independent polls favor Tisza by 7-16 points (suggesting Fidesz might fall below 133 seats). 

Given that:
- The 2022 election showed independent polls were substantially wrong (Publicus off by 20 points)
- The structural system strongly favors converting ~45% vote shares into supermajorities
- Fidesz has won supermajorities in all three post-2014 elections
- But the current opposition lead in independent polls is historically unprecedented and the economic/scandal context is genuinely different
- Expert Bíró-Nagy says Tisza needs 10-point margin to force Fidesz out of power entirely, suggesting even a 7-10 point Tisza lead might not be enough to deny Fidesz a simple majority, but it might be enough to deny the supermajority
- The 133-seat threshold is the critical margin — Fidesz could win 120-130 seats and still lose the supermajority

I estimate the probability of a supermajority (essentially = Fidesz retaining 133+ seats) at roughly 52-58%. The structural advantages are real and historically decisive, but the current polling environment and economic conditions create genuine uncertainty.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate from 2014-2022 is 3/3 = 100% for supermajority. However, this small sample from a system designed to produce supermajorities must be discounted given:
- Unprecedented opposition unity
- Fidesz trailing in most independent polls
- Economic deterioration

The structural system means Fidesz needs only ~45% to secure 133 seats. Government-linked polls show them at 49-51%; independent polls show them at 33-40%. The truth likely lies somewhere in between. If Fidesz is truly at ~43-45%, they're right at the supermajority threshold. If at 48-50%, they comfortably clear it.

Given the historical base rate (100%), structural advantages, but accounting for the genuinely competitive environment and the possibility that independent polls are partially correct, I estimate ~55% probability of a supermajority.

Outside View Prediction:
55%
