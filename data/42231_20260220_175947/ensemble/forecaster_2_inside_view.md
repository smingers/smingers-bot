Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Euronews (Feb 19, 2026)** – "Hungary polls split on April election outcome" – High-quality international broadcaster. Factual: Independent polls show Tisza leading (Medián: 40% vs 33%; Závecz: 49% vs 39%; IDEA: +8pp; 21 Research: +7pp). Government-linked polls show Fidesz ahead (Nézőpont: 46% vs 40%; CFR: 49% vs 42%; HSRI: 51% vs 41%). Expert opinion from named political scientists (Török, Tóka, Tóth) is credible. Methodological dispute is real and documented.

2. **Polymarket (prediction market)** – Shows Magyar at 56%, Orbán at 42% for next PM. $19.7M volume is substantial. Prediction markets aggregate information efficiently but can be manipulated or reflect thin liquidity. Moderate quality indicator; directionally useful.

3. **Polit Pro (polling aggregator, ~Feb 2026)** – Shows TISZA at 45.2%, Fidesz at 41.7%. Seat projection: TISZA 99, Fidesz 89, Mi Hazánk 11. No party near 133 seats. Methodology not fully transparent but aggregation approach is reasonable. Moderate-high quality.

4. **Hungarian Conservative (Nov 2025)** – Pro-Fidesz editorial stance. Factual content: Trump-Orbán meeting, U.S. sanctions exemption, Kari Lake/RFE investigation. Opinion framing is partisan. Use only factual elements.

5. **SafeAbroad (Aug 2025)** – Reports LGBTQ+ ban, constitutional amendment passed April 2025, large protests. Factual. Notes protests increased Tisza support. Moderate quality.

6. **Daily News Hungary (Feb 2026)** – Reports Tisza naming foreign policy chief. Factual. Notes political scientist Török warning Orbán victory "fiendishly difficult." Government-friendly polls suggest Fidesz heading toward "hefty majority, if not quite a supermajority." Moderate quality.

7. **AskNews articles (Feb 19-20, 2026)** – Multiple sources: Fidesz AI campaign video controversy; Orbán blaming Ukraine for pipeline disruption; Tisza leading 50% vs Fidesz 37% in some polls (Reuters cited); DW article on constitutional amendment to protect presidency (passed 134-49, meeting supermajority threshold as recently as Dec 2025). Various quality levels; La Razón, UNIAN, DW are credible.

8. **Deutsche Welle (Dec 10, 2025)** – Reports Hungary passed constitutional bill 134-49 (supermajority). Factual confirmation that Fidesz still held its supermajority as of December 2025. High quality.

9. **Eurotopics (Feb 19, 2026)** – Synthesis of European media coverage. Notes that dismantling Orbán's power requires constitutional majority. Factual. High quality.

10. **Antena3/Times of Israel FR/ProtoThema (Jan 2026)** – Multiple sources confirming Tisza leads ~50% vs Fidesz ~35% in independent polls. Consistent across sources. Moderate-high quality.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**

1. **Polling consensus showing a competitive race** – Multiple independent, named pollsters (Medián, Závecz, IDEA, 21 Research Centre) consistently show Tisza ahead by 7-16pp among decided voters. Government-linked pollsters show Fidesz ahead by 7-10pp. The divergence is real and documented. This is the most important evidence: *neither party is polling near the ~45-50% vote share needed for a supermajority under the current system*. Even Fidesz's most favorable polls (51% from HSRI) might yield a supermajority; most independent polls suggest Fidesz is well below that threshold.

2. **Seat projection from Polit Pro** – Fidesz projected at 89 seats, Tisza at 99 seats, Mi Hazánk at 11. Neither party near 133. This is a direct structural calculation based on current polling. Strong evidence against supermajority for either party.

3. **Fidesz held supermajority as recently as December 2025** (DW: 134-49 vote) – Confirms Fidesz still had 134+ seats at that point. But this is the *current* parliament, not the post-election one.

4. **Electoral system structural bias** – The winner-compensation mechanism magnifies plurality-winner's seat share. Under the 2011 rules, 3/3 elections produced supermajorities for Fidesz. This is a structural factor. However, the bias works *only when one party dominates the district races*. If Tisza wins most districts, the bias would work for them—but they'd need to win enough districts to reach 133.

**Moderate evidence:**

5. **Fidesz's structural advantages** – Gerrymandering, state media dominance, diaspora votes (ethnic Hungarians abroad who vote heavily Fidesz), and "winner compensation" all favor Fidesz. These are real but partially offset by a genuinely competitive opposition.

6. **Mi Hazánk likely to cross 5% threshold** – Multiple sources confirm this. This means the vote is split three ways, making it harder for either Fidesz or Tisza to dominate districts. This *reduces* the probability of a supermajority for either party.

7. **Polymarket: Magyar 56%, Orbán 42%** – Prediction market with substantial volume. Implies meaningful probability of Tisza winning, but says nothing directly about supermajority.

8. **Expert opinion (Gábor Török)** – Named political scientist notes the race is genuinely competitive. The Daily News Hungary source notes government-friendly polls suggest Fidesz heading toward "hefty majority, if not quite a supermajority."

**Weak evidence:**

9. **Fidesz AI campaign video controversy** – Suggests Fidesz is on the defensive, using fear-based tactics. Weak indicator of electoral outcome.

10. **Trump-Orbán alignment** – Could boost Fidesz's image domestically. Speculative effect on vote share.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **52 days** until election (Feb 20 → Apr 12, 2026).
- At this timeframe, Hungarian elections have historically shown minimal late swings (≤2pp median since 2010).
- If timeframe were **halved** (~26 days): Polling would be even more predictive; current trends would be more locked in. The probability of a supermajority would be roughly similar or slightly lower (less time for Fidesz to recover).
- If timeframe were **doubled** (~104 days): More uncertainty; Fidesz could potentially recover or Tisza could surge further. The probability distribution would widen.
- The 52-day window is short enough that the current polling picture is highly informative.

**(d) Justification and Inside View**

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate = 73% (blending 100% from 3/3 elections under current system with broader authoritarian-incumbent class ~75%, then applying discounts for unprecedented polling environment).

**Key adjustments:**

1. **Polling evidence is the most powerful current signal.** The Polit Pro seat projection (Fidesz: 89, Tisza: 99, Mi Hazánk: 11) directly addresses the resolution criteria. If accurate, *neither party* reaches 133 seats. This is a direct, quantitative projection. However, I must account for:
   - Government-linked polls showing Fidesz at 49-51% (which *could* translate to a supermajority under winner-compensation)
   - The structural bias that has consistently amplified Fidesz's seat share
   - The possibility that Fidesz's "mobilizable inactive supporters" (200-300K per Nézőpont) could close the gap

2. **The critical question: Can Fidesz reach ~45% vote share?** Under the current system, Fidesz achieved supermajorities with 44.87% (2014), 49.27% (2018), and 54.13% (2022). Independent polls show Fidesz at 33-40%; government-linked polls show 40-51%. The true figure is likely somewhere in between, but the weight of evidence suggests Fidesz is below the ~45% threshold needed for a supermajority.

3. **Can Tisza reach a supermajority?** Tisza is polling at 40-50% in various surveys. Even if Tisza gets 45-50% of the vote, the winner-compensation mechanism would work in their favor IF they win most single-member districts. However: (a) Fidesz's gerrymander favors Fidesz in rural districts; (b) Mi Hazánk splitting the right-wing vote could actually *help* Tisza win more districts; (c) Tisza's urban concentration could hurt them in district-based contests. The Polit Pro projection (Tisza: 99 seats) suggests even a Tisza win wouldn't reach 133.

4. **The "no supermajority" scenario is now the modal outcome.** Most credible projections suggest a competitive election where neither party reaches 133 seats. The December 2025 constitutional amendment vote (134-49) confirms Fidesz still had its supermajority in the *current* parliament, but this doesn't predict the post-election composition.

5. **Structural factors that could still produce a Fidesz supermajority:**
   - Diaspora votes (ethnic Hungarians abroad vote overwhelmingly for Fidesz, ~95%)
   - State media dominance may not be fully captured in polls
   - Winner-compensation amplification if Fidesz wins most rural districts even with ~40% national vote
   - Potential late mobilization of 200-300K inactive Fidesz supporters

6. **Structural factors against any supermajority:**
   - Mi Hazánk splitting right-wing vote in districts (hurts Fidesz district wins)
   - Tisza's lead in independent polls is consistent and has been stable since spring 2025
   - Even government-linked polls (most favorable to Fidesz) show Fidesz at 49-51%, which historically *might* produce a supermajority but is not guaranteed

**Probability recalibration:**

- Base rate: 73%
- Adjustment 1: Seat projection directly shows neither party near 133 → **-20pp** (strong evidence, direct calculation)
- Adjustment 2: Government-linked polls showing Fidesz at 49-51% could still produce supermajority via winner-compensation → **+5pp**
- Adjustment 3: Mi Hazánk splitting right-wing vote reduces Fidesz district wins → **-3pp**
- Adjustment 4: Structural advantages (diaspora, state media, gerrymander) partially offset polling deficit → **+3pp**
- Adjustment 5: Small chance Tisza achieves supermajority (Polit Pro shows 99 seats; would need ~34 more) → **+2pp**

Net adjustment: -13pp → **73% - 13% = 60%**

Wait—let me reconsider. The Polit Pro seat projection is based on current polling averages, but:
- It shows Fidesz at 89 seats (far from 133)
- It shows Tisza at 99 seats (far from 133)
- For Fidesz to reach 133, it would need to gain ~44 more seats than projected, which would require a massive polling error or late swing
- For Tisza to reach 133, it would need ~34 more seats than projected

The polling error required for a supermajority is substantial. In 2022, Fidesz got 54.13% and 135 seats. Current independent polls show Fidesz at 33-40%—a gap of 14-21pp from 2022. Even government-linked polls show 40-51%, still below 2022 levels.

However, the winner-compensation mechanism is powerful. In 2022, Fidesz won 135 seats with 54.13%. In 2018, Fidesz won 133 seats with 49.27%. So the threshold for a supermajority is roughly 49% vote share. Government-linked polls showing 49-51% for Fidesz are right at this threshold.

The key uncertainty is: which polls are right? If government-linked polls are accurate (Fidesz ~49-51%), a supermajority is plausible. If independent polls are accurate (Fidesz ~33-40%), a supermajority is nearly impossible.

Given the documented bias of government-linked pollsters and the convergence of multiple independent pollsters, I weight independent polls more heavily. But I can't dismiss government-linked polls entirely.

**Revised estimate:**
- P(Fidesz supermajority | government polls accurate) ≈ 55% (49-51% vote share is borderline)
- P(Fidesz supermajority | independent polls accurate) ≈ 5% (33-40% vote share is far below threshold)
- P(Tisza supermajority) ≈ 3% (would need massive structural advantage reversal)
- P(government polls accurate) ≈ 25% (given documented bias, but some possibility)
- P(independent polls accurate) ≈ 75%

P(supermajority) = 0.25 × 0.55 + 0.75 × 0.05 + 0.03 = 0.1375 + 0.0375 + 0.03 = **~20%**

This seems too low given the base rate of 73%. Let me reconcile.

The base rate of 73% was established before seeing the current polling data. The current data is *strongly* informative and represents an unprecedented situation (first time in 16 years that credible polls show Fidesz potentially losing). The reference class of "3/3 supermajorities under current system" is no longer analogous because in all three prior elections, Fidesz polled at 45%+ in *all* polls, including independent ones.

The current situation is genuinely different: independent polls consistently show Fidesz at 33-40%, which has never happened before under the current system. This makes the reference class non-analogous and warrants a larger shift from the base rate.

**Final calibration:**

I'll weight the structural/historical base rate at 30% and the current polling evidence at 70%:
- Structural base rate contribution: 0.30 × 0.73 = 0.219
- Current evidence contribution: 0.70 × 0.20 = 0.140
- Combined: ~36%

Rounding and considering uncertainty: **~30-35%**

I'll settle on **30%** as my inside view prediction, reflecting:
- The unprecedented polling environment strongly suggesting neither party will reach 133 seats
- The structural advantages that could still help Fidesz (but are insufficient to overcome a 10-15pp polling deficit)
- The small but non-trivial chance that government-linked polls are more accurate
- The tiny chance Tisza achieves a supermajority

---

**Probability Calibration:**

The outside view base rate of 73% was derived from a small sample (3/3 elections) and a broader authoritarian-incumbent class. The current evidence strongly suggests this election is fundamentally different from 2014, 2018, and 2022:

1. Independent polls consistently show Fidesz 10-15pp below its 2022 performance
2. Seat projections directly show neither party near 133 seats
3. Mi Hazánk splitting the right-wing vote reduces district wins for Fidesz
4. Even government-friendly analysts acknowledge Fidesz may not reach a supermajority

The probability of a supermajority is substantially lower than the base rate suggests. I estimate **30%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will any party/coalition win ≥133 of 199 seats in the April 12, 2026 Hungarian parliamentary election?

2. **Base rate:** 73% (3/3 under current system, blended with broader class). Current evidence warrants significant downward revision.

3. **Consistency check:** "30 out of 100 times, a party wins ≥133 seats in the 2026 Hungarian election." This makes sense given polling shows neither party near that threshold, but structural factors and polling uncertainty leave meaningful probability.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Polit Pro seat projection: Fidesz 89, Tisza 99, Mi Hazánk 11 (no party near 133) ✓
   - Independent polls: Fidesz 33-40%, well below ~49% threshold for supermajority ✓
   - Government polls: Fidesz 49-51%, borderline for supermajority ✓
   - Mi Hazánk likely above 5%, splitting right-wing district votes ✓
   - Fidesz held 134+ seats as recently as Dec 2025 (current parliament, not predictive of April result) ✓

5. **Blind spot:** If government-linked polls are accurate and Fidesz mobilizes its inactive supporters (200-300K), Fidesz could reach 49%+ and win a supermajority via winner-compensation. This scenario would make a 30% forecast look too low.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo is that Fidesz *currently* holds a supermajority (confirmed Dec 2025 vote). But the question is about the *post-election* parliament. The trend is clearly toward a more competitive election. A slight nudge toward the historical status quo (supermajority) is warranted given the structural advantages, but the polling evidence is too strong to ignore.

Probability: 30%
