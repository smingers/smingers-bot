Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **NYT/Krugman Blog (Kim Lane Scheppele, Feb 2014)**: Academic expert explaining Hungary's winner-compensation mechanism. High quality for structural understanding of the electoral system. Historical context only.

2. **Institute of Geoeconomics (Oct 2025)**: Analysis of Hungary's electoral system and 2026 prospects. Discusses potential pre-election reforms. Moderate quality; identifies real structural concerns but some speculation about reform scenarios.

3. **Freedom House (2022)**: Credible democracy watchdog. Confirms Fidesz won exactly 133 seats in 2018 with 49.3% of the vote. High factual reliability.

4. **IFES Election Guide (2022)**: Factual electoral data. Confirms 133 seats = two-thirds threshold. High reliability.

5. **The Nation (Feb 17, 2026)**: Journalistic piece describing Tisza leading by double digits. Notes structural advantages for Fidesz. Moderate quality; left-leaning outlet but cites named experts (Bíró-Nagy, Fleck). Key expert opinion: Tisza needs 4+ point margin to overcome structural disadvantages, 10+ points to force Fidesz out.

6. **DW News (Feb 2026)**: Reports Tisza won ~30% in 2024 EP elections and leads in independent polls. Reliable news source.

7. **Hungarian Conservative (Feb 17, 2026)**: Pro-government outlet citing Center for Fundamental Rights poll: Fidesz 49% vs Tisza 42% among committed voters. Partisan bias risk, but the institute ranked 3rd most accurate in 2024 EP elections.

8. **Agent Report**: Comprehensive synthesis. Key facts: Fidesz won 133, 134, 135 seats in 2014, 2018, 2022 respectively. February 2026 polls split: opposition-leaning polls show Tisza +7-16 points; government-linked polls show Fidesz +7-10 points. Concludes Fidesz path to supermajority is plausible if their vote share is ~45%+, but opposition supermajority is remote.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

**Reference class 1: Hungarian parliamentary elections since 2014 (under current system)**
- 2014: Fidesz-KDNP won 133 seats (supermajority) ✓
- 2018: Fidesz-KDNP won 134 seats (supermajority) ✓
- 2022: Fidesz-KDNP won 135 seats (supermajority) ✓
- Base rate: 3/3 = 100% supermajority achieved

This is highly relevant but a small sample. The structural system strongly favors the leading party achieving supermajority once they're above ~45% of the vote.

**Reference class 2: Elections where incumbent faces strong opposition challenge**
When incumbents face genuine competitive threats, outcomes become less predictable. The 2026 election appears genuinely competitive in a way 2014-2022 were not.

**Reference class 3: Authoritarian-leaning incumbents in competitive elections**
Orbán-style systems have structural advantages that often preserve power even when facing significant popular opposition. However, when opposition unifies and leads by large margins, incumbents can lose (e.g., Poland 2023).

The most suitable reference class is #1 (Hungarian elections under current system) adjusted for the unprecedented competitive environment.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The election is April 12, 2026 — approximately 51 days from now (question opened Feb 20, 2026). This is a short timeframe; major polling shifts are possible but unlikely to be dramatic. The campaign is already underway.

Historical patterns: In 2014, 2018, 2022, Fidesz consistently converted ~44-54% of the vote into 133-135 seats. The winner-compensation mechanism is the key amplifier. The structural threshold appears to be approximately 45% of the national vote for Fidesz to secure supermajority.

**(d) Justification**

The core question is whether **any** party/coalition reaches 133 seats. In practice, this means: will Fidesz-KDNP retain their supermajority, or will Tisza achieve one (the latter being extremely unlikely)?

**For Fidesz supermajority:**
- Structural advantages: gerrymandering, winner-compensation, media dominance, 100:1 spending advantage, rural vote weighting
- Historical precedent: 3/3 elections resulted in supermajority
- Government-linked polls show Fidesz at 49% (well above the ~45% threshold)
- US support (Trump endorsement, Rubio visit) may bolster Fidesz internationally
- The electoral system is specifically designed to convert plurality wins into supermajorities

**Against Fidesz supermajority:**
- Independent polls show Tisza leading by 7-16 points — if accurate, Fidesz would fall below the ~45% threshold needed
- Economic grievances (50% cumulative inflation, EU funds withheld) are real
- Opposition is more unified than in any previous election
- Expert Bíró-Nagy says Tisza needs only 4+ point margin to overcome structural disadvantages
- If Fidesz falls to ~38-40% of the vote, they likely lose the supermajority even with structural advantages

**For Tisza supermajority:**
- Essentially impossible at current polling levels; would need ~55%+ of the vote
- Probability: <3%

**Key uncertainty**: The massive divergence between government-linked polls (Fidesz +7-10%) and independent polls (Tisza +7-16%) creates enormous uncertainty. The truth likely lies somewhere in between, given that opposition-leaning pollster Publicus missed 2022 by 20 points, while Center for Fundamental Rights was accurate in 2024 EP elections.

The 2024 EP elections (Tisza ~30%, Fidesz ~44%) provide a recent data point. Since then, Tisza has grown but so has uncertainty. If the true Fidesz vote share is ~44-46%, they likely still achieve supermajority. If it's ~38-42%, they likely don't.

Given:
- 3/3 historical supermajority rate
- Structural system advantages
- But genuinely competitive polling environment
- Uncertainty about which polls are accurate
- The threshold (~45% for Fidesz) is achievable but not guaranteed

I estimate roughly 55-60% probability that Fidesz achieves supermajority, and ~2-3% for Tisza supermajority, giving approximately 57-63% overall probability of any supermajority.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate from Hungarian elections under the current system is 100% (3/3). However, this election is unprecedented in its competitiveness. The structural advantages are real but the polling divergence is significant.

Adjusting from 100% base rate:
- Discount for genuine competitive threat: -25 to -30%
- Discount for possibility that independent polls (showing Tisza lead) are more accurate: -10%
- Small addition for Tisza supermajority possibility: +2%

This yields approximately 62-67% probability.

The key tether: if Fidesz's true vote share is at or above 45%, historical precedent strongly suggests supermajority. The probability that Fidesz is at or above 45% given the polling divergence is roughly 55-65%.

Outside View Prediction:
62%
