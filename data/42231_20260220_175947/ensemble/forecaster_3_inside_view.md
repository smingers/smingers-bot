Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Resolves Yes if, in Hungary’s first parliamentary election after 2026-02-20 (scheduled 2026-04-12), any party/coalition wins ≥133 of 199 seats (a 2/3 supermajority) per official results.

2) Outside view base rate
Outside view previously established: 62% (anchored on Fidesz–KDNP’s 3/3 supermajorities under the post-2011 system, but discounted for unprecedented competitiveness).

(a) Source analysis (what each source says + quality/date)
- Euronews (2026-02-19): Reports stark poll divergence: independent pollsters often show Tisza leading; government-linked pollsters show Fidesz leading. Names multiple firms and quotes identifiable experts (Török, Tóka). High usefulness for “range of polling reality,” but not a clean estimate.
- Polymarket market (access-restricted in Hungary; 2026-02-20 snapshot): Magyar favored ~56% vs Orbán ~42% for PM. Useful as a sentiment/aggregation signal; can be noisy/manipulable and not directly about seat supermajority. Moderate quality.
- PolitPro polling aggregate (undated but “~50 days before election,” consistent with mid/late Feb 2026): Aggregates polls to Tisza ~45%, Fidesz ~42%, and projects seats: Tisza 99, Fidesz 89, Mi Hazánk 11. Helpful as an attempted “best guess,” but methodology/inputs not fully transparent here. Moderate quality.
- Hungarian Conservative (2025-11-11): Pro-Fidesz framing; claims Trump support/energy sanction exemptions reduce EU leverage. Mostly opinion, partisan. Low-to-moderate for electoral inference; more relevant to campaign context than seat math.
- SafeAbroad (2025-08-13): On protest dynamics and restrictive laws; plausible but not a direct election-forecasting source. Moderate for “mobilization/conflict” context; weak for seat outcome.
- DailyNewsHungary (date not shown, but “three months before election”): Tisza personnel move; includes claim that gov-friendly polls imply “hefty majority, if not quite supermajority.” Secondary reporting; moderate/low.
- AskNews: La Razón (2026-02-20): Sensational campaign-video controversy; likely based on Reuters-style reporting but it’s still mostly campaign color. Weak-to-moderate for marginal vote effects.
- AskNews: Dialog.ua / UNIAN (2026-02-19/20): Claims about Druzhba pipeline and war messaging; partisan/war-information environment; weak for quantified election forecasting.
- AskNews: InfoWars (2026-02-19): Highly unreliable outlet; disregard for forecasting.
- AskNews: eurotopics (2026-02-19): Meta-summary of European commentary; low evidentiary value for seat threshold.
- AskNews: ProtoThema/Times of Israel FR (2026-01): General election setup + “Tisza ~50, Fidesz ~35” narrative; plausible but not as precise as named pollsters; moderate.
- DW (2025-12-10): Notes constitutional change passed with 134 votes and that a future 2/3 is “unlikely in near term.” DW is reliable; however that “unlikely” is an expert/journalistic judgment, not a model. Moderate.

Bottom line on sources: The strongest actionable inputs are (i) the broad polling range (Euronews) and (ii) the poll-aggregate central tendency (PolitPro) plus (iii) the structural electoral fact that ~45–50% can yield 2/3 via district sweeps and winner-compensation.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- Structural/institutional: Hungary’s mixed system with winner-compensation + 106 FPTP districts can magnify the top party; historically enabled 2/3 with ~49% (2018). This increases supermajority plausibility if one party is clearly ahead.
- Historical pattern under same rules: Fidesz–KDNP achieved 2/3 in 2014/2018/2022. Baseline pull toward “Yes,” conditional on being the clear #1.

Moderate evidence
- Current polling central estimate suggests a tight race rather than a dominant party: PolitPro trend ~Tisza 45 vs Fidesz 42 with projected seats far below 133 for either. If that’s close to truth, a supermajority becomes unlikely.
- Poll divergence itself (Euronews): implies high uncertainty; also suggests potential house effects/political pressure. This widens the distribution—raising tail risk of a lopsided outcome (either direction) but lowering confidence in “status quo Fidesz 2/3.”

Weak evidence
- Campaign controversies (AI execution video) and pipeline/war messaging: could move a few points at most; unclear direction; short time left.
- Geopolitical narratives (Trump/EU leverage): plausible second-order effects, but hard to map to seat supermajority.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: ~51 days until the April 12, 2026 election.
- If timeframe were halved (~25 days left): less time for big swings; I’d lean more on current aggregates → lower supermajority probability than today.
- If timeframe were doubled (~100 days left): more room for shocks, coordination failures, turnout/mobilization surprises, or rule/administrative changes → I’d raise supermajority probability somewhat (more tail risk).

(d) Justification (updating from outside view to inside view)
The outside view (62%) leaned heavily on “under these rules, the winner often gets 2/3.” The inside view adjustment hinges on whether 2026 looks like those prior elections (clear dominant Fidesz) or like a competitive two-bloc contest where the leading party is only marginally ahead.

Key update versus the 2014–2022 reference class: credible indicators (poll aggregates + multiple independent pollsters as cited by Euronews) suggest Fidesz may no longer be near/above the ~45% zone that historically makes 2/3 feasible. A ~42–45% vs ~45–49% split (Tisza slightly ahead) implies:
- Many constituencies become competitive rather than safely swept by a single party.
- FPTP seat bonuses and winner-compensation still help the top party, but to reach 133 seats you typically need something closer to a broad district sweep—harder in a near-even national environment.

So, I’m shifting down materially from 62%: the most likely seat outcomes under a close popular vote are “simple majority or plurality leading to coalition/negotiation,” not “2/3 for either side.”

Probability calibration
- Status quo if trends continue (tight race; Tisza slight edge): No supermajority is the modal outcome.
- Paths to Yes:
  1) Fidesz rebounds to ~46–49% effective vote and wins a large majority of the 106 districts (plus compensation seats) → plausible, but no longer the central scenario.
  2) Tisza not only wins but wins big (high-40s/low-50s) and sweeps districts → possible but less likely given structural headwinds and current dispersion.
- Paths to No:
  - Either party leads by only a few points; district map splits; Mi Hazánk (and possibly others) take list seats; winner’s seat bonus insufficient for 133.

Given the polling center-of-gravity implying neither side near a “dominant-party” vote share, but acknowledging Hungary’s system can produce big seat bonuses and that polling is unusually contested, I land at a sub-50 but not tiny “Yes.”

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Yes if any party/coalition wins ≥133 seats in Hungary’s first post-2026-02-20 parliamentary election (expected 2026-04-12).
2) Outside view base rate: 62%.
3) Consistency check: 43 out of 100 times, a party/coalition wins ≥133 seats.
4) Top evidence (≤20 words each):
   - Poll-aggregate projects seats far below 133 for both (PolitPro: 99/89/11).
   - Multiple independent polls show Tisza leading; government polls show Fidesz near 50 (Euronews).
   - Electoral system can magnify a clear winner into 2/3, but needs a district sweep.
   - Prediction market favors government change, indirectly reducing Fidesz-2/3 likelihood (Polymarket).
5) Blind spot: Polls are systematically wrong and Fidesz quietly sweeps districts again → supermajority returns; would push probability up.
6) Status quo outcome: With a tight race, most likely outcome is no 2/3; nudges forecast downward.

Probability: 43%
