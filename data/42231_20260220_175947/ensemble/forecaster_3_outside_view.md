Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis

1) **NYT/Krugman blog (Kim Lane Scheppele), Feb 2014**
- **What it says (facts/claims):** Describes Hungary’s post-2011 electoral rules, emphasizing the unusual “winner compensation” feature that adds surplus votes for *winners* into list tallies, amplifying the leading party’s seat share; also notes institutional reconfiguration of election bodies.
- **What is opinion/interpretation:** The argument that the system was *deliberately engineered* to yield supermajorities for Fidesz in a fragmented-opposition context; assessment of fairness/administrative concerns.
- **Quality & date:** High-quality analyst (named academic) with strong explanatory value for mechanism design; dated (2014) but still relevant because the institutional logic persists.

2) **Institute of Geoeconomics/Asia Pacific Initiative, Oct 2025**
- **What it says:** Summarizes the mixed system (106 SMD + 93 list), highlights gerrymandering, single-round plurality in SMDs, winner compensation, and notes past/potential reforms (e.g., abolishing winner compensation or moving to pure PR).
- **Opinion vs fact:** Institutional descriptions are largely factual; claims about intentional advantage and future reform scenarios are interpretive/speculative.
- **Quality & date:** Moderately useful; think-tank style and could have framing bias, but the mechanical descriptions align with widely reported features.

3) **Freedom House “Freedom in the World 2022” (Hungary)**
- **What it says:** Gives 2018 results (Fidesz-KDNP 49.3% vote; 133 seats = 2/3) and summarizes OSCE-type integrity concerns and structural incumbency advantages.
- **Opinion vs fact:** Election results are factual; democracy/backsliding assessment is evaluative but comes from a reputable watchdog.
- **Quality & date:** High credibility for general context; not tailored to 2026.

4) **IFES Election Guide (2022 election page)**
- **What it says:** Factual electoral system parameters (thresholds, seat tiers, d’Hondt) and 2018 seat totals.
- **Opinion vs fact:** Mostly factual.
- **Quality & date:** High for rules/definitions; limited analytic value.

5) **The Nation, Feb 17, 2026**
- **What it says:** Narrative that Fidesz faces unusually strong challenge; includes expert quotes (e.g., Bíró-Nagy, Fleck) about what margins might be needed to overcome structural tilt.
- **Opinion vs fact:** Many interpretive judgments; some factual claims (inflation, scandals) but presented in advocacy-journalism style.
- **Quality & date:** Useful for “expert belief distribution,” but politically framed; not ideal as a neutral baseline source.

6) **DW News, Feb 2026**
- **What it says:** Straight news summary of campaign launch; mentions Tisza’s prior EP result and general polling direction without hard numbers.
- **Opinion vs fact:** Mostly factual reporting; limited quantitative substance.
- **Quality & date:** Generally reliable mainstream outlet; good but not decisive.

7) **Hungarian Conservative, Feb 17, 2026 (Center for Fundamental Rights poll)**
- **What it says:** Reports a poll showing Fidesz ahead among committed voters; includes claims about pollster accuracy and political spin.
- **Opinion vs fact:** The poll topline is a claim contingent on methodology; strong editorial slant; the interpretation is partisan.
- **Quality & date:** Low-to-moderate reliability due to alignment with pro-government ecosystem; still informative as one data point about possible polling-house bias.

8) **Agent report (compiled summary)**
- **What it says:** Assembles historical seat outcomes (2014/2018/2022) and summarizes a spread of Feb 2026 polls; adds heuristic “rules of thumb” about seat conversion.
- **Opinion vs fact:** The historical seat/vote figures are plausibly factual but should be verified; heuristics and seat implications are analytic extrapolations.
- **Quality & date:** Useful synthesis, but as a secondary compilation (and partially model-derived), it warrants skepticism—especially on precise poll numbers and seat heuristics unless independently cross-checked.

**Bottom line from sources for outside-view purposes:** The strongest “outside view” evidence is the *repeated empirical outcome* under the post-2011 system: a leading party with mid-to-high 40s vote share can realistically reach 133 seats due to SMD dominance + winner compensation, especially when the opposition is not perfectly coordinated.

### (b) Reference class analysis

Candidate reference classes:

1) **Hungarian parliamentary elections under the current 199-seat, winner-compensation system (2014, 2018, 2022).**
- **Suitability:** Very high. Same electoral formula, same seat threshold (133), similar incumbency advantages. Directly answers how often a 2/3 happens *in this system*.
- **Observed frequency:** 3 out of 3 elections (2014/2018/2022) produced a governing 2/3.

2) **Hungarian elections since 2010 (including 2010 under old rules).**
- **Suitability:** Moderate. Adds one more data point (2010) but under different rules (386 seats, two-round system etc.), so less comparable mechanically.
- **Observed frequency:** 4 out of 4 elections produced a governing 2/3.

3) **European parliamentary democracies generally (incidence of 2/3 majorities).**
- **Suitability:** Low. Hungary is an outlier; importing Europe-wide base rates would understate the probability given Hungary’s specific institutional amplifiers.

4) **“Competitive authoritarian / dominant-party” electoral systems with mixed rules (e.g., Serbia-like patterns).**
- **Suitability:** Medium. Captures dynamics of a tilted field and repeated large seat bonuses, but country specifics differ.

**Chosen reference class:** **(1) Hungary 2014/2018/2022 under current rules**—best match to the resolution criterion.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Time until outcome:** From **2026-02-20 to 2026-04-12** is ~**7 weeks (51–52 days)**.
- **Outside-view implication of short horizon:** With <2 months left, the “rules of the game” are mostly set, and the main uncertainty is voter alignment/mobilization and tactical coordination across SMDs. Historically, in many elections, large structural seat-bonus patterns don’t disappear late; they’re features of the conversion mechanism.
- **Pattern over similar periods:** In systems with strong mechanical amplification (FPTP components + gerrymander + compensation rules that favor winners), the key determinant is whether one bloc wins *enough* SMDs. That tends to be stable unless there is (i) a major late-breaking scandal, (ii) opposition coordination failure/success, or (iii) a rule change.

### (d) Justification (outside view)

Using the most relevant reference class (Hungary 2014/2018/2022 under current rules), the empirical base rate of a 2/3 supermajority is **3/3 = 100%**. That is an extremely high raw rate, but it’s based on a **small sample** and on a period dominated by one unusually durable governing coalition.

Still, the mechanism described by Scheppele and echoed in later summaries provides a structural explanation for why this base rate can be high: **SMD plurality wins + winner compensation + districting** can convert a vote share in the **mid-to-high 40s** into **≥133 seats**. That makes a supermajority outcome substantially more plausible in Hungary than in typical European PR systems.

On the other hand, an outside-view forecaster should **regress away from 100%** because:
- The next election could be the first in this system with a genuinely unified, highly competitive challenger (a regime-cycle turning point risk).
- Even if a party/coalition wins, **the margin** may be narrower than in 2022, and the 2/3 threshold is knife-edge (133 is the minimum).
- Upsets and “near misses” are common in politics when dominance erodes; a dominant party can retain power but lose a supermajority, or vice versa.

Given that “any party or coalition” could in principle achieve 2/3, the event probability is dominated by whether the leading bloc (historically Fidesz-KDNP) again converts its advantage into **≥133** seats; an opposition 2/3 is mechanically possible but historically unprecedented in this era and would generally require an even more lopsided seat sweep than merely winning.

So the outside-view baseline should be: **supermajority is more likely than not**, but not close to certainty.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether to rough figures:** The best tether is the **historical frequency under identical rules (3/3)** plus the institutional argument that the system can yield 2/3 at ~45–50% vote.
- **Adjust for small-sample and upset risk:** Going from a raw 100% to something like **~65–80%** seems appropriate: high because of strong structural amplification and repeated precedent, but meaningfully below certainty because regime-change elections do happen and the threshold is tight.
- **Upset/variance rate in comparable domains:** Electoral outcomes often surprise; even robust incumbencies sometimes fall short of supermajority thresholds without losing outright. That argues against >85% absent extremely stable dominance.

I’ll center the outside-view probability in the low-to-mid 70s: high, but leaving substantial mass for “no supermajority” as a plausible deviation from the 2014–2022 pattern.
