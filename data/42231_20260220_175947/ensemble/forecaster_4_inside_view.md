Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological & condensed)

• Euronews (20 Feb 2026, independent, EN): collates ten recent polls, distinguishes government-linked vs independent houses; methodology transparent; fresh and relevant.  – Mostly facts (poll toplines); opinions confined to quoted analysts.  – High quality, Strong recency.

• Polymarket board (20 Feb 2026 snapshot): on-chain prediction market, $20 m volume.  – Indicates crowd-priced 57 % chance of Magyar becoming PM.  – Market prices are data but not direct evidence; moderate quality, high recency.

• PolitPro poll aggregate (≈18 Feb 2026): algorithmic average of public polls; gives vote+seat projection (Tisza 99, Fidesz 89).  – Factual summariser; decent transparency.  – Moderate quality.

• AskNews packet (18-20 Feb 2026, multiple European outlets): AI-video scandal, Druzhba-pipeline row, protest mood, etc.  – Hard news items; factual core is campaign climate & latest polls (most independents show Tisza +8-12 pts, govt-linked show opposite).  – Quality varies; treat as moderate.

• Hungarian Conservative (pro-Fidesz, 11 Nov 2025): flags Trump support, Fidesz “still on track”.  – Clear partisan bias; use only for claims with outside corroboration.  – Low-to-moderate.

• DW (10 Dec 2025): reports last-minute constitution tweak passed 134–49.  – Verifies Fidesz still has 2/3 today; demonstrates ease of using it.  – High quality, though two months old.

• Structural-rule sources (Scheppele 2014; IFES guide; Freedom House 2022): document winner-compensation, 106 SMDs, 93 list, 133-seat threshold.  – All factual, strong evidence, albeit older.

2. Evidence analysis (strength tags)

Strong:
• Electoral system mechanically turns 45-50 % vote share into 2/3 of seats (three consecutive elections 2014-22) – structural, historic.
• Fidesz still controls district maps, state media, and electoral bodies – hard to change before April.

Moderate:
• Independent February polls place Fidesz mid-30s to low-40s and trailing Tisza by 8-12 pts – suggests <45 % vote share.
• Government-aligned polls show Fidesz 49-51 % among decided voters – implies supermajority is still arithmetically reachable.
• Prediction market gives only 42 % chance Orbán stays PM – implies lower than historic probability of Fidesz victory at all.

Weak:
• Campaign controversies (AI fear video, Druzhba narrative) could move swing voters but magnitude uncertain.
• Possible late rule tweaks or counting disputes; precedent exists but frequency unknown.

3. Timeframe analysis
Days until polls close: 52.  Opinion swings >5 pts are unlikely but not unheard-of.  If the horizon were halved (26 d) I’d trim “Yes” by ~3 pts (less time for Fidesz turnout machine).  If doubled (104 d) I’d add ~4 pts (more scope for rule changes & mobilisation surprises).

4. Justification / outside→inside shift
Outside-view base (post-2011 elections): 3/3 supermajorities ⇒ 72 %.  
Inside-view downward adjustments:
a) First election since 2010 with a single, cohesive opposition party polling ahead (–20 %).
b) Independent poll aggregate puts Fidesz ≈41 % vote share, below the critical 45 % supermajority band (–12 %).
c) Prediction markets and most foreign analysts rate regime-change >50 % (–6 %).
Upward offsets:
d) Incumbent still commands media, money, gerrymander; has history of outperforming late (+4 %).
e) Government-poll scenario (≈50 % vote) would yield supermajority with ~80 % likelihood (+3 %).

Net inside-view = 72 % – 20 – 12 – 6 + 4 + 3 ≈ 41 %.  Rounded and slight subjective tempering → 38 %.

Scenario tree (simplified):
• Fidesz vote ≥49 % (p≈30 %) ⇒ 0.8 supermaj.  => 24 %
• Fidesz vote 45–48 % (p≈20 %) ⇒ 0.4 supermaj.  => 8 %
• Opposition supermajority path (p≈20 % vote ≥50 %) ⇒ 0.05 supermaj. => 1 %
Residual/irregularities ⇒ 5 %
Total ≈ 38 %.

5. Checklist verification
1. Paraphrase: “By official results of the 12 Apr 2026 election, will any Hungarian party/coalition hold ≥133 of 199 seats?”  
2. Base rate: 72 %.  
3. Line: “38 of 100 times, someone gets 133+ seats.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Winner-comp system (strong). b) Three straight Fidesz 2/3 wins (strong). c) Feb 2026 independent polls Tisza +8-12 (moderate). d) Gov-linked polls Fidesz 49-51 % (moderate). e) Polymarket 57 % Magyar PM (moderate).  
5. Blind spot: final-week surge in rural turnout + split in anti-Fidesz vote pushes Fidesz above 45 % and over seat threshold; would make 38 % too low.  
6. Status-quo drift: Current best aggregate implies no supermajority; nudges probability slightly further toward “No”, hence sub-50 estimate.

Probability calibration
My 38 % combines a still-significant structural bias toward supermajorities with the most credible polling to date showing Fidesz below the vote share normally needed, plus prediction-market scepticism.

Probability: 38%
