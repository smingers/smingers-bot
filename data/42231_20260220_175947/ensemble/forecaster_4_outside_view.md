Analysis:

A. Source analysis  
1. Scheppele, “Hungary—An Election in Question” (NY Times blog, Feb 2014).  
   • Scholarly, written before the 2014 vote; explains details of the 2011 reform and its mechanical bias toward the largest party.  
   • Mostly factual description of the electoral formula; authorial opinion (that the system is unfair) is noted but not decisive for the forecast.  
   • High quality for technical background, no current polling.  

2. Institute of Geoeconomics policy brief (Oct 2025).  
   • Detailed catalogue of every rule change since 2011 and discussion of hypothetical reforms still legally possible before Apr 2026.  
   • Factual in its recounting of statutes; speculative where it lists “potential” future amendments—those passages are treated cautiously.  

3. Freedom House – Freedom in the World: Hungary 2022.  
   • NGO report with well-sourced factual summaries of the 2018 results and structural advantages enjoyed by Fidesz.  
   • Good for establishing the recurrence of two-thirds outcomes; less useful for current race conditions.  

4. IFES Election Guide (2022).  
   • Purely descriptive; confirms seat counts and ⅔ threshold. Very reliable for historical tallies.  

5. The Nation, “Is This Viktor Orbán’s Last Stand?” (17 Feb 2026).  
   • Magazine article; mixes reportage with opinion. Factual nuggets: inflation numbers, Tisza’s polling lead in several independent surveys, expert rules-of-thumb (“Tisza needs ≥ 4 pp popular-vote lead just to win a simple majority”).  
   • Use data, discount polemics.  

6. Deutsche Welle news report (mid-Feb 2026).  
   • Reputable international broadcaster. States that “most independent polls show Tisza ahead,” without figures. Treated as secondary confirmation of a possible opposition lead.  

7. Hungarian Conservative / Center for Fundamental Rights poll (17 Feb 2026).  
   • Source is partisan-leaning in favour of Fidesz; nevertheless publishes explicit numbers (Fidesz 49 %, Tisza 42 %).  
   • We keep the poll in the dataset while attaching lower weight because of house effects.  

8. Agent-compiled polling/seat-projection memo (20 Feb 2026).  
   • Synthesis of multiple public polls; dates and institutes are checkable; distinguishes independent vs. government-linked pollsters; contains empirical heuristics drawn from past elections.  
   • Useful as a consolidated factual digest.  

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. All Hungarian elections since democratisation (1990–2022): 9 elections, 4 supermajorities (2010, 2014, 2018, 2022) → 44 %.  
   – Weakness: mixes two radically different electoral systems; earlier elections do not reflect current institutional tilt.  

2. Elections conducted under the *current* 199-seat, winner-compensation rules (2014, 2018, 2022): 3/3 supermajorities → 100 %.  
   – Strength: small but perfectly matched to the mechanism in force.  

3. Elections in electoral autocracies that have redesigned systems to favour incumbents (e.g., Russia 2007-2021 Duma, Turkey 2011-2018 parliament, Serbia 2014-2022 assembly).  
   – Yields 70-80 % frequency of constitutional or near-constitutional majorities for incumbents.  
   – Broader sample, but institutional specifics differ.  

Given closeness of match, Reference Class 2 is chosen, tempered by the broader authoritarian-incumbent class to avoid extreme overconfidence from an n = 3 record.

C. Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 20 Feb 2026. Election day: 12 Apr 2026 ⇒ 52 days (7½ weeks).  
• In the three prior cycles, final seat outcome was highly correlated with polling averages 2 months out *provided* the governing party was already above ~45 % vote share.  
• Large late swings (≥ 6 pp) have *not* occurred in Hungary since 2006; the median late-campaign shift since 2010 is ~2 pp.  

D. Justification for an *outside* view  
1. Structural bias: winner-compensation, FPTP districts (53 % of seats) and gerrymander jointly give the plurality party a steep seat bonus.  
2. Historical regularity: since the reform came into force every election has translated a vote share of 44-54 % into ≥ 133 seats for Fidesz-KDNP.  
3. Symmetry: the same bias would *not* automatically work for an opposition bloc, because (a) opposition geography is concentrated in urban areas with larger populations per seat and (b) small radical-right party Mi Hazánk is highly likely to cross the 5 % threshold, denying the opposition a clean two-party contest in many districts.  
4. Potential game-changing events (law amendments abolishing winner-compensation, legal harassment of Tisza, or a landslide opposition vote) are possible but historically rare in the 50-day window before Hungarian elections.  
5. Reference-class base rate = 100 % (n = 3). To avoid anchoring on a tiny sample we blend in the broader authoritarian-incumbent class rate (≈ 75 %) with equal weights, yielding an initial 87.5 %.  
6. Discount factors:  
   – First election in 16 yrs where credible polls show the government trailing in some surveys (–12 pts).  
   – Non-trivial possibility of pre-election rule change that would *reduce* the chance of any party reaching 133 (–5 pts).  
   – Chance that an opposition landslide actually clears the 133-seat bar despite structural headwinds (~3 %). This *adds* 3 pts because the forecast is about “any party,” not only Fidesz.  

Computation: 87.5 % – 12 % – 5 % + 3 % ≈ 73.5 %.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 3/3 supermajorities under the current system → 100 %.  
Shrink toward a more general authoritarian-incumbent success rate (≈ 75 %).  
Apply explicit deductions for unprecedented polling environment and for a conceivable but still unlikely legal change.  
Add a small upward adjustment for the remote, but non-zero, scenario that the *opposition* achieves a two-thirds.  
Control for overconfidence by nudging the figure a couple of points toward 50 % (Good Judgment practice of extremising only with strong evidence does not apply here because the base is already extreme).  

Resulting probability = 72 – 75 % range; pick the midpoint of the calibrated interval.

Outside View Prediction:
