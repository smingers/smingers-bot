Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, all dates 2026 unless noted)

1. Euronews, 19 Feb ‒ Poll–split article  
   • Factual: publishes six January–February polls, lists house effects, quotes named political scientists.  
   • Quality: large European broadcaster, generally reliable; polling figures traceable to institutes. Strong for vote-share data.

2. Polit Pro poll aggregate (online dashboard, 18 Feb)  
   • Factual: weighted average gives TISZA 45.2 %, Fidesz-KDNP 41.7 %, seat model 99-89-11.  
   • Quality: methodology transparent, but still a model; moderate reliability.

3. Polymarket odds (continuously updated, 20 Feb snapshot)  
   • Factual: market prices (Magyar 56 %, Orbán 42 %).  
   • Quality: incentive-compatible but thinly regulated; good as sentiment indicator, not hard data.

4. DW, 10 Dec 2025 ‒ presidential-removal amendment  
   • Factual: parliament vote 134/199 confirms Fidesz still commands two-thirds today.  
   • Quality: German public broadcaster, high.

5. SafeAbroad brief, 13 Aug 2025 ‒ protest & LGBTQ+ ban  
   • Mostly context; weak direct relevance to seat arithmetic; quality moderate.

6. AskNews/La Razón, Диалог.UA, etc. (19-20 Feb) ‒ campaign mud-slinging, war narrative  
   • Provide colour, not numbers. Use only as weak qualitative evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence
• Five independent pollsters (Medián, Závecz, IDEA, 21 RC, Népszava) all show TISZA leading Fidesz by 5-15 pp since January.  
• Polit Pro seat model converts these shares to c. 99 seats, i.e. well below 133.  
• Historic last-8-weeks polling volatility in Hungary ≤ 2 pp (2014-2022); late surges rare.

Moderate evidence  
• Government-linked pollsters (Nézőpont, Fundamental Rights, HSRI) show Fidesz ahead by 5-10 pp. Methodological bias suspected but cannot be ignored.  
• Prediction market prices give ≈60 % chance of Magyar premiership – implies market view that Fidesz supermajority is unlikely but not impossible.  
• Structural “winner-compensation” rule means ≈45-50 % of national vote can translate into ⅔ of seats for the largest party. This keeps a non-trivial supermajority tail.

Weak evidence  
• Possible late electoral-law tweaks, AI-video scandal, protests. Direction and magnitude uncertain.  
• Coalition mathematics (e.g., Fidesz + Mi Hazánk) would still need ≥122 seats for the lead party, so adds little unless one party is already near ⅔.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days to election: 52.  If halved to 26 days, I would trim a further 2 pp from supermajority probability (campaign time shrinks).  If doubled to 104 days, I would add 3 pp to reflect extra time for an Orbán comeback or rule changes.

(d) Justification – outside→inside adjustment

Outside view base rate (post-2011 elections) = 78 % (previous step).

Downward adjustments:

1. Unified challenger: unlike 2014-22, opposition votes concentrate in one party; reduces Fidesz district sweep odds.  → −25 pp.

2. Polling picture: best independent estimate puts Fidesz 7 pp behind; at that deficit supermajority probability for *any* party is low.  → −20 pp.

3. Yet structural bias remains and TISZA itself is polling near the 45-50 % supermajority threshold; furthermore, house-effect uncertainty is large (∼8 pp spread).  → +5 pp.

4. Possibility of post-election coalition achieving 133 seats is tiny (<2 pp) but not zero.  → +2 pp.

Numerical update: 78 % −25 % −20 % +5 % +2 % = 40 %.  
Apply further Bayesian dampening for model risk (×0.45) → 18 %.

Interpretation: Roughly one election in six under current conditions delivers a two-thirds bloc; five in six do not.

Probability calibration

My inside-view probability that any party or coalition will hold at least 133 of 199 seats after the 12 April 2026 vote is 18 %.

Checklist:
1. Question restated: “By the April 2026 election outcome, will someone have ≥133/199 seats?”  
2. Outside base = 78 %.  
3. Consistency: “18 out of 100 times, a supermajority happens.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Independent polls show TISZA ahead 5-15 pp.  
   • Seat model gives largest party 99 seats.  
   • Historic late swings ≤2 pp.  
   • Winner-compensation means 45-50 % vote can still flip to ⅔ seats.  
5. Blind-spot: Massive, coordinated last-month smear or rule change swings 5-6 pp to Fidesz, letting it sweep districts. Would raise odds to >50 %.  
6. Status-quo drift (continued TISZA lead) favours “No” outcome; nudged forecast slightly downward from neutral.

Probability: 18%
