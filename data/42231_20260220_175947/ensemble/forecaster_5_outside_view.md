Analysis:

A. Source analysis  

1. Kim Lane Scheppele blog post (NYT / 2014).  
   • Factual core: describes the 2011 reform (“winner-compensation”, redistricting).  
   • Quality: written by a Princeton constitutional-law scholar; strongly opinionated but technically accurate and still the standard description of the system.  

2. Institute of Geoeconomics report (Oct 2025).  
   • Factual: restates electoral rules, details additional tweaks (2020 party-registration rule, 2024 redistricting). Flags three hypothetical pre-2026 reforms.  
   • Quality: think-tank white paper, foot-notes Hungarian statutes; balanced, dated four months ago, so still timely.  

3. Freedom House “Freedom in the World 2022”.  
   • Factual: gives 2018 seat/vote figures, lists OSCE criticisms.  
   • Quality: widely-used NGO dataset; moderate partisanship but data elements (turn-out, seat counts) are archival facts.  

4. IFES Election Guide 2022.  
   • Purely factual electoral-mechanics digest. High reliability.  

5. The Nation article (17 Feb 2026).  
   • Factual elements: inflation figures, scandals, expert quotes on vote-margin thresholds.  
   • Quality: magazine with left-leaning editorial line; quotes identifiable Hungarian scholars (Bíró-Nagy, Fleck). Opinions separated from reported facts.  

6. DW News dispatch (Feb 2026).  
   • Factual: cites Tisza ≈30 % in 2024 EU election; “most polls show a lead”.  
   • Quality: mainstream European public broadcaster; short, not data-dense.  

7. Hungarian Conservative / Center for Fundamental Rights poll (17 Feb 2026).  
   • Factual: publishes a 49 % : 42 % Fidesz lead.  
   • Quality: polling institute with documented pro-government lean; methodology publicly released, but partisan bias probable. Still useful as one pole of the current polling range.  

8. Agent report (LM synthesis of several outlets, 20 Feb 2026).  
   • Aggregates historic seat counts, lists February polling spread, states common seat-conversion heuristics. Cites named experts and dates.  
   • Quality: secondary compilation; internally consistent and matches primary sources, acceptable with caution.

B. Reference-class analysis  

Candidate classes considered:  
1. All Hungarian parliamentary elections since 1990 (8 contests). Supermajority occurred in 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022 → 4/8 = 50 %. Drawback: mixes two different electoral systems.  
2. Elections held under the post-2011 Fundamental Law (2014, 2018, 2022) → 3/3 = 100 %. Small-n but institutionally identical to 2026; captures structural tilt.  
3. Other European mixed-member systems (Germany, Scotland, Wales) → supermajorities essentially 0 %. Poor match because they are compensatory rather than winner-compensatory.  

Chosen reference class: Hungary 2014–2022 elections (Class 2). It is the only class that shares seat count (199), district map, surplus-vote formula, and current gerrymander.

C. Time-frame analysis  

Time until outcome: 52 days.  
Historic volatility in last-eight-weeks Hungarian polling:  
• 2014: Fidesz list share moved <2 pp.  
• 2018: ≤1 pp.  
• 2022: ≤2 pp despite COVID and war headlines.  

Thus large late swings are unusual; the structural tilt tends to hard-bake outcomes.  

D. Justification for outside-view probability  

Baseline from reference class = 100 % (3/3).  However, adjust for:  

– Small-sample inflation: shrink toward the long-term 50 % Hungarian base rate (pre-2011 + post-2011) to reflect uncertainty. Bayesian pseudo-count: treat the 3 observed “Yes” events as 3 successes out of 4 pseudo-trials (Jeffreys prior 0.5,0.5) → (3 + 0.5)/(3 + 0.5 + 0.5) ≈ 0.83.  

– Structural continuity: No reform yet adopted to neutralise winner-compensation; therefore upward adjustment back toward the empirical 1.0, say +5 pp → 0.88.  

– Possibility of election cancellation/major reform before April (mentioned but historically unprecedented): assign 2 % weight to “no election or radical rule change that blocks any supermajority” → multiply by 0.98 → 0.86.  

– Upset frequency in competitive hybrid regimes: in comparable semi-authoritarian systems (e.g., Serbia 2000, Turkey 2019 locals) opposition breakthroughs happen ~1 in 10 national-level contests. Apply a further −8 pp to reflect that tail risk → 0.78.  

Round to a single-percentage point for clarity.

Outside view calibration:
Starting with the perfect 3/3 supermajority record under the current rules, we shrink toward a broader Hungarian electoral history, then adjust for (i) unchanged structural bias, (ii) small chance of procedural discontinuity, (iii) fat-tailed upset risk typical of competitive autocracies. The resulting calibrated outside-view probability that some party (overwhelmingly, Fidesz-KDNP) again clears 133 seats on 12 April 2026 is 78 %.

Outside View Prediction: 78 %.
