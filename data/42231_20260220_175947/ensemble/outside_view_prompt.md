You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will any political party or coalition acquire a supermajority in the 2026 Hungarian parliamentary elections?

Question background:
In 2010, Viktor Orbán’s party, Fidesz–Hungarian Civic Alliance, together with [its ally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidesz%E2%80%93KDNP) the Christian Democratic People’s Party (KDNP), [won 52.7% of the vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Hungarian_parliamentary_election) but—because of the electoral system—secured 263 of 386 seats, a ⅔ supermajority, giving the party the ability to amend the constitution without the support of other parties.

And indeed the government then amended the constitution, enacting [the Fundamental Law of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Hungary#2011_Constitution), under which: (i) Parliament shrank from 386 to 199 seats; (ii) Single-round voting replaced the old two-round system; (iii) a “Winner compensation” system was introduced; and (iv) Redistricting occurred. With these changes, a party with \~45–50% of the popular vote can acquire a two-thirds constitutional supermajority. Under the old rules, such a feat was much less likely.

Hungary's [electoral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Hungary#National_Assembly_elections) is neither purely majoritarian (e.g., winner-take-all, district-based elections), nor purely proportional (e.g., a party-list election where districts don't matter). Instead, it is a mixed system that favours the majoritarian approach. Of the 199 seats, 106 are District Seats (elected via first-past-the-post voting) and 93 are List Seats (elected based on total national proportion). But Hungary's system [differs from other Mixed Systems such as Germany's](https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/hungary-an-election-in-question-part-3/) due to the "winner compensation" system under which the surplus votes for the winner in a district are added into the national votes, allowing the party that won the district to win extra List Seats as well. With the current electoral system in Germany the list tier is used to *correct* toward proportionality. In Hungary, the surplus mechanism can *magnify* the dominance of the district winner.

The [next Hungarian parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Hungarian_parliamentary_election) are scheduled for April 12, 2026.

## Summary: "Hungary, An Election in Question, Part 3" (Kim Lane Scheppele, via Paul Krugman's Blog, February 2014)

### Core Subject: Hungary's "Winner Compensation" Electoral System

Written by Princeton professor Kim Lane Scheppele ahead of Hungary's 2014 elections, this article explains how Fidesz redesigned Hungary's electoral system to systematically magnify majority victories into supermajorities.

---

### How Traditional Proportional Compensation Works
In standard PR systems (e.g., Germany), **losing parties** receive compensatory votes added to their party-list totals when their district candidates underperform relative to their national vote share. This corrects results *toward* proportionality.

---

### Hungary's Novel "Winner Compensation" Departure
Under Fidesz's reformed system, **winning parties also receive compensation votes**. The logic: votes cast beyond the minimum needed to win a district are deemed "surplus" or "lost," and are added to the winner's national party-list totals.

**Example provided:**
- Red party wins a district with 500 votes; Green gets 200; Yellow gets 100.
- Red only needed 201 votes to win, so **299 "surplus" votes** are added to Red's party-list tally.
- Green and Yellow also receive their votes as compensation (as under the old system).

**Effect:** Winners are rewarded *twice* — once with the district seat, and again with boosted list-seat allocations. This pushes results **further from proportionality**, not closer.

---

### Strategic Design and Political Context
- The system was designed when Fidesz was the clear plurality party facing a **fragmented opposition**.
- Against a divided opposition (e.g., four parties each getting 100 votes vs. Fidesz's 500), Fidesz would gain **399 winner compensation votes**.
- If the opposition unified (combining to 400 votes), Fidesz's compensation drops to just **99 votes** — explaining why opposition unity was strategically essential.
- Scheppele notes that gerrymandered districts make it nearly impossible for a unified opposition to win districts by large enough margins to benefit from the same mechanism.

---

### Election Administration Concerns
- The Election Commission was **reorganized twice** after 2010, with opposition members removed.
- Current (2014) Commission members were nominated by a former Fidesz vice-president and elected by the Fidesz-dominated parliament; **no opposition members** hold permanent seats.
- The head of the Election Office is a **former Fidesz government official**.
- During campaigns, parties running national lists can add delegates to the Commission, potentially diluting Fidesz allies' dominance — but the Election Office itself gains no opposition representation.
- Scheppele flags "worrying signs" of **inaccurate and misleading information** from election officials, to be detailed in a subsequent post.

---

### Key Takeaway
Scheppele's central argument is that Hungary's winner compensation system is **unique among European PR systems** and was deliberately engineered to convert plurality vote shares into constitutional supermajorities, particularly in a fragmented political landscape. The opposition needed to both unify *and* outperform Fidesz by 6–8 percentage points just to achieve a simple parliamentary majority.

## Summary: Hungary's Electoral System and 2026 Election Prospects

*(Institute of Geoeconomics/Asia Pacific Initiative, October 20, 2025)*

### Structure of Hungary's Electoral System

Hungary's unicameral parliament has 199 seats (reduced from 386 in 2014): 106 elected in single-member constituencies (first-past-the-post) and 93 via proportional representation. The 2011 electoral reform (Act CCIII of 2011), passed under Orbán's parliamentary majority, officially aimed at proportionality and simplification, but critics argue it systematically advantaged the governing party through four key mechanisms:

1. **Increased weight of single-member constituencies** (from ~46% to 53% of seats), strengthening winner-take-all dynamics.
2. **Gerrymandering**: Princeton scholar Kim Lane Scheppele argues opposition-leaning areas were packed into larger constituencies while Fidesz-leaning areas were split. A late 2024 redistricting (shifting 2 seats from Budapest to surrounding Pest County) drew similar criticism from analyst Róbert László of Political Capital and outlet Telex.
3. **Abolition of the two-round system**: A simple plurality now suffices to win a constituency, enabling Fidesz to win seats even in weaker areas like Budapest. In 2014, all Fidesz Budapest winners received under 50% of the vote.
4. **"Winner compensation" mechanism**: Surplus votes beyond what a candidate needed to win are transferred to the party's proportional list, further magnifying the dominance of the leading party—a system scholars like Anna von Notz (Verfassungsblog) argue accentuates winner-take-all outcomes.

### Additional Electoral Law Changes Since 2011

- **2012**: Ethnic Hungarians abroad (without Hungarian residence) gained postal voting rights in the proportional tier, while citizens temporarily abroad must vote at embassies—a distinction criticized as discriminatory.
- **2020**: Party registration requirements were tightened; parties must now field candidates in 71 of 106 constituencies (up from 27), including Budapest and 14 of 19 counties, making it significantly harder for opposition parties to compete nationally.

### Potential Pre-2026 Reforms

Election analyst Róbert László has warned since 2024 that further systemic changes before the 2026 election remain possible. Three scenarios are discussed:

1. **Abolishing "winner compensation"** if a Tisza Party victory appears likely, to limit the scale of Fidesz's defeat.
2. **Lowering the 5% electoral threshold** to fragment opposition votes away from the Tisza Party.
3. **Abolishing single-member districts entirely** in favor of pure proportional representation—which would make achieving a two-thirds supermajority by any party virtually impossible.

### Broader Concerns

Beyond institutional changes, the article flags more extreme scenarios raised by observers (including Anton Shekhovtsov, Visiting Professor at Central European University): potential criminal charges against Tisza Party leader Magyar to bar his candidacy, or outright nullification of election results (citing Romania's presidential election as a precedent). The article concludes that both potential institutional reforms and the integrity of the electoral process itself warrant close monitoring ahead of April 2026.

### Electoral System & Recent Results

- Hungary's 199-seat National Assembly uses a mixed system: 106 seats from single-member districts (first-past-the-post) and 93 from compensatory party lists.
- In the **April 2018 parliamentary elections**, the Fidesz–KDNP coalition won **49.3% of the vote** and captured **exactly two-thirds (133 seats)** — the minimum threshold for a supermajority.
- Other results: Jobbik (far-right) won 26 seats; MSZP-led coalition won 20 seats.

### Election Integrity Concerns (OSCE 2018 Assessment)
- Elections were "generally well administered" but marred by:
  - **Overlap between state and ruling party resources**
  - Opaque campaign finance
  - Media bias favoring Fidesz
  - "Intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric"
  - No evidence of outright fraud affecting outcomes, but irregularities were noted
  - Citizens were not permitted to participate in election observation at polling places

### Structural Advantages for Fidesz
- **Electoral rules** were amended to require parties to field candidates in **71 (up from 27) single-member constituencies**, forcing small opposition parties to consolidate.
- The **State Audit Office (ÁSZ)** has imposed financial sanctions almost exclusively on opposition parties while overlooking Fidesz irregularities.
- The **public broadcaster** showed "clear patterns of political bias" in election-related programming.
- Opposition parties faced **bogus competitors** in 2014 and 2018, potentially created to split the opposition vote.
- Fidesz dominates the **advertising market**, including billboards.

### Opposition Dynamics
- The opposition remains **fragmented**, though in **2021**, opposition parties organized joint primaries to select unified candidates for the 2022 general elections.
- Fidesz **lost several cities**, including Budapest, in the **2019 local elections**.

### Governance
- Fidesz maintains a **parliamentary supermajority**, enabling it to draft and implement laws without meaningful opposition interference.
- Prime Minister Orbán has been in power since 2010, winning reelections in 2014 and 2018.
- A **referendum on an anti-LGBT+ "child protection" law** was announced alongside the 2022 elections.

## Summary: IFES Election Guide – Hungarian National Assembly 2022 General Election

This article provides factual background on the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary elections.

### Electoral Structure
- **199 total seats** in the unicameral National Assembly
- **106 seats** filled via single-member constituencies (first-past-the-post)
- **93 seats** filled via proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency
- **Thresholds**: 5% for single parties; 10% for two-party joint lists; 15% for three-or-more party joint lists
- Surplus votes distributed using the **d'Hondt method**

### Key Parties and Prior Seat Counts (from 2018 election)
- **Fidesz-KDNP** (led by Viktor Orbán): Won **133 seats** in 2018 — exactly the ⅔ supermajority threshold
  - Fidesz alone: 116 seats; KDNP: 17 seats
- **United for Hungary** (six-party opposition coalition, led by Péter Márki-Zay): New coalition for 2022
- **Our Homeland Movement**: Did not exist in 2018; held 2 seats at time of writing

### Key Contextual Note
The 2018 result for Fidesz-KDNP (133 seats) is directly relevant to the forecasting question, as **133 seats represents the exact ⅔ supermajority threshold** in the 199-seat parliament.

## Summary: "Is This Viktor Orbán's Last Stand?" (*The Nation*, February 17, 2026)

### Core Political Situation
The article describes a surprising reversal of political fortunes ahead of Hungary's April 12, 2026 parliamentary elections. Despite Fidesz having secured two-thirds supermajorities in **every election since 2010**, the party is currently **trailing the opposition Tisza (Respect and Freedom Party) by double digits** in polling.

### The Opposition: Tisza and Peter Magyar
- Tisza was founded by **Peter Magyar**, a 44-year-old former Fidesz insider.
- Crucially, the **broader opposition has united behind Magyar** for the first time — socialists, greens, liberals, conservatives, Roma activists, and social democrats have coalesced to oust Fidesz.
- Analysts note Magyar is himself a conservative from within Fidesz, raising questions about how aggressively he would dismantle Fidesz structures if elected.

### Why Fidesz Is Struggling
- **Economic deterioration**: Inflation surged to over 17% in 2023; food prices jumped 82% between 2019–2025; cumulative inflation reached 50%.
- **Scandals**: Hungarian President Katalin Novák resigned after pardoning an accomplice of a convicted child abuser; a separate pedophilia scandal involving state-run juvenile facilities prompted mass protests.
- **Lost EU funding**: Hungary has had an estimated **€20+ billion in EU funds withheld** due to rule-of-law concerns.

### Structural Advantages Still Favoring Fidesz
- **Electoral system**: Rural votes in Orbán strongholds in eastern Hungary are more heavily weighted than urban votes.
- **Spending disparity**: Analyst András Bíró-Nagy estimates Fidesz can outspend Tisza **"more than 100 to one."**
- **Media control**: Independent media has been nationalized or bought by Orbán allies; critical civil society has been marginalized.
- **Emergency powers**: With Hungary in a declared state of emergency due to the Ukraine war, Orbán has broad powers to rule by decree.
- **Gerrymandering and institutional entrenchment**: Orbán rewrote the constitution, packed courts, and redistricted to Fidesz's advantage.

### Expert Assessments on What Tisza Needs to Win
- **András Bíró-Nagy** (Policy Solutions think tank): Tisza needs a popular vote margin of **at least 4 percentage points** to overcome structural disadvantages; a **10-point victory** would force Fidesz out of power.
- **Zoltan Fleck** (Eötvös Loránd University): Authoritarian regimes rarely exit via elections; Fidesz has strong incentives to resist, including potential legal exposure for its figures. However, he acknowledges "there's a chance Fidesz will exit from power peacefully."
- **Andras Bozoki and Zoltan Fleck** describe Hungary as an **"embedded autocracy"** — a system with democratic trappings but fixed to yield the same electoral result.

### International Support for Orbán
- **Vladimir Putin**, **Donald Trump** (who publicly endorsed Orbán in early February 2026), and **China's Xi Jinping** all back Orbán.
- Russia's disinformation infrastructure aligns with Fidesz's domestic messaging.
- Secretary of State Marco Rubio was scheduled to visit Hungary following the Munich Security Conference.

### Key Framing
The article presents the 2026 election as genuinely competitive but structurally tilted toward Fidesz, with the outcome hinging on the **margin of Tisza's popular vote lead** and whether Hungary's embedded institutional advantages can be overcome by voter discontent.

## Summary: New Poll by The Center Shows Orbán Leading Ahead of April Election

**Source:** Hungarian Conservative | **Date:** February 17, 2026 | **Author:** Joakim Scheffer
*(Note: The Center for Fundamental Rights is described as a Budapest-based conservative think tank, which may introduce some partisan bias in its polling and analysis)*

### Key Poll Findings (Center for Fundamental Rights, February 2026)
- Among committed party voters: **Fidesz–KDNP: 49%** vs. **Tisza Party: 42%** — a **7-point lead**
- The governing alliance's lead has ranged between **5–9 percentage points** since October 2025, with a general widening trend from an initial 5-point margin to the current 7-point margin.

### Polling Methodology & Track Record
- The Center for Fundamental Rights has published **monthly party-preference estimates since October 2025**
- The institute ranked **third most accurate** in the 2024 European elections, missing final results by only **1.6 percentage points**
- By contrast, opposition-leaning pollster **Publicus** missed the 2022 parliamentary election results by **20 percentage points**, consistently underpolling Fidesz

### Other Notable Developments
- Fidesz–KDNP presented their **national list on February 16**, led by Viktor Orbán
- **US Secretary of State Marco Rubio** met with Orbán on the same day, stating Orbán's leadership is **"essential"** for American interests in Central Europe and that President Trump is **"committed"** to Orbán's success in the April election

### Analytical Context (from the think tank's own report)
- Fidesz's resilience attributed to perceptions of stable governance and positions opposing Ukraine war financing and EU accession for Kyiv
- Tisza Party's deficit attributed to reliance on former opposition alliance voters and alignment with "external political and economic centres of influence"

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide historical seat counts for Fidesz-KDNP in 2014, 2018, 2022 Hungarian elections and latest national polls Feb 2026 including party vote shares and seat projection estimates; assess likelihood of any coalition reaching 133 seats
1.  Historical record of Fidesz-KDNP super-majorities  
   • 2014 election (first held under the new 199-seat system) – Fidesz–KDNP won 133 seats, exactly the two-thirds constitutional threshold, on roughly 44.5 % of the party-list vote (LSE European Politics blog, 7 Apr 2014).  
   • 2018 election – 134 seats on 49 % of the list vote (OSW Centre for Eastern Studies, 11 Apr 2018).  
   • 2022 election – 135 seats on 53.5 % of the list vote (Xinhua/China Daily, 4 Apr 2022; About Hungary live blog, 3 Apr 2022).  

   These three contests confirm a structural regularity of the 2011 Fundamental Law: once a party approaches or passes c. 45 % of the national vote and sweeps most single-member constituencies, the “winner-compensation” formula delivers a 133-plus seat haul.

2.  Landscape heading into the April 12 2026 election  
   a.  Parties certain to enter parliament (all polls):  
      – Fidesz-KDNP (incumbent right-wing alliance)  
      – TISZA – the new, centrist–liberal party of Péter Magyar  
      – Mi Hazánk (Our Homeland Movement, radical right) hovers just above the 5 % threshold  
      Smaller left-green formations that contested 2022 separately have largely collapsed or been absorbed into TISZA lists.  

   b.  February 2026 national polling snapshot  
      Independent / opposition-leaning institutes (fieldwork Jan–early Feb):  
      – Medián: TISZA 40 %, Fidesz 33 % among all voters (euronews, 19 Feb 2026).  
      – Závecz: 49 % TISZA vs 39 % Fidesz among certain voters (euronews, 19 Feb 2026).  
      – IDEA: 10-point TISZA lead among decided voters (euronews, 19 Feb 2026).  
      – 21 Research Centre: TISZA +7 pts among all, +16 pts among certain voters (euronews, 19 Feb 2026).

      Government-linked institutes, same period:  
      – Center for Fundamental Rights (Századvég orbit): 49 % Fidesz vs 42 % TISZA among committed voters (Hungarian Conservative, 17 Feb 2026).  
      – Hungarian Social Research Institute: 51 % Fidesz vs 41 % TISZA (euronews, 19 Feb 2026).  
      – Nézőpont allocates undecided but Fidesz-leaning respondents to the governing camp, yielding a 40 % Fidesz : 35 % TISZA split in the full sample (euronews, 19 Feb 2026).

      All polls agree that Mi Hazánk is at 6-7 %, safely in. Turnout expectations are high (2022 turnout was 70 %). The electorate is polarised; late deciders (5-8 %) and mobilisation will be decisive.

   c.  Seat-projection indications  
      None of the cited polls publish full constituency-level seat models, but the OSW monitor (5 Feb 2026) and most Hungarian analysts derive three rules of thumb from the 2014–2022 precedents:  
      • With 49–54 % of the vote and a united slate, Fidesz converts 88–95 of the 106 single-member districts and lands 134-135 total seats.  
      • Because district boundaries were drawn by Fidesz, an opposition bloc needs a nationwide margin of at least 5–6 points merely to win a *simple* majority; a two-thirds majority would require a double-digit popular-vote win plus near-total dominance in Budapest and larger towns – a much steeper climb than the governing side faces (Guardian op-ed by Bíró-Nagy, 15 Feb 2026).  
      • Even a one-point Fidesz *defeat* in the national vote could still yield around 100 constituency victories for the ruling alliance and a narrow majority of seats.

      Applying those heuristics to the current poll spread:  
      – In the *pro-Fidesz* polls (Fidesz 49-51 %), the alliance would probably repeat 2018/2022 and obtain 133-135 seats.  
      – In the *TISZA-leading* polls (TISZA 48-50 %, Fidesz 38-40 %), TISZA would win the list vote but would flip perhaps 55-60 districts – enough for ~105-110 seats, well short of 133.  
      – A hung parliament around 100-100 each side is plausible if the vote is a virtual tie.

3.  Prospects for any bloc to reach the 133-seat super-majority in 2026  
   • Fidesz-KDNP: History shows that once the alliance keeps the national vote at/above 45 % and preserves its rural district hegemony, the mathematics almost automatically delivers ≥133 seats. If the governing parties’ real standing is what the Center for Fundamental Rights and HSRI report (≈50 %), a fifth consecutive super-majority is probable. If, however, the independent polls are closer to the mark and Fidesz dips into the low 40s, it would likely *still* finish first in seats but lose the ⅔ threshold – the fate it briefly suffered after mid-term by-elections in 2015.  

   • TISZA (alone or with others): For an opposition super-majority the hurdles are considerably higher. TISZA would need something on the order of 55-57 % of the list vote *plus* near-total district sweep, because Mi Hazánk’s 6-7 % siphons off right-wing votes that might otherwise stay with Fidesz in the list tier yet still permit TISZA to win constituencies. None of the February polls places TISZA remotely near that range; even its most favourable numbers (~49 %) would likely leave it c. 20-25 seats short of 133. A coalition with Mi Hazánk is ideologically implausible, and the fragmentary left-green parties look unlikely to win any district seats of their own. Hence an opposition ⅔ is presently a remote scenario.  

   • Other combinations: Hungary’s mixed-member system makes post-election seat bargaining limited; electoral coalitions must be formed before the vote via joint lists and single candidacies. The only pre-existing, coherent alliance is Fidesz-KDNP. Therefore the practical question is whether *that* coalition keeps 133 seats, not whether ad-hoc post-election blocs can get there.

4.  Overall assessment (February 2026)  
   – The super-majority outcome is asymmetric: it is *much easier* for Fidesz-KDNP to clear the 133-seat bar than for any opposition grouping.  
   – Because February polls are split between a narrow Fidesz lead and a narrow TISZA lead, the modal forecast is that Fidesz-KDNP remains the most likely (better than 50 % probability) to retain two-thirds, but the risk of it falling to an ordinary majority is significant and higher than in any election since 2014.  
   – The probability that *any other* coalition attains 133 seats is, at present, low (well below 10 %), given both the vote shares and structural biases.

5.  Information gaps  
   • No seat-by-seat model for 2026 has yet been published by Hungarian pollsters; when such modelling appears it will refine the estimates above.  
   • February polling lacks fully up-to-date turnout modelling and does not yet incorporate the finalised candidate lists released mid-February by both major parties (OSW, 5 Feb 2026).  

   Apart from those caveats, the available evidence suffices to judge that the only plausible path to a 2026 super-majority runs through a fifth successive Fidesz-KDNP victory; whether they clear it depends on whether their true vote share is closer to 45 % or to 50 %.</Agent_report>
