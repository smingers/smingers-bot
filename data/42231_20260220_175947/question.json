    "description": "In 2010, Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party, Fidesz\u2013Hungarian Civic Alliance, together with [its ally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidesz%E2%80%93KDNP) the Christian Democratic People\u2019s Party (KDNP), [won 52.7% of the vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Hungarian_parliamentary_election) but\u2014because of the electoral system\u2014secured 263 of 386 seats, a \u2154 supermajority, giving the party the ability to amend the constitution without the support of other parties.\n\nAnd indeed the government then amended the constitution, enacting [the Fundamental Law of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Hungary#2011_Constitution), under which: (i) Parliament shrank from 386 to 199 seats; (ii) Single-round voting replaced the old two-round system; (iii) a \u201cWinner compensation\u201d system was introduced; and (iv) Redistricting occurred. With these changes, a party with \\~45\u201350% of the popular vote can acquire a two-thirds constitutional supermajority. Under the old rules, such a feat was much less likely.\n\nHungary's [electoral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Hungary#National_Assembly_elections) is neither purely majoritarian (e.g., winner-take-all, district-based elections), nor purely proportional (e.g., a party-list election where districts don't matter). Instead, it is a mixed system that favours the majoritarian approach. Of the 199 seats, 106 are District Seats (elected via first-past-the-post voting) and 93 are List Seats (elected based on total national proportion). But Hungary's system [differs from other Mixed Systems such as Germany's](https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/hungary-an-election-in-question-part-3/) due to the \"winner compensation\" system under which the surplus votes for the winner in a district are added into the national votes, allowing the party that won the district to win extra List Seats as well. With the current electoral system in Germany the list tier is used to *correct* toward proportionality. In Hungary, the surplus mechanism can *magnify* the dominance of the district winner.\n\nThe [next Hungarian parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Hungarian_parliamentary_election) are scheduled for April 12, 2026.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40005,\"question_id\":39549}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as Yes if any party or coalition acquires a \u2154 supermajority (i.e., at least 133 seats) in the first Hungarian parliamentary elections held after this question opens, according to official election results.",
    "fine_print": "If no parliamentary elections take place in Hungary before January 1, 2027, this question will be annulled.\n\n***\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40005) which opened on 2026-02-16 19:06:49. This question will resolve based on the resolution criteria and fine print contained above. However, if this question would resolve differently than the original question, then this question will be annulled.
