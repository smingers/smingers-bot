Analysis:
To estimate the chance of a ⅔ super-majority in 2026 we first need the historical baseline: how many seats Fidesz-KDNP (and any opposition coalition) actually won in 2014, 2018 and 2022 under the post-2011 electoral rules. Second, we must know the current vote-intention numbers (early-2026 polls) and, ideally, seat-projection modelling that converts those numbers into seats, given Hungary’s “winner-compensation” system. These two blocks of information—historical seat outcomes and up-to-date polling/seat projections—form the key outside view.
