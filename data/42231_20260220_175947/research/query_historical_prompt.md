You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will any political party or coalition acquire a supermajority in the 2026 Hungarian parliamentary elections?

Question background:
In 2010, Viktor Orbán’s party, Fidesz–Hungarian Civic Alliance, together with [its ally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidesz%E2%80%93KDNP) the Christian Democratic People’s Party (KDNP), [won 52.7% of the vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Hungarian_parliamentary_election) but—because of the electoral system—secured 263 of 386 seats, a ⅔ supermajority, giving the party the ability to amend the constitution without the support of other parties.

And indeed the government then amended the constitution, enacting [the Fundamental Law of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Hungary#2011_Constitution), under which: (i) Parliament shrank from 386 to 199 seats; (ii) Single-round voting replaced the old two-round system; (iii) a “Winner compensation” system was introduced; and (iv) Redistricting occurred. With these changes, a party with \~45–50% of the popular vote can acquire a two-thirds constitutional supermajority. Under the old rules, such a feat was much less likely.

Hungary's [electoral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Hungary#National_Assembly_elections) is neither purely majoritarian (e.g., winner-take-all, district-based elections), nor purely proportional (e.g., a party-list election where districts don't matter). Instead, it is a mixed system that favours the majoritarian approach. Of the 199 seats, 106 are District Seats (elected via first-past-the-post voting) and 93 are List Seats (elected based on total national proportion). But Hungary's system [differs from other Mixed Systems such as Germany's](https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/hungary-an-election-in-question-part-3/) due to the "winner compensation" system under which the surplus votes for the winner in a district are added into the national votes, allowing the party that won the district to win extra List Seats as well. With the current electoral system in Germany the list tier is used to *correct* toward proportionality. In Hungary, the surplus mechanism can *magnify* the dominance of the district winner.

The [next Hungarian parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Hungarian_parliamentary_election) are scheduled for April 12, 2026.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as Yes if any party or coalition acquires a ⅔ supermajority (i.e., at least 133 seats) in the first Hungarian parliamentary elections held after this question opens, according to official election results.

Additional fine-print:
If no parliamentary elections take place in Hungary before January 1, 2027, this question will be annulled.

This question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40005) which opened on 2026-02-16 19:06:49. This question will resolve based on the resolution criteria and fine print contained above. However, if this question would resolve differently than the original question, then this question will be annulled. Additionally, if the original question's resolution could have been known before this question opened, then this question will be annulled.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-20. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-20 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:

2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
