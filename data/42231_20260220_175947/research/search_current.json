The article does not specify individual polling institutes used, though it describes a weighted averaging methodology.\n\n---\n\n### Current Poll Trend (as of article publication, ~50 days before April 12, 2026 election)\n\n- **TISZA** leads with **45.2%** of votes (poll trend figure: **46.5%**), gaining +1.9 points over the past 30 days\n- **Fidesz/KDNP**: **41.7%** (down -1.1 points over 30 days)\n- **Mi Haz\u00e1nk**: **5.4%**\n- **Magyar K\u00e9tfark\u00fa Kutya P\u00e1rt**: **3.1%**\n- **Demokratikus Koal\u00edci\u00f3**: **3.0%**\n- **Other parties**: **0.3%**\n\n### Projected Seat Distribution (based on poll trend)\n- **TISZA**: 99 seats\n- **Fidesz/KDNP**: 89 seats\n- **Mi Haz\u00e1nk**: 11 seats\n- The governing Fidesz/KDNP coalition would secure only **44.7% of seats**, falling well short of a parliamentary majority (100 seats needed) and far below the **133-seat supermajority threshold**.\n\n### Key Electoral System Notes\n- Parliament has **199 seats**: 106 via single-member constituencies (FPTP), 93 via national party lists\n- Electoral threshold: **5%** for single parties, **10%** for two-party alliances, **15%** for coalitions of three or more\n- The \"compensatory vote\" system can amplify the strongest party's representation\n\n### Democracy Assessment\n- Hungary scores **34/100** on the Polit Pro Democracy Index, with a \"significant decline\" over the past 10 years\n- Elections are described as \"only partially free and fair, primarily serving to secure the government's power\"\n\n---\n\n**Key takeaway for forecasting:** Based on current polling aggregates, neither Fidesz/KDNP nor TISZA is projected to come close to the 133-seat supermajority threshold. Fidesz/KDNP is projected to lose its existing majority entirely, while TISZA leads but falls well short of supermajority territory.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.hungarianconservative.com/articles/politics/hungary-parliamentary-election-2026-orban-trump-globalist-sovereignist-migration-eu/\">\n## Summary: \"Hungary's Upcoming Election Is No Longer Just about Hungary\" (Hungarian Conservative, November 11, 2025)\n\n**Source note:** This article is published by *Hungarian Conservative*, which has a clear pro-Fidesz/pro-Orb\u00e1n editorial stance.

P\u00e9ter Magyar, leader of the opposition, denounced the video on Facebook, stating that Fidesz 'has crossed all limits' and 'trampled the most basic human and moral standards,' demanding its immediate removal and public apologies to all Hungarians. The video, lasting about 30 seconds, claims the execution is 'just a nightmare, but Brussels is preparing to make it real,' framing the election as a choice between 'war and peace.' Fidesz uses the video to portray the opposition party Tisza\u2014currently leading in polls with 50% support versus Fidesz\u2019s 37%\u2014as a threat that would drag Hungary into war in Ukraine and accuse the European Union of bellicosity. The left-wing Democratic Coalition has initiated legal action, denouncing the video as 'alarmist.' Analyst G\u00e1bor Horn of the Republikon Institute criticized Fidesz\u2019s strategy as rooted in 'exclusion, homophobia, and anti-immigration rhetoric' to sustain its political system, warning that 'worse things' may follow in the remainder of the campaign. Despite the backlash, a recent poll shows 25% of Hungarians believe there is a 'real risk' of war if Orb\u00e1n is not in power. The video's release is part of Fidesz\u2019s broader narrative of national security and fear-based campaigning. Gergely Guly\u00e1s, Hungary\u2019s Minister of the Interior, defended the video, asserting it reflects 'the reality of war,' where thousands die daily.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 05:00 PM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/internacional/oposicion-hungara-condena-video-campana-partido-orban-que-simula-ejecucion_202602206998931b1817b41eb657bd5b.html)\n\n**Orb\u00e1n Claims Ukraine Aims to Create Chaos in Hungary Ahead of 2026 Elections**\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n claimed that Ukraine is attempting to create chaos in Hungary and interfere in the country's parliamentary elections by blocking the 'Druzhba' oil pipeline. He asserted that Kyiv is financing the opposition party 'Tisza' and using political blackmail by halting Russian oil shipments, which he said would increase fuel prices and costs for Hungarian citizens. Orb\u00e1n stated that Budapest will not yield and will protect Hungarian families. The blockage of the 'Druzhba' pipeline began on January 27, 2026, after Russian occupiers shelled Ukraine\u2019s civilian infrastructure, damaging the pipeline. Ukraine immediately informed Budapest and Bratislava of the incident, but Hungary and Slovakia blamed Ukraine for the disruption. Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 echoed these claims, alleging Ukraine is politically blackmailing Hungary and Slovakia, despite no technical justification for stopping the oil flow. The 2026 Hungarian parliamentary elections, where Orb\u00e1n\u2019s ruling party 'Fidesz' faces opposition from 'Tisza' led by P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay, are seen as pivotal. As of February 2026, polls indicate 'Tisza' leads 'Fidesz' by several percentage points. The European Union has clarified its position on the 'Druzhba' pipeline and is pressuring Ukraine to assist Hungary in resolving the oil supply issue.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 05:33 AM\nSource:[\u0414\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433.UA](https://www.dialog.ua/world/329066_1771564086)\n\n**Candidate Free of Burdens\u2014But Which Ones?**\nWith parliamentary elections approaching in about 18 months, current polls suggest that three right-wing parties\u2014PiS, Konfederacja, and Korona\u2014could form a government, but only if they unite in a coalition and the current ruling coalition runs separately, as in 2023. The second condition\u2014separate candidacies\u2014would likely secure the incumbent coalition 40\u201345% of the vote, possibly winning the election, but not necessarily a parliamentary majority. The more critical and complex condition is coalition formation. PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski has repeatedly and firmly ruled out any alliance with Korona, eliminating the possibility of a right-wing tripartite coalition. Even if PiS were to shift alliances, such a move would not secure a majority. Kaczy\u0144ski recently stated on Radio Maryja that he has already chosen a new prime minister, who 'has no burdens regarding the right-wing, patriotic electorate.' The term 'burdens' likely refers to past decisions by former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki that alienated this voter base. This could imply an indirect acknowledgment that Morawiecki\u2019s government made missteps, particularly on issues like EU relations, green transition, coal phase-out, KPO, rule-of-law funds, pandemic policies, and foreign relations with Ukraine, Israel, and the U.S. However, if Kaczy\u0144ski believes Morawiecki\u2019s actions were correct but misunderstood, then the new prime minister may continue the same policies. The article questions whether removing Morawiecki as a candidate would truly resolve the 'burdens' if the underlying policies remain unchanged. Rafa\u0142 Ziemkiewicz has urged the right-wing trio to unify under presidential leadership or at least commit to a post-election coalition, emphasizing that 'burdens'\u2014such as policy disagreements\u2014must be addressed in negotiations. The article concludes that while time is short and the political clock is ticking, dialogue remains essential.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 03:39 PM\nSource:[wpolityce.pl](https://wpolityce.pl/polityka/753592-kandydat-wolny-od-obciazen-ale-jakich)\n\n**Orb\u00e1n's Party Releases Shocking AI Video Exploiting Ukraine War Ahead of April Elections**\nThe ruling Hungarian party, Fidesz, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, published a provocative 33-second AI-generated video during the lead-up to the April 2026 parliamentary elections. The video, shared on the Fidesz Budapest Facebook page, depicts a young girl and her mother mourning their husband and father who allegedly went to fight in Ukraine. It then shows the death of a Hungarian soldier on the battlefield. The accompanying caption warns: 'While this is still a nightmare, Brussels is preparing to turn it into reality... Let's not take risks. Fidesz is the safe choice!' The video exploits the war in Ukraine to frame the opposition party, Tisza, as a threat to national security, claiming it would send Hungarians to fight in Ukraine under orders from the European Commission. Tisza's leader condemned the video as 'revolting,' 'deeply disturbing,' and 'unforgivable,' calling it 'soulless manipulation.' According to Reuters, Tisza leads Fidesz by 8\u201312 percentage points in most polls. Among Orb\u00e1n's supporters, 57% believe Tisza wants to send Hungarians to war, while this belief is negligible among Tisza supporters. This follows Orb\u00e1n's previous public statements labeling Ukraine as Hungary's enemy and suggesting he would not object to Russia fully occupying Ukraine. Additionally, Hungary recently halted diesel fuel exports to Ukraine as punishment for Ukraine\u2019s failure to repair the damaged Druzhba oil pipeline after a Russian strike.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 02:48 PM\nSource:[\u0423\u041d\u0406\u0410\u041d](https://www.unian.net/world/vybory-v-vengrii-viktor-orban-zapugivaet-vengrov-otpravkoy-na-front-13291443.html)\n\n**German Court Orders X To Hand Over Data To German-Based NGOs To Identify 'Disinformation Or Foreign Interference'**\nA Berlin appeals court ordered Elon Musk's social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to provide public data related to Hungary's upcoming April 12, 2026 parliamentary elections to two German-based NGOs\u2014Democracy Reporting International (DRI) and the Society for Civil Rights (GFF)\u2014under the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA). The ruling, issued on February 17, 2026, followed X's refusal to comply with a data request made in November 2025. DRI argued the data is critical to identifying potential disinformation or foreign interference in Hungary\u2019s electoral process. The court emphasized that the DSA grants verified researchers legal access to platform data to assess systemic risks. This decision has sparked controversy, with conservative European groups like MCC Brussels criticizing it as a threat to democratic sovereignty. MCC Brussels noted that DRI receives funding from the European Commission and the German Government\u2014entities aligned with opponents of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2014raising concerns about political bias. The organization has launched the Democracy Interference Observatory (DIO) to monitor alleged EU interference in national elections. Despite the court\u2019s order, the European Commission has refused to release documents related to its use of the DSA in the 2024 Romanian presidential election, citing that the DSA supersedes the EU\u2019s Transparency Regulation\u2014a decision upheld by the EU Ombudsman on December 19, 2025. U.S. House Judiciary Committee documents reveal coordinated efforts between EU authorities, tech companies, and external groups to regulate online political speech, suggesting institutionalized content governance is already in practice. The pattern emerging in Central and Eastern Europe\u2014where allegations of foreign interference are used to justify regulatory overreach and electoral annulment\u2014has raised alarms, especially after Romania annulled its 2024 presidential election based on claims of Russian TikTok interference, which later evidence suggested was actually funded by a Romanian political party. Critics warn that this precedent could be weaponized against any EU member state that elects a government not aligned with Brussels' preferences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 01:07 PM\nSource:[InfoWars](https://www.infowars.com/posts/german-court-orders-x-to-hand-over-data-to-german-based-ngos-to-identify-disinformation-or-foreign-interference/)\n\n**Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski Announces Decision on Future Prime Minister Candidate, Aims for Unity Ahead of 2027 Elections**\nJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of the Law and Justice Party (PiS), announced on February 19, 2026, during a radio interview on Radio Maryja, that the decision on the party\u2019s future prime minister candidate has already been made. He stated that the candidate\u2019s name will be publicly revealed by March 2026. Kaczy\u0144ski emphasized the importance of selecting a candidate under 50 years old, aiming to unify the party and prepare for future coalition politics. This move comes ahead of the 2027 parliamentary elections, as PiS seeks to avoid repeating the 2023 outcome\u2014winning three consecutive elections but failing to secure a parliamentary majority or form a stable government. Kaczy\u0144ski also criticized internal factional conflicts within PiS, calling certain public actions 'extremely harmful' and stressing the need for strict discipline, especially during the critical pre-election period. He acknowledged that disagreements are normal but warned that they must not undermine the party\u2019s cohesion or strategic goals.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 12:36 PM\nSource:[FAKT24.pl](https://www.fakt.pl/polityka/kto-bedzie-kandydatem-pis-na-premiera-prezes-podjal-decyzje/gtddw22)\n\n**Hungarian Election Race: Polls Deliver Contradictory Results**\nIn Hungary, parliamentary elections are scheduled for April 12, 2024, and polling data presents conflicting results. Some surveys show the opposition Tisza Party, led by former Fidesz member and MEP Peter Magyar, leading, while others indicate Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz maintains an advantage. According to Median's January survey, the Tisza Party received 40% support, while Fidesz scored 33%, marking the first time since November that the opposition has led. Zavecz Research reported 49% support for Tisza versus 39% for Fidesz, showing a 10-point lead. IDEA Institute found Tisza ahead by 8 points nationally and 10 points among committed voters. The 21 Research Centre measured Tisza leading by 7 points overall, 10 points among those who declared a preference, and 16 points among definitive voters. However, other firms report different outcomes: Nezopont Institute's data shows Fidesz at 46%, Tisza at 40%, Our Homeland Movement at 7%, and Democratic Coalition at 4%. Nezopont noted Fidesz has 200,000\u2013300,000 mobilizable inactive supporters, while Tisza's base is already 'hyperactive'. The Fundamental Rights Centre reported Fidesz leading by 49% to 42% among committed voters, attributing the advantage to the government\u2019s stable performance and its uncompromising stance toward Ukraine during Russia\u2019s full-scale war. The Hungarian Institute of Social Research found Fidesz at 51% and Tisza at 41% among active voters, with only the far-right Our Homeland Movement expected to cross the parliamentary threshold. Political scientist G\u00e1bor T\u00f6r\u00f6k noted that 21 Research and Nezopont measured Tisza at 35%, suggesting the discrepancy lies in Fidesz's reporting, with approximately 900,000 voters counted differently. Nezopont\u2019s Samuel Agoston Mraz attributed differences to methodological variations, including classifying voters who show sympathy for Fidesz but remain undecided as Fidesz supporters. G\u00e1bor Toka argued methodological differences alone cannot explain the variance. Political scientist Csaba T\u00f3th claimed different research centers are effectively studying different 'countries' based on their results. Analysts note that most polling firms are government-linked, conducting research under state or government contracts. In August 2025, Tamas Lanczi, head of the Sovereignty Protection Office, accused five independent polling firms showing Tisza leading of 'misusing public opinion research and carrying out foreign missions'. The blockchain-based international prediction platform Polymarket shows Orb\u00e1n with a 39% chance of winning and Magyar with a 57% chance. In the party race, 63% expect Tisza to win and 37% expect Fidesz. Although access is restricted in some countries, users can access Polymarket via VPN. Betting odds on the platform rapidly shift based on sudden surges and investment volume. Fidesz has won two-thirds majorities in 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022, with 54.13% of the vote in 2022\u2014the highest party share since 1990.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 06:29 AM\nSource:[euronews](https://tr.euronews.com/2026/02/19/macaristanda-secim-yarisi-anketler-celiskili-sonuclar-veriyor)\n\n**Hungary polls split on April election as Fidesz and Tisza trade leads**\nHungary's upcoming parliamentary election on April 12, 2026, has produced sharply divergent polling results.

The Centre for Fundamental Rights reported 49% support for Fidesz among decided voters versus 42% for Tisza, attributing Fidesz\u2019s edge to steady governance and a firm stance against funding Ukraine. The Hungarian Social Research Institute found 51% support for Fidesz among active voters, compared to 41% for Tisza, with only the far-right Our Homeland Movement expected to cross the parliamentary threshold. Political scientists note methodological differences, but also suggest deeper ideological or institutional biases, as most government-linked polling firms operate under state contracts. In August 2025, Tam\u00e1s L\u00e1nczi accused five independent pollsters of 'abusing' public opinion research and conducting 'foreign assignments'. The Polymarket prediction platform, banned in Hungary, Belgium, Poland, Switzerland, and Portugal (with France allowing only 'view only' access), showed Magyar at 57% chance of winning versus Orb\u00e1n\u2019s 39%, with betting markets favoring Tisza 63% to 37%. Fidesz has won two-thirds majorities in 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022, with 54.13% of the vote in 2022\u2014the highest share since 1990.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[Euronews English](https://www.euronews.com/2026/02/19/hungarian-polls-split-on-april-election-outcome-as-fidesz-and-tisza-trade-leads)\n\n**Mud-slinging in Hungarian election campaign**\nThe Hungarian election campaign in February 2026 is marked by intense political mudslinging, with media outlets from across Europe analyzing the contest between Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party and the opposition Tisza Party led by P\u00e9ter Magyar. Orb\u00e1n is accused of unbridled populism, spreading fear, conspiracy theories, and nationalist rhetoric, including blaming Brussels and the 'German troika' for opposition efforts. Pro-government outlets like Magyar Nemzet highlight international interest in a Tisza-led government, citing Western LNG and investment circles backing Magyar and his party. However, several media sources stress that dismantling Orb\u00e1n\u2019s entrenched power structures\u2014especially in the judiciary, media, and state-owned enterprises\u2014requires more than a parliamentary majority; a constitutional majority is needed. Critics, including the Irish Independent and Handelsblatt, argue that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s alignment with Russia and resistance to Western influence undermine Hungary\u2019s pro-Western future. The Tisza Party\u2019s technocratic platform, which includes adopting the euro, reforming state media, and ending energy dependence on Russia, is seen as a credible alternative by outlets like hvg and N\u00e9pszava, though questions remain about its ability to deliver change. Political scientists like Jaros\u0142aw Kuisz caution against premature optimism, noting the historical difficulty of unseating Orb\u00e1n. Meanwhile, Gazeta Wyborcza and Der Standard emphasize that even a Tisza victory may not dismantle Fidesz\u2019s institutional power without sweeping constitutional reforms. The debate underscores deep uncertainty about whether Hungary can transition to a more democratic and European-aligned system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[eurotopics.net](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/352847/mud-slinging-in-hungarian-election-campaign)\n\n**Orb\u00e1n Faces Strong Opposition in New Poll as TISZA Gains Clear Lead Ahead of April 2026 Elections**\nA survey conducted by the Hungarian newspaper 'N\u00e9pszava' reveals that 80% of Hungarians intend to participate in the parliamentary elections scheduled for April 12, 2026. The opposition party TISZA holds a clear lead over the ruling Fidesz party, with 35% support compared to Fidesz's 30% in the general population. Among decided voters, TISZA leads by 9 percentage points (48% to 39%). TISZA supporters are more mobilized, with 87% expressing intent to vote versus 81% of Fidesz supporters. The survey was likely conducted before the emergence of a potential scandal involving a compromising recording of TISZA leader P\u00e9ter Magyar, which has not yet been publicly released. Despite unfavorable polling, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n maintains his campaign strategy, emphasizing continuity in government, low energy prices, maintaining Hungary's veto power in the EU, and raising the average salary to 1 million forints (approximately 11,110 z\u0142) within four years\u2014a target requiring a 44.7% increase, far exceeding the current annual growth of around 9%. Orb\u00e1n also expands social benefits, including a 14th pension, tax exemption for one million mothers, and continued state-backed mortgages at 3% interest. However, he does not propose lowering Hungary's 27% VAT rate\u2014the highest in the EU\u2014on essentials like fuel, electronics, clothing, and services, which heavily burden household budgets. Instead, he focuses on geopolitical issues, advocating for Hungary's neutral stance in the Ukraine war and strict migration policies. TISZA proposes limiting parliamentary and prime ministerial terms to two, a measure supported by 60% of respondents, including 96% of TISZA voters and 63% of undecided voters, while 84% of Fidesz supporters oppose it. Eight out of ten Hungarians also expect political renewal, which TISZA reflects by fielding nearly all new candidates through an open application process, with 30- and 40-year-olds dominating and one-third of candidates being women\u2014compared to Fidesz, where women make up less than 20% of candidates.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 09:36 PM\nSource:[Do Rzeczy](https://dorzeczy.pl/opinie/847970/orban-kontra-magyar-nowy-sondaz-daje-wyrazna-przewage-opozycji.html)\n\n**Hungary\u2019s 2026 Elections: Can Magyar Topple Orb\u00e1n and Reclaim Liberal Democracy?**\nThe 2026 European elections in Hungary, held on April 12, 2026, are a pivotal moment for the European Union, as they center on the challenge to Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s leadership. Orb\u00e1n, 62, has been a consistent obstacle to EU unity, opposing sanctions on Russia, delaying aid to Ukraine, and blocking EU decisions through repeated vetoes. His Fidesz party, which holds 37% in the latest aggregated Politico poll, faces a strong challenge from the Tisza party led by P\u00e9ter Magyar, which leads with 49%. The Tisza party accuses Fidesz of nepotism, corruption, and economic decline due to favoritism toward oligarchs, while Orb\u00e1n portrays Magyar as a Brussels puppet. Fidesz has engaged in divisive public debates, particularly around LGBTQ+ rights, while Tisza avoids controversial topics to pursue a parliamentary majority. The electoral system, restructured in 2011 under Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government, is widely seen as biased in favor of Fidesz, with state-controlled media, unequal campaign financing, and special voting rights for ethnic Hungarians abroad. Despite these disadvantages, analysts believe a Tisza victory is possible if the vote remains free and fair. A supermajority would allow constitutional reforms to restore checks and balances, but institutional resistance and entrenched loyalists limit rapid change. A Tisza government is expected to improve EU relations, though Magyar has not endorsed a 'superstate Europe' and opposes mandatory migration quotas and accelerated Ukrainian accession. Analysts agree that while Orb\u00e1n\u2019s disruptive role would likely end, a radical reversal of Hungary\u2019s political trajectory is unlikely in the short term.\nOriginal language: ro\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 11:28 PM\nSource:[antena3.ro](https://www.antena3.ro/externe/cele-mai-importante-alegeri-din-europa-in-2026-au-loc-in-ungaria-5-intrebari-cheie-773560.html)\n\n**Hungarians to Vote on April 12, 2026, in a Critical Parliamentary Election**\nHungarians are set to vote on April 12, 2026, to elect their new parliament, with Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, in power since 2010, facing a potential defeat. Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party is trailing behind the opposition coalition Tisza, led by Peter Magyar, a former government member who has emerged as a vocal critic of Orb\u00e1n. Independent polls show Tisza leading by a stable double-digit margin\u2014around 50%\u2014while Fidesz hovers near 35%, though analysts like Szabolcs Pek of the Iranytu Institute caution that nearly 90 days remain before the election. Over the past four legislative elections, Fidesz-KDNP had secured a two-thirds supermajority, enabling Orb\u00e1n to pass laws and constitutional changes that consolidated his control over Hungary, a 9.5 million-person country in Central Europe. President Tam\u00e1s Sulyok officially announced the election date on Facebook, confirming a date long anticipated. The campaign has been active for months, with Magyar touring the country and Orb\u00e1n traveling to Washington and Moscow, making promises. Magyar, 44, a former diplomat and lawyer, has positioned himself against widespread corruption and pledged to unlock billions in frozen EU funds due to rule-of-law breaches. While Orb\u00e1n, 62, promotes himself as a 'safe choice' in an unstable world and maintains close ties with Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and China, he has strained relations with the EU, accusing it of fueling the war in Ukraine. Magyar, in contrast, advocates a pro-Western foreign policy, criticizing both China and Russia, and pledges to strengthen Hungary\u2019s role within NATO and the EU. His movement, known as the 'Tisza islands,' consists of grassroots organizations that have driven his rising popularity despite smear campaigns. His anti-immigration stance is stricter than Orb\u00e1n\u2019s. Recent polls suggest that besides Fidesz and Tisza, the far-right party Our Homeland may cross the 5% threshold to enter parliament, while all other parties, including the left-wing Democratic Coalition, remain below the threshold.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 10:59 AM\nSource:[The Times of Israel FR](https://fr.timesofisrael.com/les-hongrois-appeles-aux-urnes-le-12-avril-pour-elire-leur-nouvelle-assemblee/)\n\n**Parliamentary elections set for April 12 in Hungary as Orb\u00e1n appears weakened in polls - ProtoThema English**\nHungary has scheduled its parliamentary elections for April 12, 2026, as announced by President Tam\u00e1s Sulyok via Facebook, formalizing a previously circulated date. Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who has led the country since 2010, is trailing in independent polls, with recent surveys indicating that his Fidesz party holds approximately 35% support, while the opposition movement Tisza, led by former ally P\u00e9ter Magyar, leads at around 50%. Analyst Szabolcs Pek of the Hungarian Iranytu Institute noted the stable double-digit lead for Tisza since last spring, with 90 days remaining until the vote. The political landscape also includes the far-right party 'Our Homeland' expected to cross the 5% threshold and gain parliamentary seats, while other parties\u2014including the center-left Democratic Coalition\u2014remain below the threshold. Economic stagnation, dissatisfaction with public services, and child protection scandals have contributed to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s declining popularity.

On January 10, 2026, the ruling party Fidesz \u2013 Hungarian Civic Union officially nominated incumbent Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as its candidate for the position of head of government in the upcoming parliamentary elections.

The ruling party Fidesz-KDNP, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has held power for 15 years and is seeking re-election, though its position has weakened. According to research by the independent Hungarian Institute for Political Studies (Policy Solutions), public confidence in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has declined, with growing criticism of Hungary\u2019s international standing and EU fund freezes attributed to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s administration. A majority of Hungarians now view opposition leader P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay of the Tisza party as a more suitable candidate than Orb\u00e1n, with support for M\u00e1rki-Zay rising even among undecided voters. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s campaign focuses on maintaining neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, warning that pro-Bruce-loyal candidates would drag Hungary into war. However, public fear of war has decreased: in 2023, 59% feared Hungary\u2019s involvement; by autumn 2025, this dropped to 46%, and further to 43% by late 2025. Another key issue is opposition to Ukraine\u2019s EU accession, with 64% of Hungarians opposing it and only 31% supporting it by 2025. Orb\u00e1n has leveraged this sentiment, aligning with farmers\u2019 protests against EU subsidies. The Tisza party, a pro-European liberal force, criticizes Orb\u00e1n\u2019s foreign policy, especially ties with Russia, China, and Turkey, and promotes cooperation with the EU and Ursula von der Leyen. Tisza has gained popularity due to its competence narrative and anti-corruption stance, with 58% of respondents believing it is more capable than Fidesz in handling state affairs. The Democratic Coalition (DK), led by Kl\u00e1ra Dobrev, is weaker but may coordinate with Tisza. The far-right 'Our Homeland' (Mi Haz\u00e1nk), led by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3thk\u00e1cs, has grown steadily, gaining nearly 7% in the 2024 European Parliament elections, advocating for Hungarian rights in Transcarpathia and promoting anti-immigrant, anti-Islamic, and anti-Semitic views. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has tightened media control through a state oversight body targeting foreign-funded outlets, drawing criticism from the EU for restricting press freedom. The opposition uses this to discredit Orb\u00e1n. Despite Orb\u00e1n\u2019s strong base of around two million voters, political analysts like Zolt\u00e1n Kiseli suggest this is insufficient for victory. The outcome will shape Hungary\u2019s future: a Fidesz win would maintain resistance to Ukraine\u2019s EU integration and skepticism toward EU-led escalation; a Tisza victory would align Hungary more closely with EU pro-Ukraine policies. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s foreign policy, including close ties with U.S. figures like Donald Trump and JD Vance, suggests a strategic positioning in a shifting global order, though he avoids explicitly defining it.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 09:29 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/article/012bea5a)\n\n**Hungarian Elections 2026: Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Struggle Against Rising Opposition and Eroding Legitimacy**\nHungary is preparing for the 2026 parliamentary elections, which pose the most significant challenge to Viktor Orb\u00e1n's rule in over 15 years. Orb\u00e1n's long-standing political model\u2014based on media control, opposition fragmentation, conflict with the EU, and balancing between Washington and Moscow\u2014is under unprecedented pressure. Internal scandals, economic stagnation, public fatigue, and the rise of a conservative challenger from within his own camp, Peter Madjar (leader of the TISZA party), have weakened his grip. Despite extending a state of emergency until May 2026\u2014justified by 'war threats' from Ukraine but used to consolidate power\u2014Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party has lost its previous dominance. The government's media machine is faltering, attempts to criminalize opposition leaders are failing due to EU resistance (e.g., the European Parliament rejecting Madjar\u2019s prosecution), and financial constraints from past populist policies have eroded public trust. Polls show Madjar\u2019s TISZA party gaining ground, sometimes leading or tying with Fidesz. A strategic opposition coalition is forming, with parties like the Humanists (Humanist\u00e1k) supporting Madjar\u2019s candidacy while advancing progressive agendas (e.g., women\u2019s rights, EU integration, Ukraine support) to broaden appeal. This coordination aims to overcome ideological divides without formal coalition. Orb\u00e1n attempts to bolster his image as a 'peace broker' by positioning Hungary as a potential venue for Trump-Putin talks and emphasizing ties with Russia\u2014especially on energy projects like Paks-2. However, U.S. support is overstated; American officials have downplayed claims of economic guarantees, and Poland\u2019s PiS party lost power despite Trump\u2019s backing, demonstrating that foreign backing alone cannot overcome domestic decline. The 2026 election is thus a test of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s model, with internal legitimacy\u2014driven by economic performance and public trust\u2014now more critical than external narratives of neutrality or global influence.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 23, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/geopolitics/ru/vybory-vengrii-2026-rejting-orbana-madjara-kto-pobedit_n2965530)\n\n**Hungarians Take to Streets Demanding Government Resignation: Is Orban's Rule at Risk?**\nMass protests have erupted in Hungary over a scandalous video showing a teenager being abused in a juvenile correctional facility. Opposition leader Peter Madjar, candidate for prime minister and head of the pro-European 'Tisza' party, has led several large-scale demonstrations demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Political analyst Vadim Trukhachev states that these protests are a normal part of European political culture and part of the lead-up to the 2026 parliamentary elections, which will determine the next prime minister. While the protests are not revolutionary in nature, they reflect strong political mobilization. Madjar, known for his anti-Russian stance and popularity in urban areas, is seen as a serious challenger to Orban, who has been in power since 2010 and has grown unpopular among liberal circles and those frustrated by Hungary\u2019s strained relations with the EU, which have resulted in frozen EU funds worth several tens of billions of dollars. Trukhachev predicts that although Orban\u2019s party will likely win the 2026 elections, it will lose its parliamentary majority, leading to a coalition of opposition parties gaining control of the parliament.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 15, 2025 09:02 PM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/politics/world/svergnut-orbana-vengry-vyshli-na-ulicy-i-trebuyut-otstavki-pravitelstva)\n\n**Hungary passes bill reinforcing president's post**\nHungary's parliament, dominated by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party, passed a constitutional bill requiring a two-thirds majority to remove the president from office, raising the threshold from a simple majority. The vote, 134 in favor, 49 against, and two abstentions, met the supermajority needed for a constitutional amendment. The change strengthens the largely ceremonial presidency, currently held by Tamas Sulyok, an Orban ally whose term ends in 2030. The president retains limited powers, including the ability to veto legislation or refer bills to the Constitutional Court\u2014currently led by another Orban ally, Peter Polt. The reform was reportedly requested by President Sulyok, who cited concerns over potential abuse of the current legal framework. Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, confirmed the government accepted the president\u2019s observation. The opposition TISZA party, led by Peter Magyar, criticized the move as evidence that Orban\u2019s government fears losing power in the upcoming 2026 parliamentary elections, in which TISZA currently holds a 10-point lead in opinion polls. The first-past-the-post system makes seat shifts possible with small vote changes, but a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly remains unlikely for any party in the near term.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 05:37 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/hungary-passes-bill-reinforcing-presidents-post/a-75096979)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
