This corrects results *toward* proportionality.\n\n---\n\n### Hungary's Novel \"Winner Compensation\" Departure\nUnder Fidesz's reformed system, **winning parties also receive compensation votes**. The logic: votes cast beyond the minimum needed to win a district are deemed \"surplus\" or \"lost,\" and are added to the winner's national party-list totals.\n\n**Example provided:**\n- Red party wins a district with 500 votes; Green gets 200; Yellow gets 100.\n- Red only needed 201 votes to win, so **299 \"surplus\" votes** are added to Red's party-list tally.\n- Green and Yellow also receive their votes as compensation (as under the old system).\n\n**Effect:** Winners are rewarded *twice* \u2014 once with the district seat, and again with boosted list-seat allocations. This pushes results **further from proportionality**, not closer.\n\n---\n\n### Strategic Design and Political Context\n- The system was designed when Fidesz was the clear plurality party facing a **fragmented opposition**.\n- Against a divided opposition (e.g., four parties each getting 100 votes vs. Fidesz's 500), Fidesz would gain **399 winner compensation votes**.\n- If the opposition unified (combining to 400 votes), Fidesz's compensation drops to just **99 votes** \u2014 explaining why opposition unity was strategically essential.\n- Scheppele notes that gerrymandered districts make it nearly impossible for a unified opposition to win districts by large enough margins to benefit from the same mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### Election Administration Concerns\n- The Election Commission was **reorganized twice** after 2010, with opposition members removed.\n- Current (2014) Commission members were nominated by a former Fidesz vice-president and elected by the Fidesz-dominated parliament; **no opposition members** hold permanent seats.\n- The head of the Election Office is a **former Fidesz government official**.\n- During campaigns, parties running national lists can add delegates to the Commission, potentially diluting Fidesz allies' dominance \u2014 but the Election Office itself gains no opposition representation.\n- Scheppele flags \"worrying signs\" of **inaccurate and misleading information** from election officials, to be detailed in a subsequent post.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaway\nScheppele's central argument is that Hungary's winner compensation system is **unique among European PR systems** and was deliberately engineered to convert plurality vote shares into constitutional supermajorities, particularly in a fragmented political landscape. The opposition needed to both unify *and* outperform Fidesz by 6\u20138 percentage points just to achieve a simple parliamentary majority.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
