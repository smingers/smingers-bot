Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Jerusalem Post (Feb 17, 2026):** Credible publication with Israeli editorial perspective. Reports ISW assessment and named experts (Dr. Hamidreza Azizi, Roger Macmillan, Annika Ganzeveld) on post-Khamenei positioning. These are identifiable, credible experts. Core finding: factions are positioning for post-Khamenei transition but analysts frame this as preparation for his eventual death, not imminent forced removal. Moderate-high quality.

**Asharq Al-Awsat (undated in summary):** Reputable Arabic-language outlet. Describes Khamenei facing "gravest crisis" with US strike force gathering. Factual on military deployments and diplomatic context. Expert opinion from Karim Sadjadpour (Carnegie) is credible. Moderate-high quality.

**The Sun (Feb 9, 2026):** Tabloid. Reports Khamenei's absence from Feb 8 Air Force meeting. Core fact (absence) corroborated by multiple better sources. Claims about underground shelter and son running operations attributed vaguely — treat with caution. Low-moderate quality.

**GB News (Feb 10, 2026):** Right-leaning British broadcaster. Same absence story. Core fact corroborated. Vague sourcing on operational claims. Low-moderate quality.

**WION (undated):** Reports threatening Iranian banner and Khamenei's absence. Notes June 2025 precedent for sudden US strikes. Moderate quality.

**Gulf News (Feb 9, 2026):** More reliable regional outlet. Confirms absence, notes Major General Mousavi presided instead. No official explanation. Moderate-high quality.

**Valor Econômico (Feb 21, 2026):** Brazilian financial outlet. Synthesizes Khamenei's crisis situation. Cites Karim Sadjadpour (credible). Moderate quality.

**Axios reports (Feb 20-21, 2026) via multiple Russian/international outlets:** Multiple sources citing Axios reporting that Trump is considering eliminating Khamenei and his son, with potential action as early as Feb 21-22. These are secondary sources citing Axios. The Axios original is credible; the claim is attributed to unnamed US officials/advisors. Moderate quality on the underlying Axios report.

**Benzinga (Feb 19, 2026):** Financial/prediction market outlet. Reports Kalshi market odds: 30% probability Khamenei removed by April 1, 2026; 48% by September 1, 2026. Over $21.8M wagered. This is market data, not expert opinion, but represents aggregated crowd wisdom. Moderate quality.

**News18 (Feb 20, 2026):** Indian outlet. Good analytical piece on Khamenei's "brinkmanship." Notes he gave a Feb 17 speech in Tehran (important — suggests he was alive and functioning as of Feb 17). Moderate quality.

**AFP/GEO TV/Le Figaro (Nov 3, 2025):** High-quality sources reporting Khamenei's November 2025 statements. Confirms he was still actively making public statements as of November 2025.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**

1. **Khamenei gave a speech on February 17, 2026** (News18 reports this directly) — just 4 days before the question opened. This confirms he was alive and functioning as Supreme Leader as recently as Feb 17. This is strong evidence against imminent departure due to health alone.

2. **No IRGC disloyalty reported** — Multiple credible sources (Jerusalem Post, NPR, BBC) note that the IRGC remains loyal. This is the key structural stabilizing factor. Without IRGC defection, regime change is extremely unlikely in a 38-day window.

3. **Resolution criteria explicitly exclude health withdrawal** — Even if Khamenei is incapacitated, the regime maintaining the fiction of his authority would NOT resolve Yes. This significantly constrains the resolution pathway.

**Moderate evidence:**

4. **Khamenei broke 37-year tradition by missing Feb 8 Air Force meeting** — Corroborated by Gulf News, WION, GB News, The Sun. This is a significant signal of deteriorating health or security concerns, but not determinative of departure.

5. **Axios report (Feb 20-21) on US considering eliminating Khamenei** — If credible, this represents a potential Yes pathway. However, unnamed sources, no decision made, and even if strikes occur, killing Khamenei specifically is not guaranteed. Moderate weight.

6. **Kalshi prediction markets at 30% for April 1 departure** — $21.8M wagered provides some signal. Markets can be wrong, especially on tail events, but this is notable. However, prediction markets on political events in authoritarian states can be driven by sentiment rather than information.

7. **Factional maneuvering for post-Khamenei era** — Jerusalem Post/ISW analysis. Suggests internal actors believe transition is coming but analysts frame it as preparation for death, not imminent forced removal.

**Weak evidence:**

8. **Reports of Khamenei in underground bunker, son running operations** — Attributed to vague "Iranian outlets" in tabloid sources. Unverified. Weak.

9. **Economic collapse, protests** — Real but insufficient alone for regime change in 38 days without IRGC defection.

10. **US military armada deployment** — Real, but US strikes don't automatically remove Khamenei as Supreme Leader.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The prediction window is **38 days** (Feb 21 to April 1, 2026).

If halved to ~19 days: Probability would drop significantly to perhaps 8-10%, as the window for any of the Yes scenarios (US strike killing Khamenei, regime collapse, natural death + formal succession) becomes even narrower.

If doubled to ~76 days: Probability would rise to perhaps 20-25%, as health deterioration, potential US strikes, and internal political dynamics have more time to play out.

The short 38-day window is a significant constraint. Even in the most volatile political situations, formal leadership changes in authoritarian states rarely happen within such short windows without a clear precipitating event already underway.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting from outside view base rate of 12%:**

**Upward adjustments:**
- Khamenei's Feb 8 absence from a 37-year tradition is genuinely alarming (+2%)
- Axios report of US considering eliminating Khamenei with potential action as early as Feb 21-22 is a significant escalation signal (+3%)
- Kalshi markets at 30% for April 1 suggest informed crowd sees higher probability than my base rate (+2%)
- Unprecedented combination of health crisis, military defeat, economic collapse, and external pressure (+1%)

**Downward adjustments:**
- Khamenei gave a speech on Feb 17 — just 4 days before question opened, suggesting he was still functioning (-2%)
- Resolution criteria explicitly exclude health withdrawal — narrows pathways significantly (-2%)
- No IRGC disloyalty — key structural stabilizer (-2%)
- Khamenei has survived multiple "gravely ill" reports before (2015, 2022) (-1%)
- US strike targeting Khamenei specifically is uncertain even if strikes occur (-1%)
- Factional maneuvering is framed by named experts as preparation for death, not imminent forced removal (-1%)

**Net adjustment from 12%:** +7% - 9% = approximately -2%, suggesting ~10-15% range.

The Kalshi market at 30% is notable but I'm skeptical it fully accounts for the strict resolution criteria (health withdrawal doesn't count) and the very short 38-day window. The market may be pricing in longer-term removal scenarios that bleed into this contract.

The most plausible Yes pathway remains a US military strike that kills Khamenei or triggers regime collapse. I estimate:
- P(US strikes Iran within 38 days) ≈ 20-30%
- P(Khamenei killed/regime collapses given strikes) ≈ 15-25%
- P(Internal collapse/natural death + formal succession within 38 days) ≈ 3-5%
- Combined: ~8-14%

I'll settle on approximately **13%** as my inside view prediction.

Probability calibration:

The outside view base rate was 12%. Current evidence provides modest upward pressure from the Axios assassination consideration report and market signals, but significant downward pressure from the strict resolution criteria, Khamenei's Feb 17 speech, IRGC loyalty, and the very short 38-day window. I calibrate at 13%.

Checklist:

1. **Resolution criteria paraphrase:** Will Khamenei formally cease to be Supreme Leader (death, deposition, indefinite flight) before April 1, 2026? Health withdrawal alone doesn't count.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 12% — my final prediction of 13% is appropriately anchored to this.

3. **Consistency check:** "13 out of 100 times, Khamenei formally ceases to be Supreme Leader before April 1, 2026." This seems reasonable given the severe but not immediately terminal situation.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - Khamenei gave a speech Feb 17 (4 days ago) — still functioning ✓
   - No IRGC disloyalty reported — key stabilizer ✓
   - Axios report of US considering eliminating Khamenei — plausible Yes pathway ✓
   - Resolution criteria exclude health withdrawal — constrains pathways ✓
   - Kalshi at 30% for April 1 — market signal, but may not account for strict criteria ✓

5. **Blind spot:** A sudden US military strike killing Khamenei over the Feb 21-22 weekend (per Axios) would make a 13% forecast look too low. This is the scenario most likely to make my forecast look silly. If I believed the Axios report fully, I'd push to 20%+. But unnamed sources and the history of such reports being inflated keep me at 13%.

6. **Status quo:** Khamenei remains Supreme Leader. The world changes slowly; even in crises, 38 days is very short for formal leadership change in an authoritarian state with a loyal security apparatus.

Probability: 13%
