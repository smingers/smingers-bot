Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**GB News/MSN (Feb 10, 2026):** Reports Khamenei's absence from the annual Air Force commanders meeting — a 37-year consecutive streak broken. No official explanation given. Hassan Khomeini substituted. GB News is a tabloid-leaning outlet, but the factual claim (absence from meeting) is corroborated by other sources. Moderate reliability on the core fact.

**BBC Article (Jan 16, 2026):** High-quality source. Reports Khamenei hiding in a bunker, ongoing protests driven by economic grievances, Trump threatening action. Expert opinions from Arash Azizi (Yale), Ali Ansari (St Andrews), and Sanam Vakil (Chatham House) — all identifiable, credible experts. Key insight: no significant IRGC disloyalty detected despite unrest.

**Wikipedia on Next Supreme Leader Election:** Useful background but Wikipedia quality varies. Notes succession planning underway, IRGC potentially already acting as de facto rulers, and Khamenei's June 2025 nomination of three successor clerics. Treat with moderate caution.

**AGSI Analysis (post-May 2024 Raisi death):** Credible think-tank analysis. Notes IRGC preference for a weak successor. Argues foreign/security policy unlikely to change regardless of succession. Useful structural analysis.

**NPR (July 9, 2025):** High-quality source. Expert opinions from Vali Nasr (Johns Hopkins), Afshan Ostovar (Naval Postgraduate School), Ali Vaez (ICG). Vaez's suggestion that Khamenei may be the last Supreme Leader is notable but speculative. Key fact: succession planning accelerated post-June 2025 war.

**Stimson Center (Nov 12, 2025):** Anonymous Tehran-based analyst, vouched for by Barbara Slavin (credible Iran expert). Most detailed account of Khamenei's post-war incapacitation. Reports cognitive impairment, governance paralysis, state media manipulation. High analytical value but anonymity limits full verification.

**Al Jazeera (June 18, 2025):** Factual reporting on Iran-Israel war dynamics. Reliable news source. Confirms the scale of the conflict and Khamenei's public statements (read by others on state TV).

**Jerusalem Post (June 17, 2025):** Israeli publication with editorial bias toward Israeli government perspective. Claims about Khamenei's mental breakdown sourced to opposition/unnamed intelligence — treat with caution. Useful for Israeli strategic framing.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive chronology synthesizing multiple sources. Well-organized. Quality depends on underlying sources, but the chronological structure and cross-referencing is useful. The February 2026 World Jewish Congress report echoing 2015 cancer claims should be treated skeptically.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are relevant:

1. **Autocratic leaders with severe health issues dying/departing within 6 weeks**: Very narrow class. Leaders like Khomeini (died after prolonged illness), Kim Jong-il (died after stroke), etc. Base rate for departure within any specific 6-week window is low even for seriously ill leaders — perhaps 5-15% given the short window.

2. **Supreme Leaders/autocrats being deposed by revolution or coup within 6 weeks**: Historical examples (Shah 1979, Ceaușescu 1989, Gaddafi 2011) suggest these events are rare and typically require months of escalation. The current Iranian situation shows protests and instability but no imminent collapse signal comparable to late 1978 Iran or late 1989 Romania.

3. **Leaders who miss key annual events and then depart within weeks**: Very small sample. Missing a single annual event is concerning but not determinative. Khamenei missed multiple events in mid-2025 and still remained in power through November 2025.

4. **Prediction markets/forecasting questions on leader departure**: These typically assign low probabilities (5-20%) even for leaders in precarious situations unless there's an imminent trigger.

The most suitable reference class is **autocratic leaders with documented severe health issues and political instability, probability of formal departure within a ~6-week window**. Base rate: approximately 5-10%.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question window is from February 21 to April 1, 2026 — approximately **38 days**.

Historical patterns:
- Khamenei has survived multiple rounds of "gravely ill" reports (2015, 2022) without departing
- He survived the June 2025 war crisis and remained in power through at least November 2025
- The 38-day window is very short; even rapidly deteriorating situations (like the Shah's departure) took months to culminate
- The Shah's departure in January 1979 came after ~18 months of escalating protests; Iran's current protests, while serious, haven't reached that intensity of organized opposition
- No IRGC disloyalty has been reported — this is the key stabilizing factor

**(d) Justification**

**Factors favoring Yes (departure before April 1, 2026):**
- Khamenei is 86 with reported advanced prostate cancer and cognitive impairment
- Broke a 37-year streak by missing the February 8 Air Force meeting
- Governance paralysis, factional infighting, economic collapse (49% inflation, rial at 1M/dollar)
- Ongoing protests with economic grievances
- US-Iran tensions extremely high with reported 90% chance of US military action (Axios, Feb 18)
- Trump has openly discussed targeting Khamenei
- Succession nominations already made (June 2025)
- Post-war isolation and reliance on pre-recorded communications

**Factors favoring No (remains Supreme Leader through April 1, 2026):**
- No confirmed IRGC disloyalty — the key stabilizing factor
- Khamenei has survived multiple health crises and "gravely ill" reports before
- The resolution criteria require formal cessation, deposition, or indefinite flight — not just incapacitation
- "Withdrawal from duties due to health issues" explicitly does NOT count
- Even if health is failing, the formal succession process takes time
- Iranian state has strong incentives to maintain the fiction of Khamenei's authority
- 38-day window is extremely short for regime change
- Protests, while serious, lack the organizational structure seen in 1978-79 Iran
- No credible reports of imminent coup, assassination, or regime collapse as of Feb 21

The resolution criteria are notably strict: requires formal cessation, deposition, or indefinite flight. Health-related withdrawal doesn't count. Even if Khamenei is effectively incapacitated, the regime could maintain the fiction of his authority (as they have been doing with archival footage) without triggering resolution. A US military strike killing him would resolve Yes, but that's a separate contingency.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for an autocratic leader formally departing within any 38-day window, even under severe stress, is low — perhaps 3-8%. The current situation is unusually stressed (health, war aftermath, economic collapse, US threats), which elevates the probability above the baseline. However:

- The strict resolution criteria (not just health withdrawal) significantly constrains resolution pathways
- The IRGC's continued loyalty is the key stabilizing factor
- Khamenei has survived similar or worse situations before
- The 38-day window is very short

The US military strike scenario (which could kill Khamenei or trigger regime collapse) is perhaps the most plausible Yes pathway. Reports of ~90% chance of US action within "weeks" are alarming but come from a single Axios report and may be inflated. Even if US strikes occur, they might not remove Khamenei specifically.

I estimate:
- P(US strikes Iran within 38 days) ≈ 25-35% (elevated by reports but uncertain)
- P(Khamenei killed/deposed given US strikes) ≈ 15-25%
- P(Regime collapse/Khamenei flees from internal causes) ≈ 3-5%
- P(Natural death + formal succession within 38 days) ≈ 3-5%

Combined: roughly 10-15%, with significant uncertainty.

Outside View Prediction:
12%
