Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Jerusalem Post (Feb 17, 2026)** – Reports on internal Iranian power consolidation post-Khamenei, citing ISW, Dr. Hamidreza Azizi (German Institute for International and Security Affairs), Roger Macmillan (former Iran International director), and Annika Ganzeveld (AEI). Quality: moderate-high for named expert opinions. Key factual claim: Defense Council established independently of SNSC. Key opinion: factions positioning for post-Khamenei era, not imminent removal.

2. **Asharq Al-Awsat (undated, ~Feb 2026)** – Describes Khamenei's "gravest crisis," economic collapse, January protests, military strikes. Quality: moderate (regional outlet with credibility). Factual: protests crushed with "thousands of lives." Opinion: crisis framing. No named experts quoted.

3. **The Sun (Feb 9, 2026)** – Tabloid report on Khamenei missing Air Force Day meeting. Quality: low-moderate (tabloid). Factual: absence confirmed by multiple sources. Claims about underground shelter and son running operations attributed vaguely to "Iranian outlets" – weak sourcing.

4. **GB News (Feb 10, 2026)** – Similar report on Khamenei's absence. Quality: low-moderate. Corroborates absence fact. Claims about Masoud Khamenei running daily operations weakly sourced.

5. **WION News (Feb 2026)** – Tehran banner threatening Israel, Khamenei's absence noted. Quality: moderate. Cannot verify banner images independently. Factual: absence from Feb 8 meeting confirmed.

6. **Gulf News (Feb 9, 2026)** – Khamenei skips annual Air Force meeting, replaced by Major General Mousavi. Quality: moderate-high for Gulf region. Factual: absence confirmed, no official explanation. No speculation about underground shelters.

7. **Axios (via multiple Russian outlets, Feb 20-21, 2026)** – Reports US considering elimination of Khamenei and son. Quality: Axios is credible; Russian outlets are secondary sources. Key fact: Pentagon has prepared contingency plans including targeting Khamenei. Key caveat: "no decision has been made" and "no one, including Trump himself, knows which scenario will be chosen." This is a consideration, not an imminent action.

8. **Benzinga/Kalshi (Feb 19, 2026)** – Prediction market data: 30% probability of Khamenei removal by April 1, 2026; $21.8M wagered. Quality: market data is informative but prediction markets on geopolitical events can be subject to sentiment and thin liquidity biases.

9. **News18 (Feb 20, 2026)** – Analysis of Khamenei's brinkmanship. Quality: moderate. Factual: Feb 17 speech where Khamenei dismissed US military threats. Key opinion: Khamenei's core calculation is "cost of surrender is higher than risk of conflict."

10. **Economic Times/Valor Econômico (Feb 20-21, 2026)** – Profiles of Khamenei's power and crisis. Quality: moderate-high. Cites Karim Sadjadpour (Carnegie Endowment) as named expert. Key opinion: Khamenei maintains absolute control through IRGC/Basij; has shown "heroic flexibility" historically.

11. **GEO TV/AFP/Kommersant (Nov 3, 2025)** – Khamenei's conditions for US cooperation. Quality: high (AFP). Factual: Khamenei publicly stated conditions. Historical context only.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Khamenei's Feb 8 absence from Air Force Day** (confirmed by Gulf News, GB News, WION, The Sun – multiple independent sources): This is the most significant factual anomaly. He has attended every year since 1989, including during COVID. However, absence from a ceremonial meeting ≠ removal from power. This is weak evidence for resolution but strong evidence of health/security concerns.

- **Multiple independent sources confirm regime consolidation is occurring** (Jerusalem Post citing ISW, Azizi, Macmillan, Ganzeveld): All frame this as preparation for Khamenei's *eventual death*, not imminent removal. This is strong evidence *against* resolution by April 1.

- **Khamenei gave a public speech on Feb 17** (News18): He publicly dismissed US military threats. This is strong evidence he is still functioning as Supreme Leader as of Feb 17, just 4 days before the question opened.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Axios report on US considering Khamenei elimination** (Feb 20-21): Credible outlet, but explicitly states no decision made. Historical base rate of such plans materializing within weeks is very low. Moderate evidence of elevated risk, not imminent action.

- **Prediction market at 30% by April 1** (Kalshi/Benzinga): Markets have $21.8M wagered, suggesting serious engagement. However, prediction markets on geopolitical events often overestimate dramatic outcomes due to availability bias and narrative momentum. Moderate evidence to consider but not definitive.

- **IRGC/regime internal maneuvering** (Jerusalem Post): Factions positioning for post-Khamenei era is consistent with anticipation of death, not coup. Moderate evidence against near-term forced removal.

**Weak evidence:**
- Claims about underground shelter, son running operations (The Sun, GB News): Poorly sourced, attributed to unnamed "Iranian outlets." Weak evidence.

- January protests "thousands killed" (Asharq Al-Awsat): Significant domestic unrest, but IRGC has repeatedly suppressed protests. Weak evidence for resolution.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Days remaining**: ~39 days (Feb 21 to April 1, 2026).
- **If halved (~20 days)**: Probability would drop significantly, perhaps to 4-6%, as the window for a US strike, successful coup, or sudden death narrows considerably.
- **If doubled (~80 days)**: Probability would rise, perhaps to 12-18%, as more time allows for US military action, health deterioration, or internal regime collapse.

The 39-day window is short. Even in highly volatile situations (Arab Spring, 2003 Iraq), regime changes rarely occur on a 6-week timeline without clear triggering events already in motion.

**(d) Justification**

**Factors pushing upward from 1.5% base:**

1. **US military planning for Khamenei elimination** (Axios, Feb 20-21): This is qualitatively different from historical base rates. The explicit consideration of decapitation strikes, combined with a US naval armada in position, represents elevated risk. However, "considering" ≠ "executing." Historical precedent: US considered many such options (Saddam, Gaddafi, Assad) and acted only in specific circumstances. Adjust: +3-4%.

2. **Khamenei's health signals** (missed Feb 8 meeting, bunker reports, reduced public presence since June 2025 war): These are consistent with serious health deterioration. Actuarial risk for an 86-year-old with reported prostate cancer metastasis over 39 days: roughly 1-1.5%. But resolution requires formal cessation, not just death – death would likely resolve Yes if confirmed. Adjust: +1%.

3. **Prediction markets at 30%**: This is a significant signal but I believe these markets are overweighted by narrative momentum and the dramatic nature of current events. Markets on geopolitical events with binary outcomes often exhibit overconfidence. I discount this heavily but note it as a signal. Adjust: +2% (not taking market at face value).

4. **Regime stability factors pushing downward**: Khamenei gave a public speech Feb 17 (4 days before question opened). IRGC remains cohesive. Regime elites have strong incentives to maintain stability. Internal coup would require IRGC consensus that doesn't appear to exist. The Assembly of Experts has not convened. No credible reports of imminent formal removal.

5. **US strike probability**: Even with planning, a strike that kills Khamenei within 39 days requires: Trump decision → execution → confirmation → credible reporting. Each step has uncertainty. Historical rate of such strikes materializing within weeks of "consideration" reports: very low (~5-10% conditional on planning being real).

**Net assessment**: The outside view base rate of ~1.5% should be adjusted upward due to:
- Genuinely elevated US military threat (unprecedented in recent decades)
- Khamenei's health signals
- But counterbalanced by: his continued public functioning as of Feb 17, IRGC cohesion, regime's strong survival incentives

I estimate the true probability at approximately **8-10%**, reflecting:
- ~3-4% probability of US/Israeli strike killing or deposing Khamenei within 39 days
- ~1.5% probability of sudden health-related death/incapacitation meeting resolution criteria
- ~1% probability of internal coup or forced removal
- ~2-3% probability of other scenarios (flight, capture)

The prediction market at 30% seems substantially overweighted. The Axios report of "considering" elimination plans is significant but historically such plans rarely execute on 6-week timelines. Khamenei's Feb 17 public speech is strong evidence he remains functional.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view gives 1.5%. Current circumstances are genuinely elevated above historical norms due to:
1. Active US military planning for decapitation (unprecedented in modern Iran context)
2. Naval armada positioned
3. Khamenei's health signals and reduced public presence
4. Internal regime maneuvering suggesting elites anticipate transition

However, the status quo is that Khamenei remains Supreme Leader as of Feb 17 (4 days ago), gave a public speech, and the regime's survival apparatus remains intact. The 39-day window is short. I settle on approximately **9%**.

---

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Khamenei formally cease to be Supreme Leader (death, deposition, flight in context of regime change) before April 1, 2026? ~39 days.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 1.5% (actuarial + historical exit rates for elderly autocrats over 40-day windows). Final prediction of 9% represents a ~6x upward revision justified by unprecedented US military planning and health signals.

3. **Consistency check**: "9 out of 100 times, Khamenei ceases to be Supreme Leader before April 1, 2026." This seems reasonable given elevated but not imminent threats.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Khamenei gave public speech Feb 17 (4 days ago) – still functioning ✓
   - Axios: US considering elimination plans, no decision made ✓
   - Missed Feb 8 Air Force Day meeting – health/security concern ✓
   - Jerusalem Post: experts say factions preparing for death, not coup ✓
   - Prediction markets at 30% – likely overweighted ✓

5. **Blind spot**: A sudden US strike this weekend (Feb 21-22 was specifically mentioned in Axios) could kill Khamenei. If this happened, my 9% would look too low. But the Axios report explicitly says "no decision made."

6. **Status quo**: Khamenei remains Supreme Leader with IRGC support. Status quo strongly favors No resolution. Slight nudge toward status quo is warranted.

Probability: 9%
