Analysis:

**Source Analysis:**

1. **GB News/MSN (Feb 10, 2026)**: Reports Khamenei's absence from the annual Air Force commanders meeting — a 37-year streak broken. No official explanation. Tabloid-adjacent outlet but the factual claim (absence) is corroborated by other sources. Moderate quality; the fact itself appears reliable.

2. **BBC ("What next for Iran's supreme leader?" Jan 16, 2026)**: High-quality source. Reports Khamenei hiding in a bunker, Trump's threatening rhetoric, ongoing protests driven by economic grievances, and expert opinions. Key expert opinions: Arash Azizi (Yale) suggests ruling elite may welcome Khamenei's removal; Ali Ansari (St Andrews) says reformists are marginalized; Sanam Vakil (Chatham House) says protests aim to transform governance entirely. Factual: protests ongoing, Khamenei in hiding, IRGC loyalty intact.

3. **Wikipedia on Next Supreme Leader election**: Secondary source aggregating various claims. Notes unverified claims about Khamenei's wartime role being usurped. Useful for structural/constitutional information. Treat specific claims about Khamenei's mental state with caution.

4. **AGSI analysis (post-Raisi crash, 2024)**: Expert analysis noting IRGC preference for a weak successor. Factual: Raisi died May 2024, disrupting succession. Opinion: "little prospect for significant change" in foreign policy.

5. **NPR (July 9, 2025)**: High quality. Expert Ali Vaez (ICG) suggests Khamenei may be the last supreme leader. Vali Nasr (Johns Hopkins) confirms succession planning underway. Factual: 12-day war occurred June 2025, Khamenei was reportedly an Israeli target.

6. **Stimson Center (Nov 12, 2025)**: Anonymous Tehran-based analyst, vouched for by Barbara Slavin (credible Iran expert). Detailed account of governance paralysis, Khamenei's post-war isolation, cognitive decline reports, factional infighting. High analytical quality but anonymity limits verification of specific claims. Key facts: October 20 and November 4 public appearances confirmed; state media using archival footage.

7. **Al Jazeera (June 18, 2025)**: Factual reporting on Iran-Israel war, Day 6. Trump's "easy target" statement, Iranian casualties, military exchanges. Reliable news source.

8. **Jerusalem Post (June 17, 2025)**: Israeli publication with editorial bias toward Israeli security establishment perspective. Claims about Khamenei's mental breakdown sourced to "opposition, exiles, and unnamed regional intelligence" — treat with caution. Factual: Netanyahu's ABC News statement, Israeli strikes on nuclear sites.

9. **Agent Report (chronology)**: Comprehensive synthesis of multiple sources. Well-organized. Appropriately flags uncertainty. Useful for establishing timeline. Quality depends on underlying sources.

**Reference Class Analysis:**

Several reference classes are relevant:

1. **Autocratic leaders ceasing power within a specific 6-week window**: Extremely rare. Most autocrats hold power until death or dramatic regime collapse. Base rate: perhaps 1-3% per year for any given autocrat facing significant pressure, translating to ~0.5-1.5% over 6 weeks.

2. **Aging/ill authoritarian leaders being removed within months**: Historical cases (Shah of Iran 1979, Mubarak 2011, Ben Ali 2011) suggest that even under severe pressure, the process typically takes months to years. The Shah's departure took roughly 12 months of mass protests. Mubarak lasted 18 days of intense protests but after 30 years of rule. Base rate for removal within any given 6-week window even under pressure: ~3-8%.

3. **Supreme Leaders of Iran specifically**: Only one precedent (Khomeini, died in office 1989). No precedent for removal. This reference class is too small to be statistically useful but suggests the institution is designed for permanence.

4. **Leaders who are seriously ill and under external pressure**: More relevant. Even with serious illness + external pressure, formal removal within 6 weeks is uncommon. Leaders tend to cling to power until physically unable.

The most suitable reference class is **autocratic leaders facing simultaneous health decline, external military pressure, and domestic unrest** — perhaps 5-10% chance of formal removal in any given 6-week period under these conditions, but this is generous given the resolution criteria requiring formal cessation (not just incapacitation).

**Timeframe Analysis:**

The question covers approximately **38 days** from February 21 to April 1, 2026. This is a very short window. Historical patterns:
- Even in the most dramatic cases (Shah's Iran), the actual departure came after months of escalating crisis
- Khamenei has survived multiple "imminent removal" narratives (2015 cancer reports, 2022 surgery reports, June 2025 war)
- The resolution criteria specifically excludes "withdrawal from duties due to health issues" — requiring formal deposition, flight from country in regime-change context, or formal cessation
- The status quo is Khamenei remaining Supreme Leader, even if incapacitated

**Justification:**

The evidence strongly suggests Khamenei is in significantly diminished health and political capacity:
- 37-year streak of Air Force meeting attendance broken (Feb 8, 2026)
- Post-war isolation in bunker (June-October 2025)
- Reports of cognitive decline and coma-like episodes
- State media using archival footage
- Succession nominations made (June 2025)
- Active protests, economic collapse, IRGC factional infighting

However, several factors argue against formal removal before April 1:
- IRGC loyalty appears intact (no significant defections reported)
- No active coup or formal succession process initiated
- Iranian authorities consistently deny health reports
- He made public appearances as recently as November 4, 2025
- The resolution criteria is strict — requires formal cessation, not just incapacitation
- US-Iran nuclear talks ongoing (Geneva, Feb 18-20, 2026) suggests some diplomatic engagement continues
- Even the most pessimistic analysts (Vaez, Stimson) frame this as a longer-term trajectory, not imminent

The primary scenarios for Yes resolution before April 1:
1. Death from illness (~5-8% probability given age, reported cancer, 38-day window)
2. US military strike killing him (~3-5% given ongoing nuclear negotiations)
3. Regime collapse/coup leading to flight or deposition (~2-4%)
4. Israeli assassination (~1-2%)

These scenarios have some overlap but are partially independent. Combined probability: roughly 8-15%.

However, I must note that the resolution criteria requires formal cessation — death alone would qualify, but incapacitation/withdrawal does not. The question is whether Khamenei will die, be killed, or be formally deposed within 38 days.

Outside view calibration:

Tethering to base rates: An 86-year-old man with advanced prostate cancer has an annual mortality rate of perhaps 15-25% (given his reported condition). Over 38 days, this translates to roughly 1.5-2.5% from natural causes alone. Adding assassination risk (elevated but US-Iran talks reduce near-term probability), coup risk (low given IRGC loyalty), and formal deposition (very low), I arrive at a combined probability of approximately 8-12%.

The unprecedented missed military meeting and the BBC/Stimson reporting suggest conditions are more acute than typical, warranting a slight upward adjustment from a pure base rate. However, the strict resolution criteria (not mere incapacitation) and the very short 38-day window argue for restraint.

Historical upset rate in this domain: Leaders who appear on the verge of removal often survive longer than expected (Maduro, Kim Jong-un's 2020 disappearance, Khamenei's own 2022 health scare). This argues for some downward adjustment.

I settle on approximately 9% as my outside view prediction.
