Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria paraphrase (tight):
This resolves **Yes** if **credible sources report Ali Khamenei has formally ceased being Iran’s Supreme Leader** (death, deposition, captivity, or indefinite flight) **between Feb 21, 2026 and before Apr 1, 2026**. Mere illness/absence/inactivity is insufficient.

2) Source analysis (what’s new + quality):
- **Jerusalem Post (Feb 17, 2026)**: Mixed news/analysis with identifiable think-tank references (ISW, AEI/CTP) and named experts. Bias risk (Israeli outlet), but the claim “factions positioning for post-Khamenei” is plausible and consistent with succession dynamics. Mostly *analysis*, not a concrete “cessation” trigger. Quality: **medium**.
- **Asharq Al-Awsat (English) (date not explicit in snippet, but current)**: Regional outlet; tends to compile narratives and expert quotes (e.g., Sadjadpour). Mixes fact and framing (“gravest crisis”). Quality: **medium**; useful for context, not decisive.
- **Gulf News (Feb 9, 2026)**: Mainstream regional paper; reports the **absence from Feb 8 Air Force meeting** and that state media downplayed it. This is a *verifiable factual claim* echoed elsewhere. Quality: **medium-high** on the absence fact.
- **GB News/MSN (Feb 10, 2026)**: Politically slanted; reports the same absence and adds speculative claims (tunnels/son running ops). Absence likely true; the rest is weakly sourced. Quality: **low-medium**.
- **The US Sun (Feb 9, 2026)**: Tabloid. Adds sensational claims (handoff to son; imminent strike warnings). Treat as unreliable except where independently corroborated. Quality: **low**.
- **WION (Feb 2026)**: Reports a threatening banner; says it can’t verify images. Also repeats absence narrative and strike fears. Quality: **low-medium**.
- **Valor Econômico (Feb 21, 2026)**: Reputable Brazilian financial press; largely a synthesis with expert context. Not a direct indicator of imminent leadership cessation. Quality: **medium-high**.
- **Axios claim (Feb 20-21, 2026) but seen via Russian/Ukrainian reprints (Charter97, Rambler, Izvestia, Lenta, etc.)**: The underlying Axios item (if accurately represented) is relevant because it introduces a direct mechanism (targeting Khamenei). However, we don’t have the primary Axios text here—only secondary reprints—so details/timing are uncertain. Quality for “options discussed”: **medium**; quality for “strike this weekend” specifics: **low-medium**.
- **Benzinga (Feb 19, 2026) on Kalshi odds**: Good for *market sentiment*, not truth. Prediction markets can overreact to rumors, and this contract window mismatch can mislead. Quality: **medium** as a sentiment indicator.
- **News18 / Economic Times (Feb 20, 2026)**: Explanatory pieces; one asserts Khamenei gave a **Feb 17 speech in Tehran** (if accurate, it argues against immediate incapacitation). These are often syntheses; still, the “he spoke Feb 17” is a concrete counter-signal to “missing/near-death” narratives. Quality: **medium**.

3) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria):
Strong evidence (large weight):
- **Very short remaining window (~39 days)** and **institutional stickiness**: Iran’s system has strong coercive capacity (IRGC/Basij) and succession is designed to preserve regime continuity. Short windows heavily favor “No” absent a clear catalyst.
- **No credible report yet of formal removal, deposition, detention, or flight** within the resolution window (which starts today). Status quo is intact.

Moderate evidence (moderate weight):
- **Khamenei missing a once-annual, high-symbolism military event (Feb 8)** corroborated across multiple outlets (Gulf News, GB News, others). This is meaningful *signal of unusual circumstances* (security, health, or political choreography). However, absence alone does not meet criteria.
- **Reported elite positioning for post-Khamenei governance (JP/ISW/AEI framing)**: increases plausibility of near-term transition *if* health collapses, but also consistent with routine succession planning for an 86-year-old leader.
- **Escalated US-Iran crisis atmosphere** (carriers, threats, talks): increases tail risk of strike/miscalculation.

Weak evidence (small adjustments):
- **Tabloid claims** about tunnels, son taking over daily operations, “imminent strike this weekend,” etc.—plausible in spirit, but not reliable enough to drive big probability moves.
- **Prediction market odds (~30% by Apr 1)**: informative about what traders think, but likely overweighting dramatic headlines and assassination speculation; also markets can be thin/manipulable.

4) Timeframe analysis:
- Time remaining: **39 days** (Feb 21 → Apr 1, 2026).
- If timeframe were **halved (~20 days)**: probability would drop materially because many pathways (succession formalities, coup consolidation) take time. I’d expect roughly **~7–9%**.
- If timeframe were **doubled (~78 days to ~mid-May 2026)**: probability rises meaningfully because natural mortality and crisis dynamics compound; I’d expect roughly **~15–20%** (still not majority absent a clear collapse signal).

5) Justification (inside-view adjustments from the 9% outside view):
Key “Yes” pathways within 39 days:
- **Natural death / sudden medical event** (age 86): elevated vs average leader, but still a short window.
- **Assassination/decapitation strike**: plausibility increased by crisis rhetoric and “options discussed,” but this remains a very high bar politically/strategically (massive escalation, uncertain payoff, retaliation risk).
- **Internal coup/deposition**: historically rare in Iran’s system; would require a coordinated elite move + security control. Current reporting suggests maneuvering, not open rupture.
- **Indefinite flight**: would likely accompany regime collapse in Tehran; not currently the modal trajectory.

What moved me upward from 9%:
- The **multi-source confirmed absence** from the key annual military meeting is a genuine anomaly (moderate upward pressure).
- The **assassination-option reporting** (even if fuzzy via reprints) increases the extreme-tail risk slightly, because it introduces a direct causal mechanism that could resolve the question quickly.

What restrains the move (keeps it far below market’s ~30%):
- **Resolution criteria are strict**: “withdrawal from duties/health issues” doesn’t count; you need credible reporting of formal cessation (death, deposition, captivity, flight).
- **Counter-signal**: reporting that Khamenei delivered a **Feb 17 speech** (if accurate) suggests he is not currently in an acute, publicly undeniable terminal phase.
- **Institutional inertia**: even with ill health, regimes often conceal, delay announcements, and avoid formal transitions inside short windows unless forced by death.

Net effect: modest increase, not a regime-change-level leap.

Probability calibration:
- Outside view base rate given: **9%**.
- Adjustments:
  - +2 pp for the **unusual, corroborated absence** (signals elevated short-term instability/health/security).
  - +1 pp for **increased tail risk** from US “decapitation option” chatter amid heightened tensions (but discounted heavily due to sourcing uncertainty and escalation costs).
  - -1 pp for “likely still functioning recently” counter-signal (reported Feb 17 speech) and the tendency for **false-alarm disappearance narratives** in closed regimes.

Inside-view forecast: **11%**.
Interpretation of ±10%: moving to 21% would imply I think a “death/assassination/coup/flight” outcome is roughly 1-in-5 in 39 days—too high given institutional stickiness and weak confirmation of imminent action. Moving to 1% would ignore the genuine anomalies and elevated crisis environment.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will credible sources report Khamenei **ceased being Supreme Leader** (death/deposition/captivity/flight) **between Feb 21 and before Apr 1, 2026**?
2. Outside view base rate: **9%**.
3. Consistency line: **11 out of 100 times**, Khamenei would cease to be Supreme Leader within this window.
4. Top evidence (most significant):
   - Confirmed anomaly: **missed Feb 8 annual Air Force commanders event** without explanation.
   - **Short 39-day window + regime coercive capacity** favors continuity.
   - **Reports of US considering extreme options** (assassination/decapitation), but sourcing is indirect here.
   - **Succession maneuvering** reported, but mostly as longer-horizon preparation.
5. Blind spot (most likely to make this look silly): A rapid **US/Israeli strike or internal coup** causing sudden death/removal within days; would push probability sharply upward (could justify 20%+ if primary-source confirmations emerged).
6. Status quo outcome: Khamenei remains Supreme Leader (even if hidden/ill), and no formal cessation is credibly reported before Apr 1.

Probability: 11%
