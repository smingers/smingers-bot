Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; how much weight it deserves)
1) **GB News via MSN (Feb 10, 2026) — “missing from key military meeting”**
- **Factual claim:** Khamenei did not attend an annual military event he has historically attended; no official explanation was given; someone else appeared in his place.
- **Quality:** Medium-low. GB News is not a top-tier outlet for Iran internal elite politics; MSN is an aggregator. The *event absence* itself is plausibly checkable, but the *interpretation* (“mystery,” “speculation,” “fled to shelter”) is largely narrative.
- **Use for outside view:** Limited. It signals uncertainty and rumors, but outside view should not lean heavily on a single tabloid-style trigger.

2) **BBC (Jan 16, 2026) — “What next for Iran’s supreme leader?”**
- **Factual vs opinion:** Mix. Facts are mostly cautious; much is expert commentary and scenario analysis.
- **Quality:** High for journalistic standards and sourcing discipline; still, BBC cannot “see inside the bunker,” so it remains partly inferential.
- **Use for outside view:** Moderate. Confirms that serious mainstream analysis treats succession/removal as plausible *in general*, but doesn’t directly set a near-term base rate for removal within ~6 weeks.

3) **Wikipedia: “Next Supreme Leader of Iran election” (as summarized)**
- **Factual vs rumor:** A compilation; includes both constitutional facts (Assembly of Experts, interim council) and many claims attributed to opposition/unverified sources.
- **Quality:** Mixed; good for the *formal process*, weak for estimating *near-term probabilities*.
- **Use for outside view:** Mostly to understand that removal is a discrete, reportable event (death/dismissal/deposition) and that “withdrawal from duties” may not resolve the question.

4) **AGSI (analysis article on Raisi death and succession)**
- **Factual:** Raisi’s death; constitutional mechanics around leadership continuity.
- **Analytical opinions:** IRGC preference for a weak successor; policy continuity.
- **Quality:** Medium-high (specialist policy institute). More about structure than day-to-day health signals.
- **Use for outside view:** Helps anchor that succession planning is institutionalized; doesn’t imply a high short-window probability of Khamenei ceasing to be leader.

5) **NPR (July 2025) on successors**
- **Factual:** War context and heightened succession discussion; named experts.
- **Expert opinion:** How succession may unfold; whether Khamenei could be “last” supreme leader.
- **Quality:** High. But it’s still long-horizon discussion rather than “in the next 39 days.”
- **Use for outside view:** Modest—supports that succession is a live topic, not a fringe rumor.

6) **Stimson Center (Nov 2025) — anonymous Tehran-based analyst**
- **Factual vs claim:** Many assertions about internal paralysis and Khamenei’s impairment are hard to verify independently.
- **Quality:** Medium. The editorial note helps, but anonymity and the nature of claims mean caution.
- **Use for outside view:** Low-moderate. It suggests elevated instability/health risk, but outside view should avoid “rumor cascades” and instead rely on base rates.

7) **Al Jazeera (war/conflict reporting excerpt)**
- **Factual:** Conflict posture, public statements, military movements (typically within AJ’s competence).
- **Quality:** Medium-high for conflict coverage; still not decisive on Khamenei’s immediate tenure.
- **Use for outside view:** Only insofar as “active conflict raises leader-removal risk” as a general principle.

8) **Jerusalem Post (June 2025)**
- **Factual:** Israeli officials’ rhetoric exists; some assassinations of other figures may be factual.
- **Speculation:** Claims about Khamenei’s breakdown/sidelining rely on unnamed sources and a partisan frame.
- **Quality:** Medium-low for internal Iranian politics; higher risk of motivated reasoning.
- **Use for outside view:** Minimal.

9) **Agent report (2020–Feb 2026 chronology)**
- **Value:** Useful synthesis and timeline; however it mixes high-quality items (e.g., NYT 2022 report) with weak ones and reprints/echoes (e.g., old cancer claims resurfacing).
- **Quality:** As a secondary compilation, medium at best; good for “what has been said,” not for “what is true.”
- **Use for outside view:** Mainly to identify what kinds of events plausibly precede leadership cessation (death, assassination, coup), not to set a precise near-term probability.

### (b) Reference class analysis (choosing base rates)
Possible reference classes:

1) **Elderly national leaders (age ~85+) in office: probability of death/exit within ~6 weeks**
- Pros: Directly relevant to “cease to be leader” through natural death or sudden health collapse.
- Cons: Khamenei’s access to elite medical care may reduce mortality vs general population; but stress/war could increase it.

2) **Autocratic leaders under unrest/war: probability of removal (coup/deposition/assassination/flight) within ~6 weeks**
- Pros: Captures non-natural exit risks (assassination, overthrow).
- Cons: These events are rare on a 1–2 month horizon; also Iran’s security apparatus is historically resilient.

3) **Iran-specific: Supreme Leader tenure transitions**
- Pros: Institutional specificity.
- Cons: Sample size is basically **one** transition (1989), so it’s not statistically helpful for a short-window probability.

**Most suitable for an outside-view baseline:** a **blend of (1) + (2)**:
- (1) sets a base rate for *natural death/medical exit*.
- (2) adds a smaller increment for *political/violent removal* in high-tension contexts.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast window:** from **Feb 21, 2026 to Apr 1, 2026**, about **39 days** (~5.6 weeks).
- In most political systems, leadership cessations (especially in tightly controlled autocracies) are **low-frequency** events on such a short horizon.
- Even if health is poor, regimes can keep a leader formally in office while delegating behind the scenes; importantly, the fine print says **withdrawal from duties is not sufficient**.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view reasoning)
Outside view starts with “how often do leaders like this cease to lead in ~6 weeks, absent detailed inside information?”

A reasonable decomposition:

1) **Natural death / sudden terminal event**
- For an **86-year-old male**, annual mortality in wealthy settings is often on the order of **~8–12%/year** (ballpark). Over **39 days (~0.107 years)**, that implies roughly **0.8%–1.3%** risk (using a simple linear hazard approximation).
- Elite protection/medicine might lower risk somewhat, while stress and a conflict environment might raise it; outside view keeps it near ~1%.

2) **Assassination / coup / deposition / forced flight**
- For heads of state globally, the *monthly* risk of removal by irregular means is generally **well below 1%**, but can rise in war/revolution contexts.
- Iran’s regime has shown strong coercive capacity historically, which pulls this down; elevated tensions pull it up.
- A rough outside-view increment here is **~0.5%–1.5%** over 39 days.

Summing these suggests an outside-view range of about **~1.5% to ~3%** for “cease to be supreme leader” within the window.

Because geopolitical “upsets” do occur but remain uncommon on a 6-week horizon—and because the resolution requires *formal cessation* rather than mere incapacity—I’d keep the baseline near the middle of that range rather than pushing it high.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether point:** the demographic/actuarial near-term mortality ballpark for an 86-year-old (~1% over ~6 weeks) is the cleanest quantitative anchor.
- **Add-on for irregular exit:** given Iran’s security state and the short horizon, irregular exit is plausibly of similar magnitude or smaller than near-term mortality.
- **Upset rate consideration:** In geopolitics, “tail events” are real; however, within 39 days, the base rate remains low. This argues against single-digit-to-double-digit probabilities *on outside view alone*.
