Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, factual → opinion, quality)

1. GB News/MSN (10 Feb 26) – First main-stream mention of Khamenei skipping the annual 8 Feb Air-Force Day meeting. Factual core (absence, Hassan Khomeini presided) is corroborated by Gulf News and WION.  Tabloid-leaning framing (“mystery”, “fled to tunnels”) is un-sourced.  Quality: medium-low for interpretation, medium for the single verifiable fact.

2. Gulf News (9 Feb 26) – Same absence, gives official attendee list.  No speculative health claims.  Quality: medium.

3. Jerusalem Post (17 Feb 26) – Analysts at ISW, AEI and others describe elite jockeying for the “post-Khamenei era”.  Clearly labelled expert commentary, no hard claim that transition is imminent.  Quality: medium-high for context, weak for short-window forecasting.

4. BBC explainer (Jan 26) – Reviews constitutional succession, notes public sightings of Khamenei have declined.  Balanced, cautious.  Quality: high.

5. Axios report (20–21 Feb 26) – Cited (and then recycled by many Russian outlets) as “U.S. considering eliminating Khamenei”.  Unnamed US officials; no corroboration yet from Reuters, AP, NYT or WaPo.  Quality: low-moderate; treat as an unverified contingency plan leak.

6. Benzinga (19 Feb 26) – Kalshi prices: 30 % by 1 Apr 26, 42 % by 1 Jul 26.  Objective market data, but thin liquidity and retail skew.  Quality: medium as a sentiment indicator.

7. News18 / Economic Times (20 Feb 26) – Long form essays on Khamenei’s dilemma; largely retrospective analysis.  Quality: medium; little bearing on 5-week horizon.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong:
• None – there is no confirmed report that Khamenei is dead, gravely ill or deposed.

Moderate:
• Triple independent confirmation (GB News, Gulf News, WION) that he missed the 8 Feb ceremony for the first time in 37 yrs – points to either health or security concern.
• Age 86 → actuarial annual mortality ≈ 10 %; scaled to 39 days ≈ 1 %.
• Reputable think-tank (ISW, AEI) noting structural succession jockeying since Jun 25 war – indicates regime preparing for eventuality but not timing.

Weak:
• Axios leak of a hypothetical US decapitation strike – single anonymous sourcing, no supporting evidence it will be executed.
• Rumours of underground shelter / son running the country – unattributed, low-quality media.
• Kalshi market pricing – reflects trader sentiment more than ground truth.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Resolution window: 39 days (21 Feb – 1 Apr 2026).
If the window were doubled (to 78 days) I would add roughly +2 pp; halved (to 19 days) subtract ~1 pp.  The hazard is roughly linear for natural death and very lumpy for coup/strike scenarios.

(d) Justification – inside-view adjustment from 2.37 % baseline

1. Health signal from missed annual event: raises natural-death / incapacitation odds.  Move 1 % → 2 %.  (+1 pp)

2. Heightened US/Israel contingency planning: small non-zero chance of strike.  Assign 1 % (previously 0.5 %).  (+0.5 pp)

3. Succession manoeuvring & elite tension: slight uptick for internal deposition, but regime cohesion still high.  0.3 % → 0.5 %.  (+0.2 pp)

4. Market sentiment (Kalshi 30 %) – signals outsiders are pricing in extra tail risk; I weight it at 25 % relative to my own model, nudging up by +0.8 pp.

Net inside-view probability ≈ 2.37 % + 1 + 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.8 = 4.9 %.

Rounded: 5 %.

Probability calibration

“I expect that about 5 out of 100 times in situations like the present one, Ali Khamenei would cease to be Supreme Leader within the next 39 days.”

Checklist:

1. Paraphrase – “Will Khamenei formally stop being Supreme Leader at any time before 1 Apr 26?”

2. Outside base rate used: 2.37 %.

3. Consistency line written above.

4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):
   • First-ever absence from 8 Feb Air-Force Day ceremony.
   • Khamenei age 86, baseline weekly mortality risk ≈ 0.2 %.
   • Think-tank reports of active succession positioning post-Jun 25 war.
   • Unverified Axios leak of US strike options.
   • Kalshi market implies 30 % odds by 1 Apr.

5. Blind-spot: Sudden verified hospitalisation/death concealed for days then announced in late March; would make my 5 % too low.

6. Status-quo bias check: regime has survived larger crises; formal transition normally follows death, not rumours – supports a low single-digit forecast.

Probability: 5%
