Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (ordered by earliest publication date referenced)

1. BBC “What next for Iran's supreme leader?” (16 Jan 2026).  
   Facts: Describes Khamenei’s bunker residence, continuing protests, and potential successors.  Source quality: high mainstream outlet; quotations from named academics (Azizi, Ansari, Vakil) = credible opinion.  Opinions: regime fragility, likelihood of IRGC rule are assessments, not facts.

2. GB News/MSN (10 Feb 2026).  
   Facts: Khamenei missed annual Air-Force-Day meeting for first time since 1989; Hassan Khomeini stood in.  Source quality: mid-tier tabloid-leaning UK network, but fact (absence) is separately corroborated by Iranian press photos—moderately reliable.  Opinions: “mystery,” “speculation” are colour.

3. Wikipedia “Next Supreme Leader of Iran election” (continuously updated, snapshot Jan 2026).  
   Facts: constitutional process, quoted officials saying “successor chosen.”  Reliability: good for dry constitutional facts; medium for current-events claims (often uncited).

4. NPR interview piece (9 Jul 2025).  
   Facts: Names of frequently mooted successors; expert commentary by Vali Nasr, Afshan Ostovar, Ali Vaez.  High credibility for quoted experts; some speculation.

5. AGSI “Crash of Ayatollah Khamenei's Succession Plans” (mid-2024).  
   Facts: Raisi crash confirmed; outlines formal rules (Art 131).  Analytical opinions on IRGC preferences; quality: specialist think-tank, moderate-to-high.

6. Stimson Center “Khamenei’s Eclipse” (12 Nov 2025).  
   Facts difficult to verify (author anonymous), but institutionally vetted; details on bunker isolation, missed meetings.  Reliability: moderate (single-source, but consistently cited elsewhere).

7. Al-Jazeera war reporting, Jerusalem Post war reporting (Jun 2025).  
   Facts: 12-day war happened, mass casualties.  Quality: mainstream international (AJ) and partisan Israeli (JP).  Health rumours in JP are lower credibility.

8. Agent report (Feb 2026).  
   Synthesises the above; no new primary data.  Useful as structured chronology, but not independent evidence.

(b) Reference class analysis

Candidate reference classes:

1. Natural mortality of very senior male heads of state aged 85–88 over a 40-day horizon.  
2. Non-democratic leaders who exited power within two months during peacetime vs wartime.  
3. Iranian senior clerics’ public-office tenures (tiny N=2; unsuitable).

Chosen class: “Heads of state or de-facto leaders aged 80+ still in power, 1990-2023.”  In this set (~80 leader-years), annual exit (death, coup, resignation) rate ≈ 7 %/yr (rough count: Castro 2006, Mugabe 2017, Hussein 2003, Abd Allah 1999, etc.).  Converting to a 40-day window:  
P(exit) ≈ 1 – (1 – 0.07)^(40/365) ≈ 0.77 %.

(c) Time-frame analysis

• Days until 1 Apr 2026: 39½.  
• Pattern: abrupt exits of elderly autocrats are usually linked either to sudden death (heart attack, stroke, infection) or decisive coups/assassinations—events that cluster around broader crises but remain rare on any given 6-week slice.  
• Historic war periods raise risk slightly (e.g., Saddam 2003; Gaddafi 2011), but only when full-scale regime-change operations are underway.

(d) Justification

Status quo: Khamenei, despite frailty, has retained title through severe shocks (nation-wide protests 2022, Raisi crash 2024, Iran-Israel war 2025).  No credible report yet states he has been deposed or is incapacitated beyond symbolic duties.  Regime elites (IRGC, Assembly of Experts) have incentives to postpone formal transition until death or an orderly conclave; precipitous dismissal would expose them to internal conflict.

Risk factors tilting upward from the raw 0.8 % base:

• Age-specific mortality curve steepens: actuarial tables give an Iranian male aged 86 roughly 8 % chance of dying within a year ⇒ 0.9 % in 40 days (close to reference-class estimate).  
• Documented prostate-cancer metastasis claims and prolonged absences suggest health risk is somewhat above median octogenarian leader.  Adjust upward by ×1.5 → 1.3 %.  
• Security threat: explicit US/Israeli talk of decapitation strikes.  Historically such threats rarely materialise on a six-week schedule (probability maybe 0.2 %).  Add linearly → 1.5 %.  
• Internal coup probability in 40 days judged very low (≈0.1 %) because IRGC hierarchy still appears cohesive.

Outside view (pre-inside-view) therefore lands around 1½ %.

Outside view calibration:

• No single source provides a numeric, so anchoring on actuarial and historical exit rates is appropriate.  
• Upsets (e.g., sudden coups) are low-frequency; even in Arab Spring only ~6 leaders fell over 18 months out of ~20 regimes ⇒ <1 % per 40 days.  
• Given tooling error ±0.5 pp, forecast expressed to nearest tenth of a percent.

Outside View Prediction: 1.5 %
