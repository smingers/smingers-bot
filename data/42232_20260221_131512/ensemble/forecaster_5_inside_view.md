Analysis:  
a) Source analysis (chronological order, key facts vs. opinion, reliability)

1. BBC “What next for Iran’s supreme leader?” (16 Jan 2026) – Main-stream, well-edited. Facts: Khamenei’s reduced public schedule, age 86, names of plausible successors. Opinions: expert assessments of succession jockeying. Reliability: high for facts, moderate for quoted speculation.  
2. Jerusalem Post / ISW note on a new “Defense Council” (17 Feb 2026) – Reputable newspaper quoting think-tank work. Facts: council exists, was set up after June 2025 war. Opinion: “real sign of a break.” Reliability: medium-high.  
3. Gulf News, GB News, The Sun, WION pieces (9-10 Feb 2026) – All agree on one verifiable fact: Khamenei skipped the 8 Feb Air-Force Day meeting for the first time since 1989. Everything else (tunnel rumours, son running daily ops) is unattributed rumour. Reliability: high for the single absence fact, low for the rest.  
4. Axios-echo stories in Russian-language outlets (21 Feb 2026) – All trace back to a single Axios leak that “unnamed US officials” presented Trump with an assassination option. No confirmation from US government; wording is clearly contingency planning. Reliability: moderate at best; likelihood of leak being true >0, but implementation probability unknown.  
5. Valor Econômico, Economic Times, News18 (20-21 Feb 2026) – Long backgrounders, mostly synthesis. Little new factual content, helpful for overall pressure landscape. Reliability: good for context, weak for novel claims.  
6. Benzinga (19 Feb 2026) – Lists Kalshi prediction-market prices. Those are directly verifiable numbers; useful as the only market signal. Reliability: high for contract prices.

b) Evidence analysis (strength tagged)

Strong:  
• Confirmed first-ever absence from the 8 Feb annual Air-Force ceremony (four independent outlets, identical detail).  
• Age 86 actuarial mortality (~13 %/yr).  
• Pre-existing Iranian constitutional rule: only death, deposition, or incapacitation ends tenure.

Moderate:  
• Formation of an emergency “Defense Council” independent of the Supreme Leader (ISW/J-Post) → indicates elite hedging for transition.  
• Axios leak that a US strike on Khamenei is on the table. Planning is real; execution uncertain.  
• Elevated Kalshi odds (30 % by Apr 1) – market participants believe risk is higher than baseline, but volume still modest.

Weak:  
• Rumours that Khamenei “fled to tunnels”, “hands power to son” – repeated but unsourced.  
• Speculation that his absence was illness rather than security.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Window left: 39 days. If the window were halved to 20 days I would trim the probability by ≈25 % (many coup/strike scenarios would still need days of trigger). If doubled to 80 days I would raise the probability to roughly 8 %, mainly from actuarial death risk scaling linearly.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (autocrat death/exit over 39 days) = 2.1 %.  

Adjustments upward:  
+1.4  ppt Observed frailty signal: unprecedented missed ceremony suggests either poor health or acute security risk. (Moderate evidence.)  
+0.7  ppt External hazard: U.S. contingency planning + regional military build-up makes a strike non-negligible. (Moderate evidence.)  
+0.5  ppt Elite manoeuvring (Defense Council) marginally raises chance of an internally driven transfer if Khamenei is incapacitated. (Weak-to-moderate.)  

Adjustments downward / status-quo stickiness:  
-0.1  ppt Regime’s proven ability to mask leader’s condition for weeks could delay any official “cessation” beyond 1 April.  

Net inside-view estimate ≈ 2.1 + 1.4 + 0.7 + 0.5 – 0.1 = 4.6 %. I round to the nearest whole percent for practicality → 5 %.

Probability calibration  
“About five times in a hundred comparable situations, a credible report would declare that Ali Khamenei ceased to be Supreme Leader before 1 Apr 2026.”

Checklist:  
1. Re-phrased question: Will credible sources state that Khamenei is no longer Supreme Leader at any time up to 00:01 UTC 1 Apr 2026?  
2. Outside view base: 2.1 %.  
3. Consistency: “5 of 100” line above – passes sanity check.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • First-ever absence from 8 Feb Air-Force ceremony.  
   • Age 86 mortality rate.  
   • Axios leak of U.S. assassination option.  
   • Elite “Defense Council” hedging for succession.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden heart attack on 30 Mar with regime announcing death on 3 Apr (after window) – would make me under-estimate.  
6. Status-quo inertia: IRGC security and information control favour “no change”; hence final probability remains low.

Probability: 5%
