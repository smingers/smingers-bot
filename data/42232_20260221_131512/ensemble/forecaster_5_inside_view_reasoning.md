**Assessing the situation**

I need to create a professional superforecaster analysis. We have a baseline for the outside view at around 2.1%. With April 1, 2026, coming up in 39 days, I need to factor in new internal information. Khamenei is likely 86 or 87, having missed a key military event, possibly indicating health concerns. Rumors suggest he may be in hiding, delegating authority to his son. US tensions are rising, with reports of a potential strike. I must weigh these factors and assess evidence reliability, particularly referencing unnamed officials.**Analyzing probabilities for Khamenei's future**

I'm examining the situation surrounding potential changes after Khamenei. There are protests and factions preparing for a post-Khamenei era, suggesting an expectation of his eventual death, possibly in months rather than days. Given his age of 86, the mortality probability in 39 days is around 1.4%. I've calculated risks from various factors: natural death could double this to 2.8%, while a coup might be around 0.4%, and the chance of an external assassination could be about 1%. Overall, I’m leaning towards a final adjusted probability of 5%. I'll include all relevant sections in the final analysis.
