This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) report that Ali Khamenei has ceased to be the Supreme Leader of Iran for any reason.

Additional fine-print:
To qualify, Khamenei must either formally cease to be the Supreme Leader or be deposed, including fleeing the country or being held captive by an opposing group. Withdrawal from duties, for example due to health issues, is not sufficient.

Fleeing the country is defined as an indefinite departure from Iran and would also count for a Yes resolution. For example, reports that Khamenei has travelled to another country for medical treatment or a state visit would be considered temporary and would be insufficient. However, a departure in the context of a regime change in Tehran would be considered indefinite and would resolve as Yes. To assess the truth of the matter, Metaculus will consult credible source reporting. As an example, a hypothetical question on Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's [departure from Iran](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/january-16/shah-flees-iran) in 1979 would have resolved as Yes due to the preponderance of reporting, even though Pahlavi did not relinquish his title as Shah.

## Summary: "Shah Flees Iran | January 16, 1979 | HISTORY"

**Source:** History.com | **Date:** July 21, 2010

---

### Core Event
On January 16, 1979, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi — Iran's leader since 1941 — was forced to flee Iran amid an army mutiny and violent anti-government demonstrations. Fourteen days later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from 15 years of exile and took control of Iran.

---

### Key Historical Context
- **1941:** British and Soviet occupation of Iran led to the first Pahlavi shah abdicating in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza.
- **1953:** After being briefly ousted due to Premier Mosaddeq's popularity, the shah was restored to sole power via a British-U.S. intelligence coup.
- **1963:** The shah launched the "White Revolution" — land reform, infrastructure development, women's voting rights, and literacy programs — which drew criticism from Islamic leaders who saw it as westernization.
- **1964:** Khomeini was exiled to Iraq, from where he continued inciting opposition via radio broadcasts.

### Factors Leading to the Shah's Fall
- Growing religious discontent and the shah's increasingly repressive response, including use of a brutal secret police
- Economic grievances among poor and middle classes who felt excluded from White Revolution benefits
- **September 8, 1978:** Security forces killed hundreds of demonstrators
- **December 11, 1978:** A soldier mutiny attacked the shah's security officers, effectively collapsing his regime

### Aftermath
- The shah traveled through multiple countries before entering the **United States in October 1979** for cancer treatment
- In response, Islamic militants stormed the U.S. embassy on **November 4, 1979**, taking 52 hostages for **444 days**, demanding the shah's return to stand trial
- **Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi died in Egypt in July 1980**

---

### Relevance to Forecasting Question
This article is cited in the question's fine print as a **precedent example**: Metaculus notes that a hypothetical question about the Shah's 1979 departure would have resolved **Yes** based on the preponderance of reporting, even though Pahlavi never formally relinquished his title as Shah. This establishes the interpretive framework for assessing whether Khamenei has "ceased to be Supreme Leader."

<QuestionSource url="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ygl4lpl1o">
## Summary: "What Now for Iran's Supreme Leader?" (BBC, January 16, 2026)

### Khamenei's Current Situation
- Khamenei is reportedly hiding in a **secret bunker/hideout**, described as a "marked man" who will not be appearing publicly anytime soon.
- Trump has referenced the fates of **Qassem Soleimani** (killed by US drone strike), **Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi** (killed in US raid), and **Hassan Nasrallah** (killed in Israeli airstrike underground) when discussing options regarding Khamenei — implying potential targeted action.
- The **recent US kidnapping of Venezuelan President Maduro** in a commando raid is also noted as likely weighing on Khamenei's mind.

### Protests and Regime Stability
- **Ongoing protests** in Iran have been driven primarily by **economic grievances** — currency collapse, poverty, shortages of water, electricity, and gas — rather than solely political/religious issues as in 2022.
- Security forces have **massacred thousands of protesters**, including in villages, with internet shutdowns limiting full visibility of casualties.
- Despite the unrest, **no significant dissent or disloyalty** has been detected within the Revolutionary Guard.
- Trump has encouraged protesters to "occupy government buildings," stating "Help is on its way."

### Potential Successors/Power Vacuum
Several figures are discussed as potential successors if Khamenei is removed:

- **Revolutionary Guard / Military Rule**: Most likely immediate outcome, with parliament speaker **Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf** (64, ex-IRGC) cited as a possible figure, though Khamenei never fully trusted him.
- **Hassan Rouhani** (former moderate president): Positioning himself for reformist/moderate Islamist support.
- **Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi** (65, in exile in Washington): Popular in street protests, but lacks organizational base inside Iran and is considered a **divisive figure** who has failed to unite the opposition abroad.

### Expert Opinions
- **Arash Azizi (Yale University)**: Says a "significant section of the ruling elite" may *welcome* Khamenei's removal as an opportunity to change core policies, and might even welcome US attacks to accelerate that process.
- **Ali Ansari (University of St Andrews)**: Argues reformists are "largely irrelevant" and "completely marginalised" — the divide is simply between "rulers and the ruled." Also notes Iran's infrastructure problems are deeply structural, stemming from lack of investment 20 years ago.
- **Dr. Sanam Vakil (Chatham House)**: States the protests are about "completely transforming Iranian governance" away from the existing system of nearly five decades — suggesting no easy accommodation is possible.

### Khamenei's Outlook
- Khamenei has **acknowledged traders' economic grievances** but blamed "enemies" for the problems.
- He is assessed as likely to **"plough on with an iron fist,"** believing his rule is divinely sanctioned.
- The article notes that even if current protests subside, Iranians have historically returned to protest repeatedly (2009, 2019, 2022, and now).

## Summary: Next Supreme Leader of Iran Election (Wikipedia Article)

### Current Status of Succession Planning
- As of January 2026, **no official heir or nominee** has been publicly declared to succeed Khamenei
- The **Assembly of Experts** is constitutionally responsible for selecting the next Supreme Leader
- A **four-member council** within the Assembly has been secretly examining candidates and advising Khamenei; one member stated a successor has already been chosen but declined to reveal the identity for safety reasons
- Khamenei himself has not publicly discussed his replacement

### Reported Instability Around Khamenei's Role (2025)
- During the **2025 Iran-Israel war**, unverified Western and opposition sources claimed Khamenei suffered a mental breakdown and was allegedly **removed from key decisions** by military commanders
- **Majlis speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf** was reportedly replacing Khamenei in war decisions, though Khamenei himself claimed personal control
- **Ali Larijani** (newly appointed head of Supreme National Security Council) reportedly took on Khamenei's responsibilities when he was unreachable
- According to *The National Interest*, an **IRGC military junta** had already effectively replaced Khamenei
- Post-war, Khamenei **rarely made public appearances**

### Post-2026 Protest Context
- U.S. President Trump called Khamenei a "sick man" and called for new Iranian leadership
- The Iranian government threatened to declare **Islamic Jihad against the West** in the event of Khamenei's death

### Constitutional Succession Process
- Upon the Supreme Leader's death or dismissal, the Assembly of Experts must **immediately convene** to appoint a successor
- A **Provisional Leadership Council** (comprising the President, Chief Justice, and a Guardian Council cleric) serves in an interim capacity until a permanent successor is chosen

### Key Potential Successors Identified
- **Mojtaba Khamenei** (son) – increasingly discussed, reportedly chosen by his father per Israeli sources (denied by pro-government media); his appointment could cause internal conflict
- **Sadiq Larijani, Mohammad Mirbagheri, Mohsen Araki** – close aides to Khamenei
- **Hassan Khomeini** – grandson of the Islamic Republic's founder; considered unlikely due to political marginalization
- **Ebrahim Raisi** – was a frontrunner before his death in May 2024

### Notable Pre-War Development
- Shortly **before the Twelve-Day War**, Khamenei reportedly requested the Assembly of Experts to **prepare for successor selection**
- Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, *The New York Times* reported Khamenei had designated **three senior clerics** as potential successors in case of assassination

<Summary source="https://agsi.org/analysis/crash-of-ayatollah-khameneis-succession-plans/">
## Summary: "Crash of Ayatollah Khamenei's Succession Plans" (AGSI)

### Context
The article analyzes the political fallout from the May 19 helicopter crash that killed Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, focusing on its impact on Iran's domestic politics, succession dynamics, and foreign policy posture.

### Key Facts & Constitutional Mechanics
- Article 131 of Iran's Constitution stipulates that upon a president's death, the vice president (Mohammad Mokhber) assumes presidential powers with the supreme leader's approval
- A council of the vice president, parliamentary speaker (Qalibaf), and judiciary chief (Mohseni Ejei) must organize new elections within 50 days
- State media broadcast footage of Mokhber presiding over Cabinet meetings, indicating constitutional procedures were being followed

### Succession Dynamics & Potential Candidates
- Raisi had been considered a likely successor to Khamenei as Supreme Leader; his death disrupted those plans
- **Potential presidential candidates** identified: Qalibaf, Ali Larijani, Ahmadinejad, Rouhani
- **Potential Supreme Leader successors** mentioned: Hassan Khomeini (grandson of the Islamic Republic's founder) and Mojtaba Khamenei (Khamenei's son, though dynastic concerns complicate this)
- The IRGC is described as preferring a **weak, compliant successor** — "a puppet rather than a strong leader"

### Key Analytical Opinions (Named Sources)
- **Khamenei** publicly urged calm, stating there would be "no disruption in the work of government"
- **London-based Amwaj Media** (described as having near-exclusive access to Islamic Republic officials) suggested the crash could be an opportunity for Khamenei to "upend Iranian politics" and encourage competitive elections with high turnout

### Foreign & Security Policy Assessment
- The article's author argues there is **"little prospect for significant change"** in Iran's foreign and security policy regardless of presidential or supreme leader succession
- Iran's core strategic goals — nuclear deterrence, proxy cultivation, regime survival — are described as institutionally embedded and unlikely to shift with new leadership
- The regime is assessed as capable of continuing to suppress protests, deter invasion, and protect nuclear infrastructure **if** elite cohesion and IRGC loyalty are maintained

### Broader Context Note
The article briefly references other AGSI analyses suggesting Iran faces a "slow collapse" without a U.S. deal, and notes increasing pressure from protesters and armed insurgent groups — though the regime is described as "not yet doomed."

## Summary: NPR Article on Khamenei's Potential Successors (July 9, 2025)

### Context
Following a **12-day war between Israel and Iran in June 2025**, questions about succession for 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei have intensified. Israel bombed key Iranian nuclear sites during the conflict, and Khamenei was reportedly a potential Israeli target.

### Expert Opinions on Succession Process

- **Vali Nasr (Johns Hopkins/Iran expert):** Says succession planning has been underway for 4-5 years, but the recent war made it more urgent. Khamenei has reportedly given names of potential successors to the Assembly of Experts and created "contingency plans" for a smoother transfer of power.

- **Afshan Ostovar (Naval Postgraduate School):** Says Khamenei is deliberately withholding his preferred successor's identity to protect that person from political attacks. Argues the successor **must be a cleric**, otherwise "you no longer have an Islamic Republic."

- **Ali Vaez (International Crisis Group):** Offers a more dramatic assessment — suggests **Khamenei may be the last supreme leader of Iran**. Notes Iran's severe setbacks: battered economy, social discontent, loss of regional proxies (e.g., Hezbollah), and military decimation. Argues the **IRGC may no longer view the clerical establishment as an asset**.

### Potential Successors Mentioned
- **Mojtaba Khamenei** (Khamenei's son, age 55, hardliner)
- **Hassan Khomeini** (grandson of Ayatollah Khomeini, age 52)
- **Hassan Rouhani** and **Mohammad Khatami** (reform-minded former presidents)

### Nature of Future Leadership
- Nasr notes the IRGC already effectively runs the country — controlling government, media, economy, and decision-making — operating "behind a civilian facade."
- Power brokers reportedly favor a **weaker successor** they can influence, rather than another potential autocrat.
- There are growing voices favoring **de-escalation with the West**, though not outright alliance.

### Key Contingency: How Khamenei Dies Matters
- **Natural death** → more likely a moderate successor
- **Assassination** → more likely a hardline cleric takes control to maintain continuity

### Khamenei's Health and Absence
- Khamenei, 86, has experienced escalating health crises since a 2014 prostate cancer surgery, with reports of **advanced cognitive impairment and coma-like episodes**
- Following Israeli strikes during a "12-day war" in June 2025 that killed IRGC commander Hossein Salami, chief of general staff Mohammad Bagheri, and dozens of nuclear scientists, Khamenei **retreated to a hardened Tehran bunker** and communicated only through a single aide (Ali Asghar Hejazi) for nine days
- During this period, **no one — including President Pezeshkian or the Supreme National Security Council — could reach him directly**
- Parliament Speaker Ghalibaf **unilaterally assumed emergency military authority** without constitutional basis; IRGC regional commanders launched uncoordinated missile strikes
- Khamenei approved a US-proposed ceasefire via a **45-second pre-recorded video on June 26**
- Post-war public appearances have been sparse: a "silent wave" at the July 5 Ashura commemoration, skipping Quds Day, Eid al-Ghadir, and Police Week; first confirmed post-war public sighting was **October 20**, with another appearance on **November 4**
- State media has relied on **archival footage, pre-recorded clips, and inconsistently timestamped photos** to mask his absence

---

### Governance Paralysis
- Nuclear talks have stalled under renewed U.S. and UN maximum pressure
- Key economic reform proposals (subsidy reform, rial stabilization, FATF compliance) remain **unsigned on Khamenei's desk**
- **Inflation reached 49% in September 2025**; the rial fell below **1,000,000 to the dollar**
- Water shortages led to rotational cutoffs in Tehran, with rationing warnings for fall
- **$35 billion diverted** from the National Development Fund to IRGC projects without apparent oversight
- The Supreme Council of Cyberspace has **not met since May 2025**

---

### Factional Infighting
- Without Khamenei's mediating hand, factional rivalry has become "raw, unchecked partisan warfare"
- Hardliners have impeached moderate ministers (e.g., Economy Minister Abdolnaser Hemati); the IRGC has accused reformists of treason; parliament has devolved into "mutual denunciations"
- Post-war recriminations: conservatives blame the government for accepting the ceasefire; pragmatists blame hardline provocations for inviting attack

---

### Succession Scenarios
- **No obvious kingmaker** exists comparable to Rafsanjani, who orchestrated Khamenei's own rise in 1989
- Iran is described as "a nest of rival fiefdoms" — IRGC economic cartels, intelligence barons, clerical mafias, and bureaucratic warlords
- Three scenarios outlined:
  1. **IRGC dominance**: IRGC pressures the Assembly of Experts to install their preferred candidate, entrenching repression and IRGC economic power
  2. **Collective leadership**: Temporary arrangement involving the president, Expediency Council head, and a Guardian Council cleric — likely to produce deadlock with the IRGC as ultimate arbiter
  3. **Optimistic/civil society scenario**: Peaceful protests pressure hardliners toward a constitutional referendum dismantling the theocracy — described as difficult to envision at present

Query: Provide a detailed chronology of credible reports from 2020-Feb 21 2026 on Ali Khamenei’s health issues, public absences, or succession preparations, including dates, missed events, official statements, and potential successors.
# Chronology of Ali Khamenei's Health Issues, Public Absences, and Succession Preparations (2020–February 2026)

## Background: Pre-2020 Health History

Khamenei's health concerns predate the 2020–2026 window but provide essential context:
- **September 2014**: Khamenei underwent prostate surgery at a Tehran government hospital, described officially as "routine" and successful (BBC, September 8, 2014). This was unprecedented in its transparency.
- **March 2015**: Arabic and French media (Le Figaro, citing Western intelligence) reported Khamenei had stage-four prostate cancer that had spread, with doctors giving him "at most two years to live." These reports were unconfirmed by Iranian authorities (Times of Israel, March 5, 2015; World Jewish Congress, February 17, 2026 reprint of 2015 reporting).
- **January 2007**: A rumor of his death spread after he missed public ceremonies due to flu, establishing a pattern of speculation during absences.

---

## 2020–2021: COVID-Era Reduced Visibility

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Khamenei adopted mask-wearing and reduced in-person public appearances, making it difficult to distinguish health-related absences from pandemic precautions. The NCRI (December 14, 2021) noted Khamenei held a meeting with nurses that was characterized as propaganda, suggesting he remained publicly active in a limited capacity. No major health crisis was specifically documented in 2020–2021 beyond pandemic-related caution.

---

## September 2022: "Gravely Ill" Reports and Public Reappearance

- **Mid-September 2022**: Multiple unconfirmed reports emerged that Khamenei, then 83, had fallen "gravely ill." The New York Times, citing four unnamed sources, reported he experienced severe stomach pains, underwent surgery for bowel obstruction, was too weak to sit up, and had cancelled all public meetings.
- Iranian state media and the government remained silent on these reports. The only local denial was that Khamenei had not cancelled a meeting with the Assembly of Experts.
- **September 17, 2022**: Khamenei made a public appearance at an Arbaeen mourning ceremony, walking, waving to crowds, and sitting to observe the event. Al Jazeera reported this as his first public appearance after the health reports, effectively countering the most alarming claims (Al Jazeera, September 17, 2022).
- This episode reinforced a recurring pattern: alarming Western/opposition reports followed by Iranian state media counter-narratives and eventual public appearances.

---

## 2023–2024: Raisi's Death and Succession Speculation Intensifies

- **May 2024**: President Ebrahim Raisi, widely considered a leading contender to succeed Khamenei as Supreme Leader, died in a helicopter crash. This dramatically altered succession dynamics, removing the most prominent heir apparent.
- Raisi's death reopened succession questions. Mojtaba Khamenei (born 1969), the Supreme Leader's second son, became more prominently discussed as a possible successor, though analysts noted his insufficient theological standing and the political problems of dynastic succession (Wikipedia on Mojtaba Khamenei).

---

## June 2025: Iran-Israel War — Bunker Isolation and Succession Nominations

The most dramatic and consequential period for Khamenei's public presence and succession planning came during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June 2025:

- **June 13, 2025**: Israel launched military operations against Iran, killing IRGC commander Hossein Salami, chief of general staff Mohammad Bagheri, and dozens of nuclear scientists in opening strikes.
- Khamenei retreated to a hardened underground bunker, reportedly in Lavizan, northeast Tehran (Iran International). He communicated exclusively through a single trusted aide, Ali Asghar Hejazi, for nine critical days. No one — including President Masoud Pezeshkian or the Supreme National Security Council — could reach him directly.
- Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf unilaterally assumed emergency military authority for several days without constitutional basis. IRGC regional commanders launched uncoordinated missile salvos.
- **June 21, 2025**: The New York Times reported, citing three Iranian officials, that Khamenei had nominated **three senior clerics as potential successors** — a highly unusual move. Notably, his son **Mojtaba Khamenei was not among the three nominees**, signaling a deliberate rejection of dynastic succession (Times of Israel, June 21, 2025).
- Khamenei also named "an array of replacements down his chain of military command."
- **June 26, 2025**: Khamenei approved a US-proposed ceasefire via a **45-second pre-recorded video** — his primary mode of communication during the crisis.
- **July 5, 2025**: Khamenei made only a "silent wave" at the Ashura commemoration, normally the high point of the Shia Islamic calendar.
- He subsequently **skipped** other annual rituals including Quds Day, Eid al-Ghadir, and Police Week.

---

## July–November 2025: Prolonged Absence and Governance Paralysis

The Stimson Center (November 12, 2025), citing a Tehran-based analyst, provided the most comprehensive account of Khamenei's post-war condition:

- Reports described "advanced cognitive impairment and even coma-like episodes" in addition to ongoing health crises since his 2014 prostate surgery.
- State media resorted to **archival footage, pre-recorded clips, and inconsistently timestamped photos** to mask his absence.
- **October 20, 2025**: Described as his "first post-war public sighting."
- **November 4, 2025**: He appeared to commemorate the 1979 US Embassy hostage-taking anniversary.
- Iran International (July 10, 2025) reported speculation about whether Khamenei would seek revenge against officials who had made power bids during his absence.
- Times of India (July 14, 2025) reported Khamenei had named three successors and was operating from a bunker, with Mojtaba's exclusion confirmed.
- The Stimson Center analysis described Iran as experiencing "unprecedented factional fighting and decision-making paralysis," with nuclear talks stalled, economic indicators deteriorating (inflation at 49% in September 2025, rial below 1,000,000 to the dollar), and key government bodies non-functional.

---

## February 2026: Missed Military Meeting and Renewed Health Speculation

- **February 8, 2026**: Khamenei **missed the annual meeting with Air Force commanders** — an event he had attended every year since becoming Supreme Leader in 1989 (37 consecutive years). Armed forces chief of staff Abdolrahim Mousavi met senior air force officers in his place. GB News/MSN reported Hassan Khomeini (grandson of the Islamic Republic's founder) replaced him at the event. No official explanation was given (Firstpost, February 9, 2026; GB News via MSN, February 10, 2026).
- This absence triggered significant speculation given the unbroken 37-year streak and the heightened geopolitical context (ongoing US-Iran nuclear tensions, potential US military strike discussions).
- **February 17, 2026**: The World Jewish Congress republished/referenced reporting that Khamenei was "reportedly in serious condition at a hospital in Tehran," suffering from prostate cancer that had "spread to the rest of his body." This echoed 2015 reporting but was presented as current.
- **February 18–20, 2026**: US-Iran tensions remained extremely high, with sources telling Axios there was a "90 percent chance" of US kinetic action against Iran within weeks (Times of Israel, February 18, 2026). Iran and the US held nuclear talks in Geneva, with Iran claiming agreement on "guiding principles."

## Succession Landscape as of February 2026

**Confirmed eliminated candidates:**
- **Ebrahim Raisi** — died in helicopter crash, May 2024
- **Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi** — died December 2018
- **Mojtaba Khamenei** — reportedly excluded from Khamenei's own succession list (June 2025)

**Remaining discussed candidates:**
- **Three unnamed senior clerics** nominated by Khamenei in June 2025 (identities not publicly disclosed)
- **Sadeq Larijani** — head of Expediency Council, conservative, US/EU-sanctioned for human rights violations
- The IRGC is expected to dominate the succession process, potentially pressuring the Assembly of Experts

**Structural challenges:** The Stimson Center noted there is "no obvious kingmaker" comparable to Rafsanjani in 1989, and Iran's political landscape has fragmented into "rival fiefdoms including IRGC economic cartels, intelligence barons, clerical mafias, and bureaucratic warlords."

## Assessment for Forecasting Purposes

As of late February 2026, Khamenei remains Supreme Leader but shows multiple indicators of severely diminished capacity: a 37-year streak broken at the February 8 military meeting, prolonged post-war absences in mid-2025, reliance on pre-recorded communications, reports of cognitive decline, and active succession nomination. The combination of his age (86), reported advanced prostate cancer, post-war isolation, and the unprecedented missed military meeting represent the most credible cluster of signals yet. However, Iranian authorities have consistently denied or ignored health reports, and Khamenei has made periodic public appearances (October 20, November 4, 2025) that complicate definitive assessments. The question of whether he will formally cease to be Supreme Leader before April 1, 2026 remains genuinely uncertain, with no confirmed incapacitation or succession process formally initiated as of the available evidence.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
