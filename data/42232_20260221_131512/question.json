    "description": "GB News via MSN February 10, 2026: [Mystery as Iran's Ayatollah goes missing from key military meeting - with no reason why](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/mystery-as-iran-s-ayatollah-goes-missing-from-key-military-meeting-with-no-reason-why/ar-AA1W1uFT)\n\n> Iran's Supreme Leader was mysteriously absent from a key military meeting this weekend - with no reason given as to why.\n\n> Mr Khamenei has attended the event every year since becoming Supreme Leader in 1989.\n\n> This year however, he was replaced by Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of Ruhollah Khomeini.\n\n> No official explanation was given for his absence, triggering speculation amid heightened tension in the region.\n\n> Previous reports claimed Ayatollah Khameini had fled to a heavily fortified shelter linked by a maze of tunnels under Tehran as protests rocked the nation.\n\nSee also from the BBC: [What next for Iran's supreme leader?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ygl4lpl1o)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":42148,\"question_id\":41927}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) report that Ali Khamenei has ceased to be the Supreme Leader of Iran for any reason.",
    "fine_print": "To qualify, Khamenei must either formally cease to be the Supreme Leader or be deposed, including fleeing the country or being held captive by an opposing group. Withdrawal from duties, for example due to health issues, is not sufficient.\n\nFleeing the country is defined as an indefinite departure from Iran and would also count for a Yes resolution. For example, reports that Khamenei has travelled to another country for medical treatment or a state visit would be considered temporary and would be insufficient. However, a departure in the context of a regime change in Tehran would be considered indefinite and would resolve as Yes. To assess the truth of the matter, Metaculus will consult credible source reporting. As an example, a hypothetical question on Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's [departure from Iran](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/january-16/shah-flees-iran) in 1979 would have resolved as Yes due to the preponderance of reporting, even though Pahlavi did not relinquish his title as Shah.\n\n***\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/42148) which opened on 2026-02-17 12:00:00. This question will resolve based on the resolution criteria and fine print contained above. However, if this question would resolve differently than the original question, then this question will be annulled. Additionally, if the original question's resolution could have been known before this question opened, then this question will be annulled.",
