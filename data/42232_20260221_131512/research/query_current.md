Analysis:
We need to assess whether Ali Khamenei is likely to leave the post of Supreme Leader before 1 April 2026. The most telling news right now would concern 1) his unexplained absence from recent ceremonies, 2) credible health or death rumors, 3) reports of hospitalization or evacuation, and 4) discussions of succession procedures or contenders (e.g., Mojtaba Khamenei, Hassan Khomeini, Assembly of Experts activity). Therefore, searches should focus on late-February 2026 coverage of Khamenei’s health, whereabouts, and possible power transition.
