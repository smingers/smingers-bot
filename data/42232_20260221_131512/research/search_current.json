Quoted: *\"If the regime is going to fail, they will go for personal protection.\"*\n\n- **Annika Ganzeveld** (Middle East Portfolio Manager, Critical Threats Project, American Enterprise Institute): Argued the moves are **less about regime change and more about preparing for Khamenei's inevitable death**. States that since the June war, senior members have been **\"vying for influence\"** to secure positions under future leadership.\n\n---\n\n### Ghalibaf's Rising Profile\n- Given a **more senior role in war efforts** after the June conflict, following the deaths of many top regime officials in Israeli strikes.\n- Tehran's elite reportedly suspected Khamenei would **elevate Ghalibaf** to a more senior regime role (per a November Iran International report).\n- Earlier in February 2026, Ghalibaf **led \"Death to America! Death to Israel!\" chants** in parliament while wearing an IRGC uniform, signaling a more assertive public posture.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Framing\nThe article presents a picture of **internal regime maneuvering in anticipation of Khamenei's death**, rather than an imminent or forced removal. Analysts frame this as survivalist positioning by Iran's elite, not necessarily a sign of imminent collapse.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://english.aawsat.com/features/5242999-iran%E2%80%99s-khamenei-faces-gravest-crisis-his-rule-us-strike-force-gathers\">\n## Summary of Article on Ali Khamenei's Position and Challenges\n\n*Note: The article appears to combine two separate pieces \u2014 one on Khamenei and one on Ukrainian refugees in Poland.

Despite a history of resilience, Khamenei now confronts declining regional influence as allies like Hezbollah and Bashar al-Assad have weakened. The U.S. demands Iran abandon its ballistic missile arsenal\u2014the last strategic instrument remaining\u2014yet Khamenei refuses to negotiate on this issue, viewing it as essential for deterrence against Israel. His rigid stance risks triggering further U.S. airstrikes, especially as American military mobilization intensifies. Khamenei maintains absolute control over Iran\u2019s theocratic system, with no institutional checks on his authority. Though initially seen as weak and lacking religious credentials, he consolidated power through a loyal security apparatus, including the Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) and Basij paramilitary forces, which have suppressed dissent since 2009 and 2022. His financial empire, Setad, worth tens of billions, funds his regime\u2019s security structures. Despite ideological rigidity, Khamenei has shown tactical flexibility\u2014evidenced by his cautious support for the 2015 nuclear deal\u2014when regime survival is at stake. He blames U.S. President Donald Trump for unrest, calling him a 'criminal' for harming Iran. Analysts, including Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment, describe him as a historically unexpected yet profoundly powerful figure who transformed from a weak president into one of Iran\u2019s most influential leaders in a century.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 21, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource:[Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2026/02/21/inimigo-implacavel-dos-eua-khamenei-enfrenta-o-mais-grave-desafio-ao-regime-no-ira.ghtml)\n\n**Axios: Trump Considers Elimination of Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei and His Son**\nAccording to Axios, citing unnamed U.S. officials, former U.S. President Donald Trump is considering military action against Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his son, with potential strikes planned for the weekend of February 21\u201322, 2026.

Officials note that the threshold for a future nuclear deal with Iran is extremely high, as it must convince skeptical figures within Trump\u2019s administration and in the region. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, announced that Iran would present a final proposal within days, but U.S. and Israeli sources suggest Trump may proceed with strikes regardless.

The U.S. is reportedly willing to accept a 'symbolic' uranium enrichment deal with Iran if it prevents Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, signaling a possible gap between U.S. red lines and Iran\u2019s position. However, the administration is also preparing for more radical options, including a strike that would eliminate Khamenei, his son, and other senior clerics. U.S. officials emphasize that the bar for any nuclear deal is high, requiring a proposal that can politically satisfy Trump and regional allies. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced a final offer from Iran within days of February 20, 2026, but U.S. and Israeli sources suggest Trump may act before then.

Despite his frail appearance, his rhetoric remains uncompromising, positioning himself as the 'master of martyrs' amid a standoff with the US under President Donald Trump. In a February 17 speech in Tehran, Khamenei dismissed the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford and other American military assets in the Persian Gulf as failed intimidation, invoking Imam Hussein to warn that a warship is less dangerous than the weapon capable of sinking it. This apocalyptic tone serves to bolster domestic loyalty and set rigid boundaries for ongoing indirect nuclear negotiations in Geneva. While Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi discusses 'guiding principles' for a potential deal, Khamenei has publicly ruled out abandoning uranium enrichment or limiting ballistic missile development, viewing the nuclear program as a strategic insurance policy. Reports indicate he has approved the design of compact nuclear warheads, signaling a shift from his long-standing fatwa against weapons of mass destruction, as the perceived threat from the US or Israel has intensified. Domestically, Khamenei maintains control through the militarized Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), suppressing the 'January Sedition' \u2014 a wave of protests driven by economic collapse and repression \u2014 with extreme violence, killing thousands and detaining tens of thousands. He labeled the protests a 'foreign-backed coup', equating dissent with national survival and eliminating moderate political alternatives. As regional tensions escalate toward what Khamenei calls a 'regional war', his legacy hinges on whether he pursues 'heroic flexibility' akin to the 2015 nuclear deal or prepares for a final, defiant stand. His core calculation remains: the cost of surrender is higher than the risk of conflict. In the volatile context of 2026 West Asia, his next move will determine whether the Islamic Republic survives its greatest storm or collapses under the pressure it has spent decades resisting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 11:22 AM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/explainers/armadas-and-apocalypses-khameneis-guide-to-revolutionary-brinkmanship-9920148.html)\n\n**Iranian supreme leader Khamenei, implacable foe of the US**\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader since 1989, faces his most severe crisis in 36 years amid escalating foreign pressure, regional setbacks, and domestic unrest. Despite surviving past crackdowns and sanctions, Khamenei now confronts a deteriorating strategic position: Israel and the U.S. have weakened Iran's regional proxies, including Hezbollah and Syria's Assad regime, while U.S. threats of airstrikes loom after strikes killed close allies in June 2023. In January 2024, he ordered the deadliest suppression of protests since the 1979 Revolution, resulting in thousands of deaths, after demonstrators chanted 'Death to the dictator!'. Iran has offered limited concessions on its nuclear program\u2014seen by the West as a path to atomic weapons\u2014but refuses to discuss giving up its ballistic missile arsenal, which it views as essential for deterrence against Israel. Khamenei's power is rooted in a loyal security apparatus, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Basij paramilitary force, which have crushed multiple uprisings. His authority is further consolidated through Setad, a vast parastatal financial empire under his direct control, worth tens of billions of dollars. Though initially seen as weak and lacking clerical stature, Khamenei rose to power by building a security network and employing 'heroic flexibility'\u2014a strategy of tactical compromise when the survival of the Islamic Republic is at stake, such as his cautious support for the 2015 nuclear deal. His worldview is shaped by deep distrust of the U.S., trauma from past imprisonment and assassination attempts, and a history of war with Iraq. According to Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment, Khamenei's rise was an 'accident of history' that transformed a weak figure into one of the most powerful men in Iran's modern era.

According to data from Kalshi, a federally authorized betting platform, over $21.8 million has been wagered on the contract 'Ali Khamenei out as Supreme Leader?' The probability of Khamenei being removed before September 1, 2026, increased to 48%, up 12 percentage points. Shorter timelines show higher confidence: 42% probability by July 1, 2026, and 30% by April 1, 2026. These increases follow U.S. threats under former President Donald Trump, Iran's live-fire drills that temporarily closed the Strait of Hormuz, and internal unrest, including protests where activists claim over 7,000 people were killed, according to an AP report. On another Kalshi contract predicting which world leader will be removed by 2027, Khamenei\u2019s odds rose to 63%, up 9 percentage points.

Khamenei emphasized that the U.S. 'arrogant nature' demands submission, and that only when the U.S. recognizes the cost of confrontation with a strong Iran will Tehran achieve 'immunity.' This stance follows a 12-day conflict in June 2025 between Iran and Israel, triggered by Israel's unprecedented bombing campaign and Iran's retaliatory missile and drone strikes, which disrupted nuclear talks that had begun in April. A ceasefire has been in place since June 24, 2025. Iran remains under severe international sanctions, including renewed UN sanctions under the 'snapback' mechanism in September 2025, initiated by Britain, France, and Germany. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated on November 2, 2025, that Tehran is ready to negotiate only on its nuclear program, not missile capabilities, and only if talks occur on equal footing and based on mutual interests\u2014though he noted the U.S. is not in a hurry, and Iran is not either.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 04:10 PM\nSource:[GEO TV](https://www.geo.tv/latest/631950-irans-supreme-leader-says-will-not-cooperate-with-us-while-it-backs-israel)\n\n**Iran's Supreme Leader Excludes Any Cooperation with Washington, Citing Support for Israel**\nIran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ruled out any cooperation with Washington, stating that such cooperation could only be considered if the United States completely ceased its support for Israel, withdrew its military bases from the region, and refrained from intervening in the region. He emphasized the 'arrogant nature' of the United States, suggesting it refuses to accept any conditions or compromises. The statement was made on November 3, 2025, and published by Le Figaro.fr.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 01:39 PM\nSource:[Le Figaro.fr](https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/le-guide-supreme-iranien-exclut-toute-cooperation-avec-washington-pointant-du-doigt-son-soutien-a-israel-20251103)\n\n**Iran's Supreme Leader Sets Condition for Cooperation with the U.S.: End Support for Israel**\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated that Iran will only resume cooperation with the United States if Washington ceases supporting Israel. 'Americans sometimes say they want to cooperate with Iran. Cooperation with Iran is impossible as long as the U.S. continues to support the accursed Zionist regime, maintains military bases, and interferes in regional affairs,' Khamenei said, according to Reuters. He added that there is no expectation of restored relations between Tehran and Washington in the near future, and any potential normalization would only occur later. In October 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump stated his readiness to strike a deal with Iran if Tehran is willing to take the initiative, emphasizing that 'the hand of friendship and cooperation is open.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 12:53 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8179468)\n\n**Iran Khamenei says will not cooperate with US while it backs Israel**\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated on November 3, 2025, that Iran would only consider cooperation with the United States if it ceased supporting Israel, withdrew its military bases from the region, and stopped interfering in regional affairs. He emphasized that the 'arrogant nature of the United States accepts nothing other than submission.' These remarks were made during a student gathering in Tehran commemorating the 1979 takeover of the U.S. embassy, a pivotal event in the Islamic Revolution. The statement follows a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel that began in mid-June 2025, during which Israel launched a major bombing campaign, prompting Iran to respond with missile and drone strikes. The U.S. briefly joined the conflict with strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, disrupting nuclear negotiations that had commenced in April 2025. A ceasefire has been in place since June 24, 2025. Khamenei asserted that 'if the country becomes strong and the enemy realises that confronting this strong nation will not yield profit but will bring loss, the country will certainly gain immunity.' Iran continues to face severe international sanctions, including the reimposition of UN sanctions under the 'snapback' mechanism in September 2025 by Britain, France, and Germany, after the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal in 2018. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in an interview with Al Jazeera on November 2, 2025, affirmed that Tehran remains 'ready to enter negotiations' with Washington\u2014but only on its nuclear program, excluding missile capabilities. He added that talks could resume 'whenever the Americans are ready to negotiate on an equal footing and based on mutual interests. Apparently, they are not in a hurry. We are not in a hurry either.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 12:18 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/82UN8CQ)\n\n**Iran's Supreme Leader Outlines Key Conditions for Future Cooperation with the U.S.**\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated on November 3, 2025, during a speech to Iranian students commemorating the anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, that Iran will only consider U.S. requests for cooperation if Washington fully ceases supporting Israel, closes its military bases in the Middle East, and stops interfering in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. Khamenei described the existing tensions between Iran and the U.S. as an 'essential conflict of interests,' and emphasized that any potential interaction would be considered 'sometime in the future,' but not in the near term. His remarks were published in the Supreme Leader's Telegram channel.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 11:43 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20251103/iran-2052636156.html)\n\n**Iran's Supreme Leader Rejects Trump's Proposal for Nuclear Talks, Calls It 'Imposition and Intimidation'**\nIran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, rejected a proposal from U.S. President Donald Trump to resume nuclear talks on October 20, 2025, calling such an agreement 'imposition and intimidation' if it involves coercion or predetermined outcomes. Khamenei also dismissed Trump's claim that the U.S. had destroyed Iran's nuclear capabilities, stating, 'Keep dreaming!' He emphasized that U.S. interference in Iran's nuclear program is 'unacceptable, wrong, and coercive.' The rejection comes after five rounds of indirect nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington, which ended in a 12-day conflict in June 2025, during which Israel and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. Despite repeated requests, Iran has denied access to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect a newly accelerated, secret nuclear facility under Mount Kirka near Natanz. Iran has officially declared it will no longer abide by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), stating the agreement's term has expired and is no longer valid. The Ukrainian outlet OBOZREVATEL reported that Iran has ceased compliance with its nuclear restrictions.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/novosti-mir/tse-ne-ugoda-a-navyazuvannya-i-zalyakuvannya-lider-iranu-vidhiliv-propozitsiyu-trampa-pro-vidnovlennya-peregovoriv.htm)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
