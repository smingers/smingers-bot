Fourteen days later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from 15 years of exile and took control of Iran.\n\n---\n\n### Key Historical Context\n- **1941:** British and Soviet occupation of Iran led to the first Pahlavi shah abdicating in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza.\n- **1953:** After being briefly ousted due to Premier Mosaddeq's popularity, the shah was restored to sole power via a British-U.S. intelligence coup.\n- **1963:** The shah launched the \"White Revolution\" \u2014 land reform, infrastructure development, women's voting rights, and literacy programs \u2014 which drew criticism from Islamic leaders who saw it as westernization.\n- **1964:** Khomeini was exiled to Iraq, from where he continued inciting opposition via radio broadcasts.\n\n### Factors Leading to the Shah's Fall\n- Growing religious discontent and the shah's increasingly repressive response, including use of a brutal secret police\n- Economic grievances among poor and middle classes who felt excluded from White Revolution benefits\n- **September 8, 1978:** Security forces killed hundreds of demonstrators\n- **December 11, 1978:** A soldier mutiny attacked the shah's security officers, effectively collapsing his regime\n\n### Aftermath\n- The shah traveled through multiple countries before entering the **United States in October 1979** for cancer treatment\n- In response, Islamic militants stormed the U.S. embassy on **November 4, 1979**, taking 52 hostages for **444 days**, demanding the shah's return to stand trial\n- **Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi died in Egypt in July 1980**\n\n---\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question\nThis article is cited in the question's fine print as a **precedent example**: Metaculus notes that a hypothetical question about the Shah's 1979 departure would have resolved **Yes** based on the preponderance of reporting, even though Pahlavi never formally relinquished his title as Shah. This establishes the interpretive framework for assessing whether Khamenei has \"ceased to be Supreme Leader.\"\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ygl4lpl1o\">\n## Summary: \"What Now for Iran's Supreme Leader?\" (BBC, January 16, 2026)\n\n### Khamenei's Current Situation\n- Khamenei is reportedly hiding in a **secret bunker/hideout**, described as a \"marked man\" who will not be appearing publicly anytime soon.\n- Trump has referenced the fates of **Qassem Soleimani** (killed by US drone strike), **Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi** (killed in US raid), and **Hassan Nasrallah** (killed in Israeli airstrike underground) when discussing options regarding Khamenei \u2014 implying potential targeted action.\n- The **recent US kidnapping of Venezuelan President Maduro** in a commando raid is also noted as likely weighing on Khamenei's mind.\n\n### Protests and Regime Stability\n- **Ongoing protests** in Iran have been driven primarily by **economic grievances** \u2014 currency collapse, poverty, shortages of water, electricity, and gas \u2014 rather than solely political/religious issues as in 2022.\n- Security forces have **massacred thousands of protesters**, including in villages, with internet shutdowns limiting full visibility of casualties.\n- Despite the unrest, **no significant dissent or disloyalty** has been detected within the Revolutionary Guard.\n- Trump has encouraged protesters to \"occupy government buildings,\" stating \"Help is on its way.\"\n\n### Potential Successors/Power Vacuum\nSeveral figures are discussed as potential successors if Khamenei is removed:\n\n- **Revolutionary Guard / Military Rule**: Most likely immediate outcome, with parliament speaker **Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf** (64, ex-IRGC) cited as a possible figure, though Khamenei never fully trusted him.\n- **Hassan Rouhani** (former moderate president): Positioning himself for reformist/moderate Islamist support.\n- **Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi** (65, in exile in Washington): Popular in street protests, but lacks organizational base inside Iran and is considered a **divisive figure** who has failed to unite the opposition abroad.\n\n### Expert Opinions\n- **Arash Azizi (Yale University)**: Says a \"significant section of the ruling elite\" may *welcome* Khamenei's removal as an opportunity to change core policies, and might even welcome US attacks to accelerate that process.\n- **Ali Ansari (University of St Andrews)**: Argues reformists are \"largely irrelevant\" and \"completely marginalised\" \u2014 the divide is simply between \"rulers and the ruled.\" Also notes Iran's infrastructure problems are deeply structural, stemming from lack of investment 20 years ago.\n- **Dr. Sanam Vakil (Chatham House)**: States the protests are about \"completely transforming Iranian governance\" away from the existing system of nearly five decades \u2014 suggesting no easy accommodation is possible.\n\n### Khamenei's Outlook\n- Khamenei has **acknowledged traders' economic grievances** but blamed \"enemies\" for the problems.\n- He is assessed as likely to **\"plough on with an iron fist,\"** believing his rule is divinely sanctioned.\n- The article notes that even if current protests subside, Iranians have historically returned to protest repeatedly (2009, 2019, 2022, and now).\n</QuestionSource>\n"
