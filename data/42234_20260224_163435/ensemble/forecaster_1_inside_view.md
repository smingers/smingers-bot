## (a) Source Analysis

**Slate.com (August 2025):** Travel feature article citing Finland's 2025 WHR score as 7.736. This is the three-year average (2022-2024), not the annual 2025 figure. Moderate quality—journalistic, not primary source. The 7.736 figure is confirmed by multiple other sources as the three-year average.

**WBAL TV (March 20, 2025):** News report on 2025 WHR. Confirms Finland #1 for 8th consecutive year. Notes rankings based on 3-year averages (2022-2024). No annual score provided. Reliable news source, but doesn't give the annual figure needed for resolution.

**AP News (March 20, 2025):** Authoritative news source confirming 2025 WHR results. Finland #1, rankings based on 3-year averages. No annual score. High quality source, but doesn't resolve the specific metric needed.

**BBC (March 20, 2025):** Reports Finland's score as 7.736—explicitly the three-year average for the 2025 WHR. High quality source. Confirms 7.736 is the three-year average, not the annual 2025 figure.

**UPI (March 20, 2025):** Confirms Finland #1, three-year average 7.736. Reliable. Same caveat—three-year average only.

**Al Jazeera (March 20, 2025):** Confirms Finland #1 in 2025 WHR. No specific score provided. Reliable.

**International Business Times Australia (February 7, 2026):** **KEY SOURCE.** Reports on the 2026 WHR, stating "Finland retained the top spot for the ninth year in a row with a score of 7.74." This appears to be the 2026 WHR three-year average (2023-2025). The article also mentions Australia ranked 11th with a score of 6.97-7.06. This is a pre-publication preview or early release article. Moderate quality—IBT Australia is not a primary source, and the article was published February 7, 2026, before the official March 20 release. The 7.74 figure for Finland in the 2026 WHR is significant.

**RTE.ie (November 25, 2025):** Reputable Irish broadcaster. States "Gallup survey data for 2026 shows no significant decline in Finns' self-reported happiness." This is strong contextual evidence that the 2025 annual score (which feeds into 2026 WHR) will not show dramatic decline. High quality source.

**The Star/similar outlet (November 25, 2025):** Similar article about Finland's happiness amid economic challenges. Confirms 2025 WHR ranking but notes economic headwinds. Moderate quality.

**Travelbinger (January 24, 2026):** Reports Finland's score as 7.741 for 2024 WHR. This appears to be a rounding of the three-year average. Low-moderate quality aggregator.

**TheGlobalEconomy.com (from outside view):** Reports 2025 annual score as 7.74. Data aggregator—moderate quality.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
1. **IBT Australia (Feb 7, 2026) reporting 2026 WHR score of 7.74 for Finland.** If this is accurate, it represents the three-year average for 2023-2025. This is the most direct evidence available about what the 2026 WHR will show. However, this is the three-year average, not the annual 2025 figure. The annual 2025 figure could differ from 7.74.

2. **RTE.ie stating "Gallup survey data for 2026 shows no significant decline in Finns' self-reported happiness."** This is strong evidence that the 2025 annual score will be in a similar range to recent years.

3. **Historical stability of Finland's scores (7.660-7.889 range over 2016-2024).** Strong predictive power—Finland's scores are remarkably stable.

**Moderate evidence:**
4. **The 2025 WHR three-year average of 7.736 (2022-2024).** If the 2026 WHR three-year average (2023-2025) is 7.74 (per IBT Australia), then: 7.74 × 3 = 23.22. If 2023 annual ≈ 7.80 and 2024 annual ≈ 7.59 (implied from earlier calculations), then 2025 annual ≈ 23.22 - 7.80 - 7.59 = 7.83. This would represent a rebound.

5. **Economic headwinds in Finland (unemployment ~10%, GDP growth 0.3%).** This is a negative factor, but RTE.ie notes happiness hasn't declined despite this. Moderate negative pressure.

**Weak evidence:**
6. **Various travel/lifestyle articles** about Finland's happiness culture—these don't provide quantitative data.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question resolves by March 21, 2026—approximately 25 days from now (February 24, 2026). The 2026 WHR is expected to be published around March 20, 2026 (International Day of Happiness). The annual 2025 figure should be available at that time.

If the timeframe were halved (~12 days), the prediction would be essentially the same—the WHR publication date is fixed. If doubled (~50 days), the prediction would still be the same since the WHR would have been published by then.

The critical uncertainty is: what is the annual 2025 score vs. the three-year average? The IBT Australia article reports 7.74 as Finland's score in the 2026 WHR—this is likely the three-year average (2023-2025), not the annual 2025 figure.

## (d) Justification

**Key calculation:** If the 2026 WHR three-year average (2023-2025) = 7.74, and:
- 2023 annual score ≈ 7.80 (estimated from trend)
- 2024 annual score ≈ 7.59 (implied from 2025 WHR three-year average calculation)
- Then 2025 annual = 3 × 7.74 - 7.80 - 7.59 = 23.22 - 15.39 = 7.83

However, my earlier estimates of 2023 and 2024 annual scores carry significant uncertainty. Let me reconsider:

From 2025 WHR (avg 2022-2024) = 7.736:
- 2022 + 2023 + 2024 = 23.208

From 2024 WHR (avg 2021-2023) = 7.781:
- 2021 + 2022 + 2023 = 23.343

Difference: 2024 annual - 2021 annual = 23.208 - 23.343 = -0.135
So 2024 annual was 0.135 lower than 2021 annual.

If 2021 annual ≈ 7.84 (consistent with the high scores around 2020-2021), then 2024 annual ≈ 7.705. But this is uncertain.

Actually, the data.worldhappiness.report website shows annual scores. The question background says 2024 annual = 7.781. Wait—the question background says "For 2024, Finland's average score was 7.781." This appears to be the annual score for 2024 (as shown on the website), not the three-year average.

If 2024 annual = 7.781 (per question background), and 2025 WHR three-year average (2022-2024) = 7.736, then:
- 2022 + 2023 + 2024 = 23.208
- 2022 + 2023 = 23.208 - 7.781 = 15.427
- Average of 2022 and 2023 = 7.714

This is consistent with a gradual decline from 2020 peak.

Now for 2026 WHR three-year average (2023-2025) = 7.74 (per IBT Australia):
- 2023 + 2024 + 2025 = 23.22
- 2024 annual = 7.781 (per question background)
- 2023 annual = 15.427 - 2022 annual

If 2022 annual ≈ 7.66 (the low end of historical range), then 2023 annual ≈ 7.77.
Then 2025 annual = 23.22 - 7.77 - 7.781 = 7.669.

If 2022 annual ≈ 7.70, then 2023 annual ≈ 7.73.
Then 2025 annual = 23.22 - 7.73 - 7.781 = 7.709.

If 2022 annual ≈ 7.75, then 2023 annual ≈ 7.68.
Then 2025 annual = 23.22 - 7.68 - 7.781 = 7.759.

The range of implied 2025 annual scores is roughly 7.67-7.83, depending on the 2022 annual score.

**Critical caveat:** The IBT Australia article (Feb 7, 2026) may not be perfectly accurate about the 2026 WHR score of 7.74. It's a pre-publication article from a moderate-quality source. The actual 2026 WHR may differ slightly.

**The RTE.ie statement** that "Gallup survey data for 2026 shows no significant decline in Finns' self-reported happiness" is strong evidence that the 2025 annual score will be in the normal range (7.66-7.89), not dramatically lower.

**Synthesis:** The most likely range for Finland's 2025 annual score is 7.65-7.85, with a central estimate around 7.72-7.76. The IBT Australia figure of 7.74 (if it's the three-year average) combined with the implied calculations suggests the annual 2025 score is likely in the 7.67-7.76 range, possibly higher if 2022 was a strong year.

Given the uncertainty about the exact 2022 annual score and the reliability of the IBT Australia figure, I'll center my distribution around 7.74 with moderate spread.

## Distribution Calibration

**Base rate:** Historical annual scores 7.660-7.889 (2016-2024), mean ~7.78, recent trend downward toward 7.73-7.78.

**Inside view adjustments:**
- IBT Australia suggests 2026 WHR three-year average = 7.74 → implies 2025 annual in range 7.67-7.83
- RTE.ie confirms no significant decline in 2025/2026 Gallup data
- Economic headwinds (unemployment 10%) create mild downward pressure
- Historical stability argues against extreme values

**Central estimate:** ~7.74 (aligning with the IBT Australia figure as a rough anchor, recognizing the annual score could differ from the three-year average)

## Checklist

1. **Target variable:** Finland's annual happiness score for 2025 (Cantril ladder, 0-10 scale), as published on data.worldhappiness.report, expected ~March 20, 2026.

2. **Outside view base rate:** Historical range 7.660-7.889, mean ~7.78, recent downward trend. Outside view centered ~7.74.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 7.74; mean ≈ 7.74; this aligns with IBT Australia's 7.74 figure and the historical trend.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - IBT Australia (Feb 7, 2026): 2026 WHR score 7.74 for Finland (three-year average, not annual)
   - RTE.ie: No significant decline in Gallup 2026 data for Finland
   - Historical annual scores range 7.660-7.889 with downward trend from 2020 peak
   - Question background: 2024 annual score = 7.781

5. **Blind spot:** The annual 2025 score could differ substantially from the three-year average. If 2022 was a particularly high year, the 2025 annual could be lower (~7.65). If 2022 was low, 2025 annual could be higher (~7.83). This uncertainty is the main risk.

6. **Status quo:** Finland's scores are remarkably stable. The status quo is continuation near 7.74-7.78.

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing, units are Cantril ladder score (0-10), within bounds (7.5-8.0) for central estimates, with tails extending slightly beyond.
