Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Wikipedia (International Day of Happiness):** Establishes that the WHR is published around March 20 each year. No quantitative data on Finland's scores. Factual, reliable for context only.

**CNBC (March 20, 2024):** Reports Finland's 2024 WHR score as 7.741. This conflicts slightly with the question background (7.781) and the Mental Floss source (7.736 for 2025). The 7.741 figure may be a rounding or early-release discrepancy. The question background states 7.781 as the 2024 score, which I'll treat as authoritative.

**TheGlobalEconomy.com:** Reports Finland's 2025 annual score as 7.74, described as "unchanged from 7.74 in 2024." This is a data aggregator site. The figure 7.74 appears to be a rounded version of the three-year average. The "2025" figure here likely refers to the 2025 WHR (three-year average 2022-2024 = 7.736, rounded to 7.74). Useful but requires careful interpretation.

**SWI Swissinfo.ch (March 20, 2025):** Confirms Finland ranked #1 for eighth consecutive year in 2025 WHR. Does not provide the specific numerical score. Credible news source.

**Gallup Global Emotions Report:** Not directly relevant to Finland's ladder score. Provides global emotional wellbeing context.

**Goodnet (March 24, 2025):** Confirms Finland #1 for eighth year. No specific score. Moderate quality source.

**Mental Floss (March 20, 2025):** Reports Finland's 2025 WHR three-year average as 7.736. Explicitly notes this is the three-year average (2022-2024), not the annual 2025 figure. Good quality, important caveat noted.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive synthesis. Key data points:
- 2024 WHR (avg 2021-2023): 7.781
- 2025 WHR (avg 2022-2024): 7.736
- The 2026 WHR will average 2023-2025 data
- Historical range 2016-2024: 7.660-7.889
- Mild downward drift from 2020 peak (7.889) to 2025 (7.736)
- TheGlobalEconomy.com shows 2025 annual score as 7.74

**Critical distinction:** The question asks for Finland's **annual score for 2025** (not the three-year average). The 2026 WHR will publish data averaged over 2023-2025, but the annual 2025 figure is what resolves this question.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Finland's annual WHR scores (2016-2024)**
Range: 7.660 to 7.889. This is the most directly relevant reference class. Mean approximately 7.78, with a mild downward trend from 2020 peak.

**Reference Class 2: Year-over-year changes in Finland's score**
The three-year averages show: 7.781 (2024) → 7.736 (2025), a decline of ~0.045. The annual scores underlying these averages show more volatility. The 2025 three-year average dropped the 2021 data and added 2024 data, implying 2024 annual data was below 2021 data.

**Reference Class 3: Nordic country happiness score stability**
Nordic countries show very stable scores with small year-to-year variation (typically ±0.1-0.2).

The most suitable reference class is Finland's own historical annual scores, combined with the implied trend from the three-year averages.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question resolves by March 21, 2026 (the 2026 WHR release date, which will contain 2025 annual data). This is approximately 25 days from the question opening (February 24, 2026).

The 2026 WHR will be published around March 20, 2026. It will contain:
- A three-year average (2023-2025)
- Annual scores for each year including 2025

Historical patterns show Finland's annual scores have been:
- 2020: 7.889 (peak)
- Gradual decline through 2024: ~7.781
- 2025 three-year average: 7.736

The implied annual 2025 score can be estimated from the three-year averages:
- 2025 three-year avg (2022-2024) = 7.736
- 2024 three-year avg (2021-2023) = 7.781
- This means: (2022 + 2023 + 2024_annual)/3 = 7.736
- And: (2021 + 2022 + 2023)/3 = 7.781

If we assume 2022 annual ≈ 7.82 and 2023 annual ≈ 7.80 (consistent with the downward trend), then:
- 2024 annual ≈ 3 × 7.736 - 7.82 - 7.80 ≈ 23.208 - 15.62 ≈ 7.588

This suggests the 2024 annual score was approximately 7.59, which pulled the 2025 three-year average down.

For the 2026 WHR three-year average (2023-2025):
- If 2023 annual ≈ 7.80, 2024 annual ≈ 7.59, then 2025 annual would need to be about 7.7-7.8 to maintain Finland's position.

The TheGlobalEconomy.com source states the 2025 annual score is 7.74. This appears to be the most direct evidence of the annual 2025 figure.

## (d) Justification

The key data point is TheGlobalEconomy.com reporting Finland's 2025 score as 7.74. This source aggregates WHR data and appears to report annual (not three-year average) figures. The question background notes the 2024 annual score was 7.781, and TheGlobalEconomy.com states 2025 is "unchanged from 7.74 in 2024" - suggesting they may be using a slightly different rounding or vintage of the 2024 data.

Given:
1. Finland's historical stability in the 7.66-7.89 range
2. The mild downward trend from 2020 peak
3. TheGlobalEconomy.com reporting 7.74 for 2025
4. The implied annual 2024 score of ~7.59 from three-year average calculations (which would suggest a bounce-back in 2025 toward ~7.74)
5. No structural shocks to Finnish society that would dramatically alter scores

The most likely annual 2025 score is approximately 7.74, with uncertainty of roughly ±0.10-0.15.

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should be centered around 7.74, with the historical range (7.66-7.89 for 2016-2024, and possibly lower given the 2024 annual implied ~7.59) informing the tails.

- The downside risk: If 2025 annual data continues the decline, scores could approach 7.6-7.65
- The upside risk: A rebound toward 7.8+ is possible but less likely given recent trends
- TheGlobalEconomy.com's 7.74 figure is the strongest direct evidence for the annual 2025 score
- The distribution should be slightly left-skewed given the downward trend

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7.60
Percentile 20: 7.67
Percentile 40: 7.72
Percentile 60: 7.76
Percentile 80: 7.82
Percentile 90: 7.87
