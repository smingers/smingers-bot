**(a) Source Analysis**

**Primary resolution-relevant sources:**

1. **BBC (March 20, 2025)** – High quality, reliable news outlet. Reports Finland's 2025 WHR three-year average score as **7.736**, #1 for 8th consecutive year. This is the three-year average (2022-2024), NOT the annual 2025 figure needed for resolution.

2. **Slate (August 2025)** – Travel feature article citing Finland's score as **7.736** from the 2025 WHR. Confirms the three-year average but conflates it with Finland's "average score." Not a primary source but corroborates the three-year average.

3. **WBAL, AP News, UPI, Al Jazeera (March 2025)** – Multiple mainstream outlets confirming Finland #1 with three-year average 7.736. Consistent and reliable for ranking/three-year average, but none report the annual 2025 figure.

4. **International Business Times Australia (February 7, 2026)** – Reports the **2026 WHR** with Finland retaining top spot for 9th year with a score of **7.74**. This is a forward-looking article about the 2026 WHR (which uses 2023-2025 data). This is highly relevant. The article states Finland scored 7.74 in the 2026 WHR (three-year average 2023-2025). This is a moderate-quality source but provides a concrete data point. If the 2026 WHR three-year average is 7.74, and the 2025 WHR three-year average was 7.736, this implies the 2025 annual data point is slightly above 7.74 (since the 2026 three-year average drops the 2022 data and adds 2025 data).

5. **RTE.ie (November 25, 2025)** – Reputable Irish broadcaster. Critically states: **"Gallup survey data for 2026 shows no significant decline in Finns' self-reported happiness"** — this refers to data collected in 2025 (labeled "2026" in Gallup's convention, which is one year ahead). This is strong evidence that the 2025 annual score won't show a dramatic drop.

6. **The Star/RTE (November 2025)** – Discusses Finland's economic challenges (10%+ unemployment, fiscal strain) but notes happiness remains stable. Expert John Helliwell quoted on resilience. Moderate quality.

7. **TheGlobalEconomy.com (referenced in outside view)** – Data aggregator showing Finland's 2025 single-year value as 7.74. Medium quality but consistent with other signals.

8. **Travelbinger (January 24, 2026)** – Mentions Finland's score as 7.741 for 2024 WHR. This appears to be referencing the 2024 WHR annual figure, consistent with background info (7.781 for 2024 annual score per the question background — though there's a discrepancy; the question says 7.781 for 2024 annual, while Travelbinger says 7.741 which may be the three-year average from 2024 WHR).

**Key clarification on data structure:** The WHR publishes both:
- Three-year averages (used for rankings): 2025 WHR = 7.736 (avg of 2022, 2023, 2024 annual scores)
- Annual scores: The question resolves on the **annual 2025** figure

The 2026 WHR (three-year average of 2023, 2024, 2025) = 7.74 per IBT Australia. If we denote annual scores as S(year):
- 2025 WHR three-year avg = [S(2022) + S(2023) + S(2024)] / 3 = 7.736
- 2026 WHR three-year avg = [S(2023) + S(2024) + S(2025)] / 3 = 7.74

From the question background: S(2024) annual = 7.781. 

Working backwards:
- S(2022) + S(2023) + S(2024) = 3 × 7.736 = 23.208
- S(2023) + S(2024) + S(2025) = 3 × 7.74 = 23.22

Subtracting: S(2025) - S(2022) = 23.22 - 23.208 = 0.012

So S(2025) = S(2022) + 0.012

Historical data suggests S(2022) ≈ 7.82 (based on the pattern where three-year averages in 2023 WHR used 2020-2022 data averaging ~7.82). Actually, let me recalculate more carefully.

From WHR data portal (background): Finland's annual scores ranged from 7.660 (2016) to 7.889 (2020), with 2024 annual = 7.781.

If 2025 WHR three-year avg (2022+2023+2024)/3 = 7.736:
- S(2022) + S(2023) = 3×7.736 - 7.781 = 23.208 - 7.781 = 15.427
- S(2022) + S(2023) = 15.427, so avg of 2022+2023 = 7.7135

If 2026 WHR three-year avg (2023+2024+2025)/3 = 7.74:
- S(2023) + S(2025) = 3×7.74 - 7.781 = 23.22 - 7.781 = 15.439
- S(2023) + S(2025) = 15.439

From above: S(2022) + S(2023) = 15.427
If S(2022) ≈ 7.72 (reasonable given trend), then S(2023) ≈ 7.707
Then S(2025) = 15.439 - 7.707 = **7.732**

Alternatively if S(2022) ≈ 7.74, S(2023) ≈ 7.687, S(2025) ≈ 7.752.

The range of plausible S(2025) values given the IBT Australia data point is approximately **7.70–7.78**, with a central estimate around **7.73–7.74**.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- IBT Australia (Feb 7, 2026) reporting 2026 WHR Finland score of 7.74 (three-year average 2023-2025). If accurate, this mathematically constrains the 2025 annual score to approximately 7.70-7.78 range. This is the most directly relevant data point. However, IBT Australia is not a primary source and could be previewing/estimating rather than reporting actual published data. The 2026 WHR would typically be published March 20, 2026, which is after today (Feb 24, 2026). This article from Feb 7, 2026 appears to be anticipatory/predictive rather than reporting actual published results. **This significantly reduces its reliability** — it may be a speculative preview piece.

- RTE.ie (Nov 2025) noting Gallup 2026 survey data shows no significant decline in Finnish happiness. This is moderate-strong evidence from a reputable broadcaster citing Gallup data directly.

- Historical stability: Finland's annual scores have never moved more than ~0.15 in a single year. The series is mean-reverting around 7.75-7.80.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Economic headwinds in Finland (10%+ unemployment, fiscal austerity) could modestly depress happiness scores. However, the RTE article explicitly notes this hasn't translated to survey declines.

- The downward trend since 2020 peak (7.889) suggests continued modest decline, but the pace has slowed.

**Weak evidence:**
- Travel articles and lifestyle pieces about Finnish happiness culture — anecdotal, no quantitative data.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The 2026 WHR is expected to be published March 20, 2026 — approximately 24 days from now. The data (annual 2025 Gallup surveys) is already collected and processed. The outcome is essentially fixed; only publication remains.

If the timeframe were halved (i.e., we were predicting 6 months earlier), uncertainty would be higher as 2025 survey data would not yet be collected. If doubled (6 months after publication), the answer would be known with certainty.

The near-certainty of publication before the May 1, 2026 annulment deadline means this question will almost certainly resolve.

**(d) Justification**

Starting from the outside view base rate (mean ~7.74, σ ~0.07):

1. **IBT Australia article (Feb 7, 2026)**: Claims 2026 WHR Finland = 7.74. This is likely a preview/estimate piece published before the actual WHR release (March 20, 2026). The article may be using preliminary data or extrapolating. If taken at face value, it implies S(2025) annual ≈ 7.73 ± 0.05. This moderately anchors the distribution around 7.73-7.74.

2. **RTE.ie Gallup data**: "No significant decline" in 2025 Gallup data. This rules out large downward moves (below 7.60) with high confidence.

3. **Economic challenges**: Finland's unemployment at 10%+ and fiscal austerity are genuine headwinds. Research shows economic conditions affect happiness with a lag. However, the welfare state cushions this, and the RTE article's Gallup data confirms no major impact.

4. **Historical trend**: Gentle decline from 7.889 (2020) toward ~7.74 (2024). Extrapolating suggests 2025 annual ≈ 7.72-7.76.

5. **Three-year average arithmetic**: The 2025 WHR three-year average of 7.736 and the implied 2026 WHR three-year average of ~7.74 (per IBT) suggest S(2025) ≈ 7.73, consistent with the trend.

The convergence of multiple signals around 7.73-7.76 is notable. I'll center my distribution at approximately **7.74** with moderate uncertainty (σ ≈ 0.06), slightly tighter than the outside view given the additional constraints.

**Distribution Calibration:**

Central estimate: 7.74
Uncertainty: σ ≈ 0.06 (slightly tighter than outside view due to additional constraints)

The IBT Australia article, while potentially speculative, provides a concrete anchor. The RTE Gallup data rules out large downside moves. Economic headwinds create slight downside skew.

**Checklist:**

1. **Target variable**: Finland's annual happiness score for 2025 per WHR data portal (0-10 Cantril ladder scale), published by March 21, 2026. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate**: Mean ~7.74, σ ~0.07, range 7.65-7.84 (10th-90th). My inside view centers at 7.74 with slightly tighter σ ≈ 0.06. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 7.74; mean = 7.74; this aligns with the trend analysis and IBT Australia data point. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - IBT Australia (Feb 2026): 2026 WHR Finland = 7.74 (three-year avg) → implies annual 2025 ≈ 7.73 [moderate reliability — pre-publication preview]
   - RTE.ie (Nov 2025): Gallup 2025 data shows no significant happiness decline [strong, reputable source]
   - Historical trend: Gentle decline from 7.889 (2020) to ~7.78 (2024 annual) [strong predictive power]
   - 2025 WHR three-year avg = 7.736 [strong, confirmed by multiple sources]
   - Economic headwinds (10%+ unemployment) [moderate, but cushioned by welfare state]

5. **Blind spot**: The IBT Australia article may be inaccurate/speculative — if the actual 2026 WHR three-year average is significantly different (e.g., 7.70 or 7.78), my distribution could be off-center. This could push the outcome either direction by ~0.03-0.05.

6. **Status quo**: Finland's scores are remarkably stable. The status quo (continuation of recent trend) points to ~7.74-7.76. Slight nudge toward status quo is appropriate.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing ✓; units are dimensionless 0-10 scale ✓; all values within stated bounds (7.5-8.0) ✓; slight extension below 7.5 for tail ✓.
