Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Wikipedia (International Day of Happiness):** Establishes that the WHR is published on March 20 annually. No quantitative data on Finland's scores. Reliable for procedural context only.

**CNBC (March 2024):** Reports Finland's 2024 WHR score as 7.741 — slightly different from the question background's 7.781. This discrepancy likely reflects that CNBC reported the three-year average score differently, or used a different rounding/vintage. The question background explicitly states 7.781 for 2024. Treat with moderate caution on exact figures.

**TheGlobalEconomy.com:** Reports Finland's 2025 annual score as **7.74**, described as "unchanged from 7.74 in 2024." This is a key data point — it appears to be reporting the *annual* 2025 figure (not the three-year average), which is exactly what the question resolves on. However, this source may be using rounded figures and could be pulling from the WHR data portal. The 2025 WHR three-year average is confirmed as 7.736 by multiple sources.

**SWI Swissinfo (March 2025):** Confirms Finland ranked #1 for the 8th consecutive year in the 2025 WHR. Does not provide Finland's specific numerical score. Reliable news source.

**Gallup Global Emotions Report:** Not directly relevant to Finland's ladder score. Provides global emotional wellbeing context. Low relevance.

**Goodnet (March 2025):** Confirms Finland #1 in 2025 WHR, no specific score given. Reliable secondary source.

**Mental Floss (March 2025):** Reports Finland's 2025 WHR score as **7.736** — explicitly noting this is the three-year average (2022–2024). This is the published WHR ranking score, NOT the annual 2025 figure. Important distinction for resolution.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive synthesis. Key insight: The 2025 WHR three-year average is 7.736 (covering 2022–2024 data). The question resolves on the *annual* 2025 figure (single-year Gallup data for 2025). TheGlobalEconomy.com reports 7.74 as the 2025 annual figure. The agent notes that the 2026 WHR will average 2023–2025 data. The question asks for the annual 2025 score as it will appear on the WHR data portal.

**Critical distinction:** The question resolves on Finland's *annual* score for 2025 (single-year estimate), not the three-year average. The WHR data portal (data.worldhappiness.report/country/FIN) publishes both. TheGlobalEconomy.com (which draws from this portal) reports 7.74 for 2025 annual.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Finland's annual WHR scores (2016–2024)**
- Range: 7.660 (2016) to 7.889 (2020)
- Recent trajectory: declining from 2020 peak, with 2024 at 7.781
- Most suitable reference class — directly comparable

**Reference Class 2: Year-over-year changes in Finland's annual score**
- Changes have been modest: typically ±0.05 to ±0.15 per year
- The three-year average dropped ~0.045 from 2024 to 2025 WHR
- Annual scores can be more volatile than three-year averages

**Reference Class 3: Nordic country score stability**
- Nordic countries show remarkable stability; scores rarely move >0.1 in a single year
- Structural factors (welfare state, trust, institutions) are highly stable

The most suitable reference class is Finland's own historical annual scores, with particular weight on recent years (2022–2024).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question resolves by March 21, 2026 — essentially when the 2026 WHR is published (expected March 20, 2026). The 2026 WHR will contain 2025 annual data. Today is February 24, 2026, so the report is ~24 days away.

Historical patterns: Finland's annual scores have been stable in the 7.66–7.89 range. The most recent annual data point available is from TheGlobalEconomy.com showing 7.74 for 2025 — this may already reflect the 2025 annual score as published on the WHR data portal (since the 2025 WHR was published March 2025 and contains annual data through 2024).

Wait — I need to clarify: The 2025 WHR (published March 2025) covers data from 2022–2024. The annual score for 2025 would be published in the 2026 WHR (to be released March 2026). TheGlobalEconomy.com's "2025" figure of 7.74 likely refers to the annual 2024 data point as labeled on the WHR portal (which labels data by survey year, not report year).

Looking at the question more carefully: it asks for "Finland's average annual happiness score for 2025 according to the World Happiness Report website." This means the single-year Gallup survey data collected in 2025, which will appear in the 2026 WHR.

## (d) Justification

**Key considerations:**

1. **Historical stability**: Finland's annual scores have ranged 7.66–7.89 over 2016–2024, with a standard deviation of roughly 0.06-0.08. The recent trend shows modest decline from the 2020 peak.

2. **Recent trajectory**: The three-year averages have been declining: 7.889 (2020) → 7.781 (2024 WHR) → 7.736 (2025 WHR). The 2025 WHR average of 7.736 incorporates 2022, 2023, and 2024 annual data. If the 2024 annual data pulled the average down, it may be around 7.65-7.70.

3. **Structural factors**: No major shocks to Finnish society, institutions, or economy that would dramatically alter happiness scores. Finland's welfare state and social trust remain intact.

4. **The 2025 annual score**: Will be collected during 2025 Gallup surveys. Given the mild downward trend, a score in the 7.65–7.80 range seems most likely.

5. **Inferring from three-year averages**: 
   - 2025 WHR (avg 2022-2024) = 7.736
   - 2024 WHR (avg 2021-2023) = 7.781
   - If 2021 annual ≈ 7.84 and 2024 annual ≈ X: 7.736 = (7.84 + Y_2023 + X_2024)/3... This gets complex without individual annual data.
   - The agent report notes the 2025 score of 7.736 implies 2024 data pulled the average down from 7.781.
   - Working backwards: if 2021 ≈ 7.84, 2022 ≈ 7.82, 2023 ≈ 7.80, 2024 ≈ 7.65 (rough estimate to get 2025 avg of 7.736)
   - This suggests 2024 annual may be around 7.65-7.70

6. **2025 annual forecast**: Given the mild downward trend, the 2025 annual score is likely similar to or slightly below the 2024 annual (~7.65-7.75). No structural reasons for a sharp reversal upward or downward.

**Central estimate**: ~7.70, with uncertainty range of 7.60–7.80.

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should be centered around 7.70 with moderate spread. Finland's scores have historically been very stable (low variance). The standard deviation of annual scores over 2016–2024 is approximately 0.07. Given the mild downward trend from the 2020 peak, I'll center slightly below the historical mean of ~7.78.

Key anchors:
- 10th percentile: ~7.58 (would require an unusual downward shock, but not impossible given 2013 minimum of 7.39)
- 90th percentile: ~7.82 (would require a reversal of the downward trend, back toward 2020 levels)

The distribution should be slightly left-skewed given the recent downward trend from the 2020 peak.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7.60
Percentile 20: 7.65
Percentile 40: 7.70
Percentile 60: 7.74
Percentile 80: 7.78
Percentile 90: 7.82
