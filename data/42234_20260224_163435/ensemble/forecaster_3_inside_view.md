Analysis:
1) Target / resolution alignment  
This resolves to Finland’s **annual (single-year) Cantril ladder average for survey year 2025** as shown on **data.worldhappiness.report/country/FIN** (not the 3-year average), expected in the WHR released around March 20, 2026.

(a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; date)
- Slate travel feature (Aug 2025): Lifestyle/first-person. Mentions “2025 score 7.736” but is not a primary data source; likely repeating the widely reported **WHR 2025 3-year average**. Low weight for annual-2025.
- WBAL / AP / BBC / UPI / Al Jazeera (all Mar 20, 2025): Reputable outlets summarizing WHR 2025. They clearly tie rankings to **3-year averages (2022–2024)**; BBC/UPI cite Finland **7.736** (3-year avg). High quality for *context* and level, but **not directly the annual-2025 number**.
- AskNews: International Business Times Australia (Feb 7, 2026): Claims “WHR 2026” results (Finland “7.74”) and explicitly describes **3-year averaging (2023–2025)**. Timing is suspicious (WHR typically March 20); could be a premature/incorrect piece. Treat as **moderate-to-weak** evidence about the likely *level* of Finland’s recent happiness, but still **not the annual-2025 figure**.
- AskNews: RTE.ie / The Star (Nov 25, 2025): Reputable journalism focusing on Finland’s economy/unemployment and welfare cuts; includes an attributed claim that Gallup data show no significant decline (vague). Moderate quality; relevant to directionality for 2025 annual.
- AskNews: InstaForex unemployment snippet (Feb 24, 2026): Secondary/market commentary; small signal only.
- Other AskNews lifestyle/travel pieces (Travel And Tour World, Terra, etc.): Promotional/soft content; low evidentiary value for the Gallup ladder annual score.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (moves forecast more)
- Historical stability of Finland’s WHR annual ladder scores (tight band; low year-to-year volatility). This is the best predictor of next year’s annual value.

Moderate evidence (some shift)
- Multiple reliable outlets agree Finland remains #1 with **3-year avg ~7.736** in WHR 2025 (anchors the general level near mid–high 7.7s).
- Late-2025 reporting of economic stagnation, high unemployment, and benefit cuts (credible mechanisms for a small downward pull on life evaluations, especially if felt broadly).

Weak evidence (small shift only)
- IBT Australia’s early “WHR 2026” summary with Finland “7.74” (likely 3-year avg, early timing odd; still suggests no collapse).
- January 2026 slight unemployment improvement; tourism/visa-free-travel stories; sports/cultural events (unlikely to materially move a national annual ladder mean).

Net: the evidence mostly supports **“close to status quo”** with mild downside risk from the 2025 economic gloom, partially offset by the general resilience/theme that Finland’s reported wellbeing tends not to swing much with short-term economics.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time to resolution: ~25 days (Feb 24 → Mar 21, 2026).  
If time were halved, I’d narrow uncertainty slightly (less chance of new contradictory reporting, but the underlying value is already “baked in” by completed 2025 polling). If doubled, uncertainty would be similar because the key uncertainty is epistemic (we don’t yet see the annual-2025 figure), not that the value itself is changing.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside view (given) centers Finland’s 2025 annual around low/mid 7.7s with modest spread.  
Inside-view updates:
- The most decision-relevant new info is **credible reporting of Finnish economic strain and welfare tightening in 2025**, which plausibly nudges the 2025 annual a bit lower than a “pure stability” extrapolation.
- Counterweight: Finland’s WHR performance is historically **structural** (trust, institutions, social support), and multiple sources suggest continued top ranking with similar mid–high 7.7 levels in recent reports. I therefore make only a **small downward** adjustment to the center and keep a **wide** 10–90 range for unknown unknowns / annual volatility.

Distribution calibration:
- (a) If current trend continued: mild downward drift from the 2020 peak suggests something like **~7.70–7.75** remains most likely.
- (b) I avoid over-tightening: annual values can bounce more than 3-year averages, and we have limited direct signals about the single-year 2025 mean.
- (c) Tails: Downside tail allows a larger-than-expected dip if economic pessimism or measurement noise hit; upside tail allows a rebound year.
- (d) Sensitivity: shifting all percentiles by ±0.05 would not break the narrative; bigger shifts would require stronger “leak-like” evidence of the annual-2025 value.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Finland’s **annual** Cantril ladder mean for **survey year 2025** on WHR data portal (0–10 scale).  
2. Outside view base distribution (given): P10 7.60, P20 7.65, P40 7.70, P60 7.74, P80 7.78, P90 7.82.  
3. Consistency check: Implied median ≈ 7.73; mean ≈ 7.72–7.74; consistent with “stable, slight downside risk.”  
4. Key evidence (<=20 words each):
   - Finland annual ladder scores historically very stable in a narrow high-7.6 to high-7.8 band.
   - WHR 2025 3-year average for Finland reported ~7.736 by multiple top-tier outlets.
   - Credible late-2025 reporting: stagnation/high unemployment/benefit cuts in Finland could slightly depress 2025 evaluations.
   - Some reporting suggests no major decline in Gallup-measured wellbeing despite economic gloom (vague, partial offset).
5. Blind spot: A methodological/measurement change or an unrecognized shock could push the annual score notably up or down.  
6. Status quo: Expect “near recent values”; don’t overreact to short-run news.  
7. Technicalities: Percentiles strictly increasing; units match (0–10 ladder points); bounds are open so tails can extend.
