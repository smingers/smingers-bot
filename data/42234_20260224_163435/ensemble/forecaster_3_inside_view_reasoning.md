**Analyzing happiness score predictions**

I need to produce an inside view forecast distribution for the annual happiness score for 2025 based on the World Happiness Report (WHR) 2026. The outside view distribution is roughly 7.70-7.74. There's news from IBT Australia suggesting Finland's score for 2026 is 7.74, but that's a three-year average, not just for 2025. While estimates indicate the annual score could be between 7.5 and 8.0, Finnish economic challenges in 2025 might lower this, despite surveys showing stable happiness levels.**Refining happiness score estimates**

I see that the IBT article claims Finland's score is 7.74 in the 2026 report, which is a three-year average from 2023 to 2025. When I compare this to the 2022-2024 average of 7.736, it suggests a slight uptick. The 2025 annual score might be around 7.76, but I need to be cautious as media can round or misreport figures. Another article suggests stability in happiness despite economic gloom, so I might adjust the outside view slightly upward. The current outside distribution shows a median of about 7.72, which I could tweak by factoring in the stability signals.**Establishing score distribution**

I’m looking to set specific percentiles for a distribution: 40th at 7.71, 60th at 7.75, 80th at 7.79, and 90th at 7.83, while also ensuring a strictly increasing order. It seems like the timeline for resolution is about 25 days, but if we have less time, maybe the distribution should narrow. I see the IBT claims the 2026 report was published on February 7, 2026, but that feels off since the WHR usually comes out in March. This raises questions about accuracy or possible leaks.**Adjusting score predictions**

If the report has been published, the question might be known before opening it. However, if the resolution could’ve been anticipated, it would likely be annulled, so I want to treat this as potentially hallucinated information from the source, keeping the evidence moderate to weak. I think the annual score is likely to hover around the three-year average of 7.74, allowing for some variability, possibly between 7.65 and 7.85. I’ll set the tails wider, with the 10th percentile at 7.55 and the 90th around 7.86, while being mindful of historical trends.
