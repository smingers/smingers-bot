Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; facts vs opinions)
- **Wikipedia – International Day of Happiness (UN observance)**  
  *What it provides:* Release timing context (World Happiness Report typically around March 20).  
  *Quality/date:* Generally reliable for dates; not directly informative for Finland’s score level.  
  *Facts vs opinions:* Mostly factual (date/history); no score data.

- **CNBC (Mar 20, 2024) – 2024 WHR highlights**  
  *What it provides:* Finland ranked #1; reports a Finland score (article states 7.741). Notes the ladder measure and drivers.  
  *Quality/date:* Reputable outlet; but secondary reporting and can mix up “annual” vs “3-year average” framing.  
  *Facts vs opinions:* The ranking/score are presented as facts but should be checked against WHR primary table; explanatory quotes (e.g., “least unhappy people”) are expert opinion.

- **TheGlobalEconomy.com (table; claims “Latest value (2025): 7.74”)**  
  *What it provides:* A compiled time series and a specific claimed 2025 value (7.74).  
  *Quality/date:* Useful aggregator but not the primary source; possible rounding/definition mismatches versus WHR portal. Treat as *suggestive*, not authoritative.  
  *Facts vs opinions:* Mostly numeric claims; minimal narrative.

- **SWI swissinfo.ch (Mar 20, 2025) & Goodnet (Mar 24, 2025)**  
  *What they provide:* Finland still #1 in the 2025 report; no Finland numeric annual score.  
  *Quality/date:* Swissinfo is fairly solid as secondary reporting; Goodnet is lighter-weight. Both mainly confirm ranking continuity.  
  *Facts vs opinions:* Rank continuity is factual (assuming faithful reporting). Explanations about trust/caring are partly expert quotes (identifiable) and partly narrative.

- **Mental Floss (Mar 20, 2025)**  
  *What it provides:* Finland score 7.736 for the 2025 report, but explicitly in the context of the WHR’s *rolling multi-year average* presentation.  
  *Quality/date:* Popular press; okay for general reporting but not ideal for precise “annual” resolution criteria.  
  *Facts vs opinions:* The number is presented as fact but likely refers to the 3-year average; interpret with care.

- **Gallup “State of the World’s Emotional Health” (global emotional measures)**  
  *What it provides:* Global emotion trends, not Finland’s ladder score.  
  *Quality/date:* High-quality institutional source; indirect relevance only.  
  *Facts vs opinions:* Mostly factual survey reporting.

- **Agent report (compiled historical series + commentary)**  
  *What it provides:* A stitched-together history and narrative drivers; highlights stability and slight recent dip. Also flags methodological confusion: WHR commonly emphasizes rolling averages.  
  *Quality/date:* Mixed—some numbers appear approximate/estimated for early years; useful for qualitative structure and rough ranges, but not a primary dataset.  
  *Facts vs opinions:* Some factual claims (e.g., 2016 low 7.660; 2020 high 7.889; 2024 7.781) align with the prompt’s background; many early-year values are explicitly approximate.

**Bottom line on sources:** For an *outside view*, the most dependable anchor is the prompt’s own stated Finland range (7.660–7.889 since 2016) and the general observation that Finland’s score is highly stable year-to-year. Secondary sources help confirm “no regime change” and continuing top rank, but are noisy about the precise “annual vs rolling average” value.

### (b) Reference class analysis
Possible reference classes:
1. **Finland’s own WHR “annual” ladder scores (most suitable).**  
   Pros: Directly maps to the quantity being forecast; captures Finland-specific stability.  
   Cons: Small sample; measurement definitions can shift subtly.

2. **Top-5 Nordic countries’ annual ladder scores.**  
   Pros: Similar institutions/culture; gives a broader sample of variation in the 7.2–7.9 region.  
   Cons: Still not “Finland”; cross-country differences may not generalize to Finland’s year-to-year movement.

3. **All countries’ year-to-year changes in ladder score.**  
   Pros: Big sample for typical volatility.  
   Cons: Finland is unusually stable and high-scoring; global volatility overstates Finland’s likely movement.

**Chosen reference class:** Finland’s own annual series since ~2013 (especially post-2016 stability), supplemented by Nordic stability as a reasonableness check.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time to resolution:** ~1 month (from 2026-02-24 to expected WHR release around 2026-03-20; annulment if not by 2026-05-01).  
- **Key implication:** The underlying 2025 survey data are essentially already collected; remaining uncertainty is mostly *what the published annual number is*, not what Finns will feel in the future. That usually implies *tighter* uncertainty than a long-horizon societal forecast—but because we’re doing an outside view (and sources conflict on definitions), I’ll still keep tails meaningfully wide.

Historical pattern over similar one-year steps:
- Finland’s reported scores have been **high and relatively range-bound** (prompt cites ~7.66 to ~7.889 since 2016).  
- Recent media/aggregators suggest **slight downward drift** from the 2020 peak, but not a sharp break.

---

### (d) Justification for the outside view prediction
Using Finland’s post-2016 range (about **7.66–7.89**) as the main empirical anchor, the simplest outside-view model is “stable around the mid-to-upper 7.7s with modest year-to-year noise and mild mean reversion.”

- **Status quo if nothing changes:** a score near the recent central tendency (~7.75–7.80).  
- **Drivers for a lower-than-expected outcome:** recession/real wage squeeze, domestic political turmoil, worsening perceived safety, sharp fall in trust/institutions, or survey/measurement quirks that disproportionately affect Finland’s ladder responses.  
- **Drivers for a higher-than-expected outcome:** unusually strong economic sentiment year, improved perceived security, or sampling variation.  
- **Upset rate / tail risk:** Ladder scores usually don’t jump dramatically in stable OECD countries, but *measurement/definition issues* (annual vs rolling average reporting) and ordinary sampling error justify keeping a non-trivial tail width.

So my outside-view center is **~7.76**, with a fairly wide 10–90 interval spanning roughly **7.56 to 7.90** to reflect both genuine variation and publication/definition uncertainty.

Outside view calibration:
- I’m tethering to a historical support of roughly **7.66–7.89** (post-2016), but allowing **wider tails** because (i) “annual” values can be noisier than the commonly-cited rolling averages, and (ii) secondary sources show small but real discrepancies/rounding/definition risks.  
- The distribution is mildly skewed *away from extremes*: very high values (>7.95) seem historically rare; very low values (<7.50) would likely require a major shock or a methodological discontinuity.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7.56  
Percentile 20: 7.65  
Percentile 40: 7.72  
Percentile 60: 7.78  
Percentile 80: 7.85  
Percentile 90: 7.90
