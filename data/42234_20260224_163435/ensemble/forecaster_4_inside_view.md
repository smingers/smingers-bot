Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Slate travel piece (Aug 2025) – cites “Finland’s 2025 WHR score 7.736”; secondary journalism, but the number plausibly comes from the WHR tables released five months earlier.  
2. BBC, AP, UPI, WBAL (20 Mar 2025) – all reputable newswires, agree Finland kept #1; only BBC gives 7.736 but explicitly labels it the WHR figure (these outlets usually quote WHR press kit accurately, yet often conflate annual vs 3-yr average).  
3. TheGlobalEconomy.com time-series – data scraper; shows 7.74 for 2025, consistent with 7.736 rounding.  
4. IBTimes AU (7 Feb 2026) – summarises 2026 WHR; gives Finland score 7.74 once more (again almost certainly a 3-yr mean).  
5. AskNews economic & social snippets (Feb 2026) – unemployment 10.3 %, modest deterioration; relevant as a potential downward pressure but effects on ladder score historically small.  
All numeric claims come from, or recycle, the WHR dataset; no evidence of methodological break. Qualitative articles on tourism, culture, sport add little to the 0-to-10 life-evaluation metric.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Three independent mainstream outlets (BBC, Slate, TheGlobalEconomy) quote virtually identical 7.736/7.74 figure for 2025 WHR → anchor around 7.73–7.74.  
Moderate:  
• Finnish unemployment ticked up, fiscal tightening – could shave a few hundredths off average score (historical elasticity ≈-0.03 per 1 pp jobless rise).  
Weak:  
• Articles on sauna tourism, visa-free travel, Olympic hockey – feel-good but tenuously linked to survey answers.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to expected publication of the 2026 report (with the 2025 annual table): ~25 days. Halving/doubling the horizon would barely change the forecast – the underlying Gallup 2025 polling is finished; only publication risk and small data-revision risk remain.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate (2016-24) mean ≈ 7.78, σ≈0.06. Reliable 2025 press-quotations already point to 7.736, i.e., ~0.04 below 2024. Nothing in late-2025 macro or social news suggests a revision up or down of more than ±0.03. I therefore nudge the whole distribution down by ~0.025 and tighten it slightly (most variance now is sampling ± rounding).

Distribution calibration
10th  ≈ µ – 1.4σ, 90th ≈ µ + 1.3σ with σ≈0.08 gives realistic tails while allowing for odd survey noise or a last-minute data correction.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Finland’s 2025 annual Cantril-ladder score in the World Happiness Report, 0-10 scale, to be published March 2026.  
2. Outside-view distribution centred 7.76 (10th 7.56, 90th 7.90).  
3. Implied median 7.76, mean ~7.75 – consistent with slight drift below long-run mean.  
4. Key evidence: (i) BBC/Slate 7.736 figure; (ii) WHR range 7.66–7.89 since 2016; (iii) unemployment rise to 10 %; (iv) no methodological change signalled.  
5. Blind-spot: WHR switches from “annual” back to “three-year” column without warning, pushing value to 7.74 yet resolution interprets it differently → would narrow distribution even more.  
6. Status-quo pull: Finland almost always lands in 7.7s; kept central.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units plain numbers (not scientific).
