Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Wikipedia – International Day of Happiness (2013-2026).  Factual, but only tells us the WHR is released every 20 March.  No quantitative data; low relevance.  
2. CNBC, 20 Mar 2024.  News outlet quoting the 2024 WHR (three-year average 2021-23).  Gives Finland’s ladder score 7.741 and keeps #1.  Good factual reliability; dated one report ago.  
3. TheGlobalEconomy.com, accessed Feb 2026.  Data scraper pulling WHR numbers; lists 2025 Finland value 7.74.  The site reproduces WHR tables almost verbatim, so the figure is probably the WHR single-year estimate already in the public data portal, even though the formal 2026 report is not out yet.  Medium quality (occasionally rounding differences).  
4. SWI swissinfo.ch, 20 Mar 2025.  Announces Finland #1 for the 8th year; no numeric score.  Factual but only ranking.  
5. Gallup “State of the World’s Emotional Health”, 2024.  Macro trends; no Finland-specific ladder data.  Low direct relevance.  
6. Goodnet, 24 Mar 2025.  Similar to #4.  Ranking, no score.  
7. Mental Floss, 20 Mar 2025.  Gives Finland score 7.736, explicitly clarifying it is the three-year average.  Useful cross-check.  
8. Agent report (2026).  Collates WHR portal numbers 2013-2025, highlights high (7.889 in 2020) and low (7.660 in 2016) and notes a gentle drift down to 7.736 (2025 three-year).  It also points out the single-year series range is tight (≈0.23) and that the 2025 three-year average dropped by 0.045 from the previous year.

Factual signal for the quantity of interest – the single-year 2024 figure and the provisional single-year 2025 figure – comes only from two places: (i) WHR data portal as relayed by TheGlobalEconomy (7.74 for 2025), and (ii) past official WHR tables for 2013-2024.  Everything else is context.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Finland’s own single-year ladder scores 2013-2024 (12 observations).  
• Nordic countries’ single-year ladder scores (≥60 observations across 5 countries).  
• Global top-10 countries’ scores (≈120 obs).  

The outcome is a continuous, country-specific statistic that is remarkably stable year-to-year; the best reference class is therefore “Finland’s own year-to-year variation”.  That keeps culture, poll response style, and sampling frame constant.  Std-dev (2013-2024) ≈ 0.07.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are 25 days before the 2026 WHR release (expected 20 Mar 2026).  So the target value – the Gallup survey year 2025 – is already locked in; only publication remains.  Historically there have been no ex-post revisions > 0.02 points once the data appear in the portal.  Hence almost the entire uncertainty is statistical sampling noise plus a small risk of methodological change.

(d) Justification (outside view)  
• Base rate: mean of Finland’s single-year scores 2016-2024 = 7.80.  
• Drift: Since the 2020 peak (7.889) the series has slipped by ~0.03 pt/year.  Extrapolating one more year suggests 7.76–7.78.  
• Early indicator: TheGlobalEconomy portal already shows 7.74.  That is consistent with the downward trend and with the three-year average 7.736 published in Mar 2025 (because the 2025 three-year average weights 2023, 2024, 2025 single-year values; if 2025≈7.74 the arithmetic works).  
• Method change risk: very low but non-zero (past changes in 2012, 2016 nudged values by ≤0.05).  
• Tail risks: a major economic shock or survey glitch could move the score by ±0.15, but that has never happened in a single year in the Nordic set.  I assign about a 5 % chance to ≥ 0.10 move in either direction.

Outside view calibration:
I anchor the mean at 7.74 and model uncertainty with σ ≈ 0.07, then widen the tails 15 % to admit unknown unknowns.  Mapping a (slightly-inflated) normal to percentiles:

10th ≈ µ – 1.28 σ_adj = 7.65  
20th ≈ 7.68  
40th ≈ 7.72  
60th ≈ 7.76  
80th ≈ 7.80  
90th ≈ µ + 1.28 σ_adj = 7.84  

These are strictly increasing, sit well within historical bounds (7.39–7.889), and place only 4–5 % probability below 7.60 or above 7.85, matching the observed rarity of big jumps.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7.65  
Percentile 20: 7.68  
Percentile 40: 7.72  
Percentile 60: 7.76  
Percentile 80: 7.80  
Percentile 90: 7.84
