**Forecasting Finland's Happiness Score**

I need to predict Finland's average happiness score for 2025, even though the data isn't published yet. As of now, I’m looking at the scores from previous years, assessing a slight downward trend from a peak in 2020. The scores range from about 7.39 to 7.89. For a rough estimate, I might use a distribution mean of 7.74 while considering a potentially stabilized score. I should aim to provide percentiles, with a lower bound of 7.5 and an upper of 8.0.**Analyzing Finland’s Happiness Forecast**

I see that some sources estimate Finland's happiness score for 2025 to be 7.74, which I might treat as a baseline. I’m considering the historical standard deviation to be around 0.07, leading to a normal distribution with this mean.

Given potential external factors like recession or conflict, I'll widen the tails. Using this, I could estimate percentiles: 10th at 7.65, 20th at 7.68, and so on, while recommending bounds between 7.5 and 8.0. I need to evaluate the sources for accuracy as I finalize my analysis.
