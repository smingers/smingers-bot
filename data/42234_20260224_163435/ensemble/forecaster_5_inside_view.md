Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological & quality)
• BBC/AP/WBAL/UPI/Slate (Mar & Aug 2025). Main fact: Finland again #1; quote a score of 7.736.  The press pieces are reputable and date-stamped soon after the 2025 World Happiness Report.  They clearly state the figure refers to the report and is therefore trustworthy, but most acknowledge it is the 3-year average, not the single-year number used for resolution.  Quality: high, but metric mismatch → moderate evidential weight.

• Reuters-syndicated “Finland clings to happiness crown” (Nov 2025; RTE & The Star). Highlights recession, 10 % jobless rate, welfare cuts.  Quality: high, primary interviews & official macro data.  Relevant as a possible downward pressure but causal link between GDP/unemployment and ladder score is empirically weak in Finland, so evidential weight: weak-to-moderate.

• IBTimes (07 Feb 2026). Mentions the 2026 WHR and gives Finland’s score as 7.74.  No embargo lifts prior to 20 Mar, so this is probably a press-release draft repeating the 3-year average.  Still, it places the 3-year figure almost identical to 2025’s (7.736 → 7.74).  Quality: medium; timing suggests “soft” information but not implausible.  Moderate evidential weight.

• AskNews (Feb 2026) macro snippets: small fall in unemployment to 10.3 %, cultural events, tourism, sport.  Mostly anecdotal with no demonstrated influence on Gallup life-evaluation scores.  Evidential weight: weak.

2. Evidence analysis (grading)
Strong: none (no leak of the actual 2025 single-year number).
Moderate:
  – Consistent 3-year average figures (7.736 in 2025 → 7.74 in 2026) indicate stability, bounding the likely 2025 single-year score roughly within ±0.12 of 7.74.
  – Ten-year Finnish annual scores span 7.66–7.89 with σ≈0.08; no structural breaks.  (Historical pattern)
Weak:
  – 2025–26 macro gloom and rising youth unemployment could shave a few hundredths off the score but Finland has weathered past recessions with minimal ladder movement.
  – Anecdotes about sauna-tourism or winter-sports success, visa-free travel etc.

3. Timeframe analysis
Outcome due ~25 days (by 20 Mar 2026).  If the horizon were halved (≈12 days) very little new Gallup data could surface, so uncertainty would shrink perhaps 5 %.  If doubled (≈50 days) the 2026 report will already be public and uncertainty collapses to ~0.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base (Finland 2015-2024 single-year series): mean 7.77, σ 0.08.
Downward drift since the 2020 peak ≈-0.02 / yr → subtract 0.02 → 7.75.
The 2025 three-year average (7.736) sits 0.014 below this mean and constrains the triple (2023, 2024, 2025).  With the latest known single-year 2024 = 7.781, simple algebra suggests 2025 must be ≈7.64–7.73 unless the still-unknown 2023 number was anomalously low or high.  Given that large swings (> 0.15) have never occurred, a point estimate around 7.73 with σ≈0.07 looks reasonable.  Macro head-winds nudge the centre down another ~0.01.

Distribution calibration
I assume an approximately normal shape centred on 7.74 with σ=0.07, then round to two decimals and widen tails slightly for unknown-unknowns.

Checklist:
1. Target: Finland’s 2025 annual happiness score (0–10, Cantril ladder) as published in the 2026 World Happiness Report.
2. Base distribution anchored to 2015-24 Finnish single-year scores.
3. Implied median ≈7.75; mean ≈7.74; consistent with rationale.
4. Key evidence: (i) 2025 3-yr average 7.736; (ii) historical σ≈0.08; (iii) slight downward trend; (iv) no structural shocks.
5. Blind-spot: Gallup sampling glitch or methodology change pushes score < 7.60 (downside).
6. Status-quo bias: Finland usually moves < ±0.10 yr-to-yr – reinforce modest spread.
7. Percentiles monotone & in correct units.
