**Forecasting Finland's Happiness Score**

I need to create a professional response about forecasting Finland's average happiness score for the 2026 report, which reflects data from 2025. Today's date is February 24, 2026, and the report is expected on March 20, 2026. Current articles suggest a three-year average score of 7.736. Based on trends, it seems the scores are slightly declining, perhaps by 0.02 each year. My estimate for Finland's score remains stable but slightly lower than in previous years.**Analyzing Finland's Happiness Scores**

I'm working on deriving Finland's 2025 happiness score from previous three-year averages. I need to clarify that the 2024 report's average score is likely 7.741, while the 2025 average is around 7.736. It looks like I have calculated a small decrease, indicating that the 2024 score of 7.781 corresponds to data from 2023. This means I can use it to predict 2025 scores, even with some economic concerns lingering from Gallup surveys.**Refining Finland's Happiness Score Estimates**

It seems the 2023 annual score is lower than I originally thought, indicating some uncertainty in our dataset. However, the 2024 score is likely around 7.781. Looking at older data, I have numbers like 7.842 for 2021 and 7.821 for 2022. While there's confusion around the 2023 numbers, I need to keep a median of around 7.73, considering economic stagnation. I can refine my distribution estimates for scores, aiming for values like 7.62 at the 10th percentile and 7.83 at the 90th. Now, I can move forward with crafting my analysis.
