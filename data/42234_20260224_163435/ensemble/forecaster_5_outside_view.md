Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Wikipedia – International Day of Happiness (2013-2026).  Factual, but only about the report-release date (≈ 20 March each year). No numerical data; low direct forecasting value.  
2. CNBC, 20 Mar 2024.  Reports Finland’s 2024 WHR score as 7.741 and repeats standard explanations (social trust, welfare state). Credible business press using the official report; good timeliness.  
3. TheGlobalEconomy.com, accessed 2025.  Gives a 7.74 “latest value (2025)”. The site simply re-publishes WHR data; methodology is opaque but usually mirrors the WHR data portal within ±0.005. Medium quality.  
4. SWI swissinfo.ch, 20 Mar 2025.  Confirms Finland kept rank #1, no score. Reliable Swiss public-service outlet; limited numeric usefulness.  
5. Gallup “State of the World’s Emotional Health” (2024).  Conceptually adjacent (Gallup supplies WHR raw data) but contains no Finland-specific ladder scores. Low relevance.  
6. Goodnet, 24 Mar 2025.  As #4—rank, no score; popular science site, modest reliability.  
7. Mental Floss, 20 Mar 2025.  Quotes Finland’s three-year-average score of 7.736. Clearly states this is not the annual figure; useful as a cross-check.  
8. Agent report (2026-02-24).  Aggregates WHR portal numbers 2013-2024 and triangulates that the single-year 2025 score must be close to 7.74 because the 2025 three-year average dropped by ≈0.045 from the prior year. Reasonable internal logic; cites primary WHR portal; high quality.

Factual nuggets extracted:  
• Confirmed annual scores on the WHR portal: 2013 = 7.39 (min), 2016 = 7.660, 2020 = 7.889 (max), 2024 = 7.781.  
• Unofficial but likely accurate single-year 2025 score ≈ 7.74.  
• Year-to-year range over the last decade: 7.66 – 7.89 (spread 0.23). Standard deviation ≈ 0.08–0.10.  
No expert opinion points to a structural shock that would move 2025 far outside this historical band.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Options considered:  
i. Finland’s own annual ladder scores 2005-2024 (n≈20).  
ii. All Nordic countries’ annual scores 2005-2024 (n≈100).  
iii. All top-10 WHR countries’ scores 2005-2024.  

Because Finland’s variance is already low and culturally specific factors matter more than cross-country averages, reference class (i) is the tightest and least noise-prone. I use the Finland-only series.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until publication of the 2026 report: ~25.  The WHR will report the 2025 annual number already locked in by Gallup survey work finished months ago; the remaining uncertainty is purely our observational error. Historically, one-year jumps for Finland have stayed within ±0.12 (1½ s.d.) of the preceding year. A mild downward drift (–0.01 to –0.03 per year) has been visible since the 2020 peak.

(d) Justification for the outside view  
Base-rate mean: simple average of the last ten single-year scores (2015-2024) = 7.77.  
Trend adjustment: linear-fit decline of ~0.02 per year ⇒ subtract 0.02 for 2025 → 7.75.  
Cross-check: TheGlobalEconomy.com already shows 7.74; three-year average back-calculation implies an annual ≈ 7.74. I therefore anchor the median around 7.75.  
Uncertainty: historical σ ≈ 0.08.  80 % of observations lie within ±1 σ, 90 % within ±1.5 σ → set 10th/90th roughly ±0.12 around the median. I widen another 0.01 for “unknown unknowns” (e.g., sampling noise, methodological tweak), giving a 10th–90th spread of 0.26.

Outside view calibration:

Assume a normal‐ish distribution centred on 7.75 with σ≈0.08.  
• 10th ≈ μ – 1.3 σ ≈ 7.75 – 0.10 = 7.65  
• 20th ≈ μ – 1.0 σ ≈ 7.67–7.68  
• 40th ≈ μ – 0.4 σ ≈ 7.72–7.73  
• 60th ≈ μ + 0.3 σ ≈ 7.77  
• 80th ≈ μ + 0.8 σ ≈ 7.81  
• 90th ≈ μ + 1.1 σ ≈ 7.84  

Historical surprises larger than ±0.15 have never occurred, so the above tails already allow slightly more room than precedent.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7.65  
Percentile 20: 7.68  
Percentile 40: 7.73  
Percentile 60: 7.77  
Percentile 80: 7.81  
Percentile 90: 7.84
