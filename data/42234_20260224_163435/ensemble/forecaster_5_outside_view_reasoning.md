**Analyzing happiness forecast**

I need to predict Finland's score for the 2026 World Happiness Report based on its 2025 annual score. Historical data and rankings will help me identify trends and contexts around happiness. I'll analyze multiple sources and determine a distribution using percentiles like 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 90 to map out predictions. It’s important to clarify that I'm aiming for the score reflecting 2025 data, published in March 2026. Let's get started!**Summarizing Finland's happiness score**

I'm reviewing Finland's average annual score, which is reported as 7.781 for 2024, although I think that could refer to a single-year figure. Historical scores show 7.889 in 2020 and 7.660 in 2016. Sources like TheGlobalEconomy.com mention a 2025 figure of 7.74, indicating some numbers might be approximations. For an outside view, I’ll analyze historical data from 2005-2024, considering approximately 20 scores. I’ll create percentiles and manage sources, evaluating their reliability while focusing on Finland's trends. Let’s put that analysis together!**Creating prediction distribution**

I need to determine the distribution values for the "Outside View Prediction" based on data from the preceding year, noting that the variation is small. I’ll use a time frame that reflects recently available data. It’s crucial that the values are strictly increasing, so I'll set the increment to 0.03. I think this approach will help produce a clear and accurate set of predictions. Let’s get crafting on those values!
