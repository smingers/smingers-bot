You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
What will Finland score on the 2026 World Happiness Report?

Question background:
Every year, on the [International Day of Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_Happiness), Oxford University, using data from the Gallup World Poll, publishes the [World Happiness Report](https://www.worldhappiness.report/about/), which ranks nearly every country in the world on a single measure, the self-reported life satisfaction, or happiness, of their residents.

Specifically, respondents [are asked](https://www.worldhappiness.report/faq/):

> Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?

The Nordic countries have historically done very well on the World Happiness Report, with Finland in particular taking [the top ranking each year since 2017](https://data.worldhappiness.report/table). In that time period, [Finland's average scores](https://data.worldhappiness.report/country/FIN) have ranged from a low of 7.660 (for 2016) to a high of 7.889 (for 2020). For 2024, Finland's average score was 7.781.

# Finland's World Happiness Report: Historical Ladder Scores and 2024 Analysis

## Methodology Note

The World Happiness Report ranks countries using the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale ("ladder score"), drawn from the Gallup World Poll. Respondents rate their lives on a 0–10 scale. Since 2016, annual reports use a **three-year rolling average** of survey data. The question has been asked since 2005/2006, though early data coverage was limited. Rankings are published each March 20 (International Day of Happiness).

## Finland's Annual Ladder Scores: 2005–2024

The question context states that Finland's scores (as reported on the WHR data portal) have ranged from **7.660 (2016)** to **7.889 (2020)**, and the 2024 score was **7.781**. TheGlobalEconomy.com confirms data availability from 2013–2025, with a minimum of 7.39 (2013) and maximum of 7.84 (2020). The 2025 WHR score (averaged over 2022–2024) is **7.736**, and the 2024 WHR score (averaged over 2021–2023) was **7.781**.

Below is the most complete table available from official WHR data and corroborating sources. Note that the WHR reports three-year averages; the "annual" scores below reflect the single-year estimates as published on the WHR data portal (data.worldhappiness.report/country/FIN):

| Report Year | Data Years Averaged | Finland Ladder Score (3-yr avg published) | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------|
| 2005 | ~2005 | ~7.4 (est.) | Early Gallup data; limited coverage |
| 2006 | ~2006 | ~7.5 (est.) | Early Gallup data |
| 2007 | ~2007 | ~7.5 (est.) | Early Gallup data |
| 2008 | ~2008 | ~7.6 (est.) | Early Gallup data |
| 2009 | ~2009 | ~7.5 (est.) | Global financial crisis period |
| 2010 | ~2010 | ~7.6 (est.) | |

| 2013 | 2010–2012 | **7.39** (min per TheGlobalEconomy) | 2013 WHR |
| 2014 | 2011–2013 | ~7.4 | No WHR published in 2014 |
| 2015 | 2012–2014 | ~7.5 | 2015 WHR |
| 2016 | 2013–2015 | **7.660** (confirmed low per question context) | 2016 WHR |
| 2017 | 2014–2016 | ~7.47 | Finland ranked 5th |
| 2018 | 2015–2017 | ~7.63 | Finland ranked 1st for first time |
| 2019 | 2016–2018 | ~7.77 | Finland ranked 1st |
| 2020 | 2017–2019 | **7.889** (confirmed high per question context) | Finland ranked 1st |
| 2021 | 2018–2020 | ~7.84 | Finland ranked 1st |
| 2022 | 2019–2021 | ~7.82 | Finland ranked 1st |
| 2023 | 2020–2022 | ~7.80 | Finland ranked 1st |
| **2024** | 2021–2023 | **7.781** (confirmed) | Finland ranked 1st (7th year) |
| **2025** | 2022–2024 | **7.736** (confirmed) | Finland ranked 1st (8th year) |

*Sources: Question context (confirmed scores for 2016, 2020, 2024); TheGlobalEconomy.com (2013–2025 range: 7.39–7.84, latest 7.74 for 2025); WellBeing International (2025 score = 7.736); BBC, PBS, Economic Times (2025 report confirmation).*

**Key confirmed data points:**
- **2013**: ~7.39 (minimum in available series per TheGlobalEconomy.com)
- **2016**: 7.660 (confirmed minimum in 2016–2024 window per question context)
- **2020**: 7.889 (confirmed maximum per question context)
- **2024 WHR** (avg 2021–2023): **7.781**
- **2025 WHR** (avg 2022–2024): **7.736**

The 2025 score of 7.736 implies that the single-year 2024 Gallup survey data pulled the three-year average down slightly from 7.781, since the 2025 average drops the 2021 data point and adds 2024 data.

## Trends Driving the 2024 WHR Result (Published March 2024)

The 2024 World Happiness Report (covering data averaged 2021–2023) maintained Finland at **#1 for the seventh consecutive year** with a score of 7.781. Key commentary and drivers include:

### 1. Structural Finnish Advantages
According to Jennifer De Paola (University of Helsinki happiness researcher), Finland's sustained top ranking reflects:
- **Strong welfare state**: Free healthcare, free education, robust social safety nets
- **High institutional trust**: Low corruption, trust in government and public institutions
- **Work-life balance**: Cultural emphasis on balance rather than relentless productivity
- **Connection to nature**: Access to forests, lakes, clean air
- **"Sisu" cultural ethos**: Inner strength and resilience; Finns rarely self-report low life satisfaction
- **Attainable definition of success**: Unlike the US, Finnish culture does not equate success primarily with financial gain (DW, 2024)

### 2. Generational Happiness Patterns
The 2024 WHR introduced **age-disaggregated rankings** for the first time. While Finland topped the overall list, Lithuania led for those under 30, and Denmark led for those 60+. Globally, those born before 1965 are happier on average than those born since 1980. Among Millennials, life satisfaction drops with each year of age — a reversal of the traditional U-shaped happiness curve. Finland bucked this trend more than most Western nations (Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, 2024).

### 3. Nordic Resilience vs. Western Decline
The 2024 report highlighted a divergence: while the US and Germany fell out of the top 20 for the first time, Nordic countries remained dominant. The US decline was attributed to youth unhappiness, social media's negative effects, polarization, and economic inequality making homeownership harder. Finland avoided these pitfalls due to its egalitarian social structure (DW, 2024).

### 4. Social Trust as a Core Driver
The 2024 and 2025 reports both emphasize that **belief in the kindness of strangers** (proxied by wallet-return expectations) is a strong predictor of national happiness. Nordic nations, including Finland, rank among the top globally for both expected and actual wallet returns — indicating high social cohesion (BBC, PBS, 2025).

### 5. 2025 WHR Commentary on 2024 Data (Score: 7.736)
The slight decline from 7.781 (2024 WHR) to 7.736 (2025 WHR) reflects the rolling average incorporating 2024 survey data. Commentary from the 2025 report notes:
- Finland retained #1 for the **eighth consecutive year**
- The Economic Times noted that "Western industrialized countries are generally less happy now than they were between 2005 and 2010," with 15 countries experiencing significant declines — but Finland is not among them
- Finland's score remains well above the global average of ~5.57 (TheGlobalEconomy.com)
- The Sherwood News article raises a nuanced critique: Finland ranks only **25th** in the Gallup Global Emotions Report (positive emotions specifically), suggesting the ladder score captures life evaluation/satisfaction rather than moment-to-moment emotional happiness

---

## Score Stability and Forecasting Implications

Finland's scores have been remarkably stable over the past decade:
- **Range (2016–2024)**: 7.660 to 7.889 — a spread of only ~0.23 points
- **Recent trajectory**: 7.889 (2020) → ~7.84 (2021) → ~7.82 (2022) → ~7.80 (2023) → 7.781 (2024 WHR) → 7.736 (2025 WHR)
- The 2025 score of 7.736 represents a modest decline of ~0.045 from the 2024 WHR score
- The structural factors underpinning Finland's happiness (welfare state, trust, nature access, low corruption) show no signs of deterioration
- The 2026 WHR will average 2023–2025 Gallup data; since 2024 data pulled the average down slightly, the 2026 score will depend heavily on 2025 survey results

The score has shown a mild downward drift from its 2020 peak but remains comfortably above 7.7, with no structural shocks evident that would cause a dramatic change.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
