The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?\n\nThe Nordic countries have historically done very well on the World Happiness Report, with Finland in particular taking [the top ranking each year since 2017](https://data.worldhappiness.report/table). In that time period, [Finland's average scores](https://data.worldhappiness.report/country/FIN) have ranged from a low of 7.660 (for 2016) to a high of 7.889 (for 2020). For 2024, Finland's average score was 7.781.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41954,\"question_id\":41693}}`",

This question will resolve according to the \"annual\" figure for 2025.\n\nIf data for 2025 has not been published before May 1, 2026, this question will be annulled.\n\n***\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41954) which opened on 2026-02-18 17:00:00.
