Analysis:
To estimate Finland’s 2025 average life-evaluation score (the number that will appear in the 2026 World Happiness Report) we need any early-released Gallup World Poll figures, leaks, academic previews, or Finnish media reporting on preliminary results. Because the Gallup data sometimes surfaces in press releases, government briefings, or scholarly blogs before the formal report, I want searches that combine “Finland”, “2025”, and survey terms such as “ladder score”, “life evaluation”, or “Gallup World Poll”. Current-year Finnish outlets and Nordic economic think-tank commentary are the most likely sources. Therefore I’ll use:

• A broad Google web search for any site posting the raw 2025 ladder score.
• A Google News search to catch fresh journalistic pieces published in the last few days or weeks.
• An AskNews natural-language query for a targeted retrieval of any February 2026 discussions or leaks about Finland’s 2025 Gallup data.
