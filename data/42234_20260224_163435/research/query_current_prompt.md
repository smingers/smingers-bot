The forecasting question is:
What will Finland score on the 2026 World Happiness Report?

Question background:
Every year, on the [International Day of Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_Happiness), Oxford University, using data from the Gallup World Poll, publishes the [World Happiness Report](https://www.worldhappiness.report/about/), which ranks nearly every country in the world on a single measure, the self-reported life satisfaction, or happiness, of their residents.

Specifically, respondents [are asked](https://www.worldhappiness.report/faq/):

> Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?

The Nordic countries have historically done very well on the World Happiness Report, with Finland in particular taking [the top ranking each year since 2017](https://data.worldhappiness.report/table). In that time period, [Finland's average scores](https://data.worldhappiness.report/country/FIN) have ranged from a low of 7.660 (for 2016) to a high of 7.889 (for 2020). For 2024, Finland's average score was 7.781.
