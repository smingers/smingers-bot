Analysis:
To forecast Finland’s 2025 “life-ladder” score (to be published in the 2026 World Happiness Report) the key outside-view information is Finland’s own historical annual scores, the variance of those scores, and any recent movement in Gallup’s underlying 2023–25 survey waves that will feed next year’s estimate.  Therefore I first need a clean time series of Finland’s annual WHR scores (ideally 2005-2024) and any discussion of why the 2024 value moved.  Second, I want news coverage or expert commentary since the 2024 report that hints at how 2024-2025 economic, social, or political developments may influence Finns’ self-reported wellbeing.  Finally, an Agent query can ask directly for the full historical series plus statistical properties, saving manual compilation.
