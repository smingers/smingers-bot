This surge in visa-free travel is part of Finland's broader passport strength, which already grants access to over 160 countries and territories through visa-free or visa-on-arrival agreements. Finland\u2019s inclusion in the Schengen Area ensures visa-free entry to Spain and other Schengen countries for up to 90 days.

In contrast, Kuwait ranks last for the seventh consecutive year despite high income, due to extreme heat (over 45\u00b0C in summer), poor social integration, limited career advancement, and low quality of life. South Korea, while technologically advanced and culturally influential, ranks poorly for expats due to 'ppalli ppalli' (hurry hurry) culture, long work hours, mandatory after-work socializing, language barriers, and difficulty forming lasting social connections. The report reveals that happiness is not driven solely by wealth but by community, equality, and human connection.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 02:30 PM\nSource:[Travelbinger](https://travelbinger.com/think-before-you-move-3-countries-that-boost-happiness-and-those-that-challenge-it/)\n\n**Man compares 'happiest country in world' to Britain and there's a big difference**\nFinland was ranked the world's happiest country for the eighth consecutive year in the 2025 UN-sponsored World Happiness Report, with an average life evaluation score of 7.736, followed by Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden. The report, released on the International Day of Happiness, surveyed global respondents on a 0\u201310 scale, attributing Finland\u2019s success to access to nature, a strong welfare system, and high social trust. In contrast, the UK dropped to 23rd place, with researchers citing rising political polarization and declining social trust as contributing factors. Charlotte Erika, a dual British-Finnish citizen living in England, noted that Finns exhibit a stronger sense of social cohesion, possibly due to lower population density and a societal value system that emphasizes community, stating, 'People are more valued than in the UK probably because there are less of them than in the UK.' She also highlighted Finland\u2019s world-class education and childcare systems, though cautioned that happiness metrics may not fully reflect everyday life. Other British commenters reflected on cultural norms, with one noting that 'the problem with the UK is that we already have low expectations, yet we somehow still end up disappointed,' and another observing that Britons tend to understate happiness to avoid appearing boastful, saying, 'Even when we're happy we'll just say things are OK.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2025 03:22 PM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/2149863/man-compares-happiest-country-world)\n\n**Finland clings to happiness crown as economic gloom deepens**\nFinland has retained its title as the world's happiest country for the eighth consecutive year in the 2025 World Happiness Report, despite deepening economic challenges. The country faces economic stagnation, rising unemployment\u2014reaching nearly 10% nationally and 21.2% among 15 to 24-year-olds\u2014and a projected 0.3% GDP growth, down from 0.4% in 2024. The Bank of Finland forecasts a budget deficit exceeding the EU\u2019s 3% threshold for three consecutive years, potentially triggering an 'Excessive Deficit Procedure' by the EU. The decline in Finland\u2019s export-driven economy, following Nokia\u2019s collapse in 2014 and ongoing sanctions on Russia affecting trade and tourism, has intensified fiscal strain. Public finances are under pressure due to an aging population, prompting cuts to unemployment benefits, though pensions\u2014described as 'almost sacred'\u2014remain untouched. Juho-Pekka Palomaa, a 33-year-old unemployed former video producer who has been jobless for 1,000 days, expressed gratitude for Finland\u2019s social safety net but frustration over his inability to change his situation, highlighting the disconnect between national happiness and individual hardship. Experts attribute Finland\u2019s high happiness ranking to its generous welfare state, now being scaled back amid fiscal constraints.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2025/11/26/finland-clings-to-happiness-crown-as-economic-gloom-deepens)\n\n**Finland clings to happiness crown as economic gloom grows**\nFinland remains the world's happiest country for the eighth consecutive year in the 2025 World Happiness Report, despite facing severe economic challenges including stagnation, rising unemployment, and strained public finances. Unemployment reached 10.3% in October\u2014its highest level in at least 15 years\u2014and soared to 22.4% among 15- to 24-year-olds. The Bank of Finland forecasts economic growth of only 0.3% for 2025, down from 0.4% in 2024. The European Commission may initiate an 'Excessive Deficit Procedure' due to projected budget deficits exceeding the EU\u2019s 3% threshold for three consecutive years. In response, the right-wing coalition government has cut unemployment and housing benefits and reduced some medical services, while making dismissals easier to encourage hiring. Minister of Employment Matias Marttinen acknowledged the high jobless rate as 'an awful situation' but defended austerity as necessary to stabilize public debt. Critics, including Lauri Holappa of the Finnish Centre for New Economic Analysis, argue that fiscal consolidation may worsen public debt. Despite these hardships, Finns' reported happiness remains stable, attributed to resilience, strong social support, and the ability to 'deal collaboratively and constructively in bad times,' according to emeritus professor John Helliwell. One unemployed resident, 33-year-old Juho-Pekka Palomaa, who has been jobless for 1,000 days, maintained his spirits through community activities like a volunteer-run sauna on the Baltic Sea, where he found equality and dignity. He marked his milestone with a 'bring-your-own-food' protest at parliament, stating, 'I decided that this is my moment. I got to seize the moment and do something about it.' Gallup survey data for 2026 shows no significant decline in Finns\u2019 self-reported happiness, underscoring that well-being is influenced more by social and psychological factors than economic conditions alone.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 09:34 AM\nSource:[RTE.ie](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1125/1545716-finland-clings-to-happiness-crown-as-economic-gloom-grows/)\n\n**6 Happiest Countries to Reside In (And 3 You May Want to Avoid)**\nThe 2024 World Happiness Report, based on Gallup polling data from 143 countries, ranks Finland as the world\u2019s happiest country with a score of 7.741, marking its seventh consecutive year at the top. Finland's success is attributed to strong social support, low corruption, high freedom of choice, and a cultural emphasis on collective wellbeing. Denmark ranks second with a score of 7.583, driven by high equality, strong social welfare systems, and high taxes balanced by free healthcare, education, and pensions. Iceland ranks third with 7.525, leading in social support and generosity, and is particularly popular among younger residents. The Netherlands ranks sixth with 7.319, excelling in generosity and GDP, and enjoying high levels of individual autonomy and social tolerance. Norway ranks seventh with 7.302, benefiting from universal healthcare, free college tuition, a 27-hour workweek, low crime, and a sovereign wealth fund. Australia rounds out the top 10 with a score of 7.234, standing out as one of only two top-10 countries with a population over 15 million, though it faces challenges in youth happiness. At the bottom, Afghanistan ranks 143rd with a score of 1.721, due to war, political instability, low GDP, and the Taliban takeover. Lebanon ranks second-to-last with 2.707, suffering from economic collapse, currency devaluation, and political paralysis. Sierra Leone ranks fifth from the bottom with 3.245, facing poverty, poor healthcare, and limited education. The report highlights that happiness is not solely tied to economic prosperity but is strongly linked to social safety nets, low corruption, work-life balance, and collective wellbeing.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 10:15 AM\nSource:[Travelbinger](https://travelbinger.com/6-happiest-countries-to-reside-in-and-3-you-may-want-to-avoid/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
