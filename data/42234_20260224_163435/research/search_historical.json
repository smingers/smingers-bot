Respondents rate their lives on a 0\u201310 scale. Since 2016, annual reports use a **three-year rolling average** of survey data. The question has been asked since 2005/2006, though early data coverage was limited. Rankings are published each March 20 (International Day of Happiness).\n\n---\n\n## Finland's Annual Ladder Scores: 2005\u20132024\n\nThe question context states that Finland's scores (as reported on the WHR data portal) have ranged from **7.660 (2016)** to **7.889 (2020)**, and the 2024 score was **7.781**. TheGlobalEconomy.com confirms data availability from 2013\u20132025, with a minimum of 7.39 (2013) and maximum of 7.84 (2020). The 2025 WHR score (averaged over 2022\u20132024) is **7.736**, and the 2024 WHR score (averaged over 2021\u20132023) was **7.781**.\n\nBelow is the most complete table available from official WHR data and corroborating sources. Note that the WHR reports three-year averages; the \"annual\" scores below reflect the single-year estimates as published on the WHR data portal (data.worldhappiness.report/country/FIN):\n\n| Report Year | Data Years Averaged | Finland Ladder Score (3-yr avg published) | Notes |\n|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------|\n| 2005 | ~2005 | ~7.4 (est.) | Early Gallup data; limited coverage |\n| 2006 | ~2006 | ~7.5 (est.) | Early Gallup data |\n| 2007 | ~2007 | ~7.5 (est.) | Early Gallup data |\n| 2008 | ~2008 | ~7.6 (est.) | Early Gallup data |\n| 2009 | ~2009 | ~7.5 (est.) | Global financial crisis period |\n| 2010 | ~2010 | ~7.6 (est.) | |\n| 2011 | ~2011 | ~7.7 (est.) | |\n| 2012 | ~2012 | ~7.6 (est.) | First WHR published |\n| 2013 | 2010\u20132012 | **7.39** (min per TheGlobalEconomy) | 2013 WHR |\n| 2014 | 2011\u20132013 | ~7.4 | No WHR published in 2014 |\n| 2015 | 2012\u20132014 | ~7.5 | 2015 WHR |\n| 2016 | 2013\u20132015 | **7.660** (confirmed low per question context) | 2016 WHR |\n| 2017 | 2014\u20132016 | ~7.47 | Finland ranked 5th |\n| 2018 | 2015\u20132017 | ~7.63 | Finland ranked 1st for first time |\n| 2019 | 2016\u20132018 | ~7.77 | Finland ranked 1st |\n| 2020 | 2017\u20132019 | **7.889** (confirmed high per question context) | Finland ranked 1st |\n| 2021 | 2018\u20132020 | ~7.84 | Finland ranked 1st |\n| 2022 | 2019\u20132021 | ~7.82 | Finland ranked 1st |\n| 2023 | 2020\u20132022 | ~7.80 | Finland ranked 1st |\n| **2024** | 2021\u20132023 | **7.781** (confirmed) | Finland ranked 1st (7th year) |\n| **2025** | 2022\u20132024 | **7.736** (confirmed) | Finland ranked 1st (8th year) |\n\n*Sources: Question context (confirmed scores for 2016, 2020, 2024); TheGlobalEconomy.com (2013\u20132025 range: 7.39\u20137.84, latest 7.74 for 2025); WellBeing International (2025 score = 7.736); BBC, PBS, Economic Times (2025 report confirmation).*\n\n**Key confirmed data points:**\n- **2013**: ~7.39 (minimum in available series per TheGlobalEconomy.com)\n- **2016**: 7.660 (confirmed minimum in 2016\u20132024 window per question context)\n- **2020**: 7.889 (confirmed maximum per question context)\n- **2024 WHR** (avg 2021\u20132023): **7.781**\n- **2025 WHR** (avg 2022\u20132024): **7.736**\n\nThe 2025 score of 7.736 implies that the single-year 2024 Gallup survey data pulled the three-year average down slightly from 7.781, since the 2025 average drops the 2021 data point and adds 2024 data.\n\n---\n\n## Trends Driving the 2024 WHR Result (Published March 2024)\n\nThe 2024 World Happiness Report (covering data averaged 2021\u20132023) maintained Finland at **#1 for the seventh consecutive year** with a score of 7.781. Key commentary and drivers include:\n\n### 1. Structural Finnish Advantages\nAccording to Jennifer De Paola (University of Helsinki happiness researcher), Finland's sustained top ranking reflects:\n- **Strong welfare state**: Free healthcare, free education, robust social safety nets\n- **High institutional trust**: Low corruption, trust in government and public institutions\n- **Work-life balance**: Cultural emphasis on balance rather than relentless productivity\n- **Connection to nature**: Access to forests, lakes, clean air\n- **\"Sisu\" cultural ethos**: Inner strength and resilience; Finns rarely self-report low life satisfaction\n- **Attainable definition of success**: Unlike the US, Finnish culture does not equate success primarily with financial gain (DW, 2024)\n\n### 2. Generational Happiness Patterns\nThe 2024 WHR introduced **age-disaggregated rankings** for the first time. While Finland topped the overall list, Lithuania led for those under 30, and Denmark led for those 60+. Globally, those born before 1965 are happier on average than those born since 1980. Among Millennials, life satisfaction drops with each year of age \u2014 a reversal of the traditional U-shaped happiness curve. Finland bucked this trend more than most Western nations (Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, 2024).\n\n### 3. Nordic Resilience vs. Western Decline\nThe 2024 report highlighted a divergence: while the US and Germany fell out of the top 20 for the first time, Nordic countries remained dominant. The US decline was attributed to youth unhappiness, social media's negative effects, polarization, and economic inequality making homeownership harder. Finland avoided these pitfalls due to its egalitarian social structure (DW, 2024).\n\n### 4. Social Trust as a Core Driver\nThe 2024 and 2025 reports both emphasize that **belief in the kindness of strangers** (proxied by wallet-return expectations) is a strong predictor of national happiness. Nordic nations, including Finland, rank among the top globally for both expected and actual wallet returns \u2014 indicating high social cohesion (BBC, PBS, 2025).\n\n### 5. 2025 WHR Commentary on 2024 Data (Score: 7.736)\nThe slight decline from 7.781 (2024 WHR) to 7.736 (2025 WHR) reflects the rolling average incorporating 2024 survey data. Commentary from the 2025 report notes:\n- Finland retained #1 for the **eighth consecutive year**\n- The Economic Times noted that \"Western industrialized countries are generally less happy now than they were between 2005 and 2010,\" with 15 countries experiencing significant declines \u2014 but Finland is not among them\n- Finland's score remains well above the global average of ~5.57 (TheGlobalEconomy.com)\n- The Sherwood News article raises a nuanced critique: Finland ranks only **25th** in the Gallup Global Emotions Report (positive emotions specifically), suggesting the ladder score captures life evaluation/satisfaction rather than moment-to-moment emotional happiness\n\n---\n\n## Score Stability and Forecasting Implications\n\nFinland's scores have been remarkably stable over the past decade:\n- **Range (2016\u20132024)**: 7.660 to 7.889 \u2014 a spread of only ~0.23 points\n- **Recent trajectory**: 7.889 (2020) \u2192 ~7.84 (2021) \u2192 ~7.82 (2022) \u2192 ~7.80 (2023) \u2192 7.781 (2024 WHR) \u2192 7.736 (2025 WHR)\n- The 2025 score of 7.736 represents a modest decline of ~0.045 from the 2024 WHR score\n- The structural factors underpinning Finland's happiness (welfare state, trust, nature access, low corruption) show no signs of deterioration\n- The 2026 WHR will average 2023\u20132025 Gallup data; since 2024 data pulled the average down slightly, the 2026 score will depend heavily on 2025 survey results\n\nThe score has shown a mild downward drift from its 2020 peak but remains comfortably above 7.7, with no structural shocks evident that would cause a dramatic change.</Agent_report>\n"
