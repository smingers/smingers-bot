Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Ukrainian news source (NV.ua, Jan 15, 2026)**: States "The English Wikipedia has over 7.1 million articles" as of Wikipedia's 25th anniversary. Moderate quality regional news source. The figure "over 7.1 million" is consistent with other sources but imprecise.

2. **Exame/Portuguese article (Jan 28, 2026)**: States English Wikipedia holds "about 7 million entries" as of December 2025. Lower precision, but consistent directionally.

3. **Terra/Portuguese article (Jan 15, 2026)**: States English Wikipedia has "grown from 25,000 articles in English in 2002 to over seven million today." Imprecise but consistent.

4. **AFP/German article (Jan 3, 2026)**: States "over 7.1 million in English" as of early January 2026. AFP is a reliable wire service. This is strong corroboration that as of early 2026, English Wikipedia was at approximately 7.1 million articles.

5. **Nature article (Jan 28, 2026)**: States ~500 new English Wikipedia articles added per day. Nature is a highly credible source. This growth rate figure is the most authoritative available.

6. **Madhyamam editorial (Jan 17, 2026)**: States "over 7 million articles across more than 300 languages" — this appears to conflate all languages, not English specifically. Lower relevance.

7. **Day.Az (Jan 11, 2026)**: References Grokipedia reaching 6.09 million articles = "86% of total English Wikipedia articles," implying English Wikipedia had ~7.08 million articles as of January 11, 2026. This is an indirect but useful data point.

8. **Outside view agent report**: Provides the most critical data — live API figure of **7,073,984** as of February 21, 2026, with ~500 articles/day growth rate. This is the primary quantitative anchor.

9. **AskNews articles**: None directly address English Wikipedia article counts. They are largely irrelevant to the specific resolution criteria.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Live API figure of 7,073,984 articles as of February 21, 2026** (outside view agent report): This is the most direct, quantitative evidence. The gap to 7,145,000 is ~71,016 articles.
- **~500 articles/day growth rate** (Nature, Jan 28, 2026; corroborated by multiple sources): At this rate, only ~4,000 articles would be added in 8 days, leaving a ~67,000 article shortfall.
- **Multiple sources confirming ~7.1 million articles as of early 2026**: AFP, Ukrainian news, Day.Az inference all point to ~7.08-7.1 million as of January 2026, consistent with the API figure.

**Moderate evidence:**
- The Day.Az article (Jan 11, 2026) implies ~7.08M articles at that date, suggesting growth of ~6,000 articles over 41 days (Jan 11 to Feb 21) at ~146/day... wait, that doesn't match. Actually 7,073,984 - ~7,080,000 would suggest slight decline, which seems wrong. More likely the Day.Az calculation was approximate. The API figure is more reliable.

**Weak evidence:**
- No sources indicate any planned mass article creation event for English Wikipedia in February 2026.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **8 days** remain (Feb 21 to Mar 1, 2026).
- At ~500 articles/day: ~4,000 articles added → reaching ~7,077,984 by March 1.
- **Gap remaining**: ~7,145,000 - 7,077,984 = ~67,016 articles short.
- If the timeframe were halved (4 days): Even less possible — ~2,000 articles added, ~69,000 short.
- If the timeframe were doubled (16 days): Still ~8,000 articles added, ~63,000 short. Still impossible through normal growth.
- The math is so decisive that even doubling the timeframe doesn't change the conclusion. Only a 100x+ acceleration in article creation would resolve YES.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate of ~2% is already very low. The inside view analysis confirms this:

1. **Mathematical impossibility through normal growth**: 71,016 articles needed in 8 days at 500/day = 142 days needed. The question resolves in 8 days. This is not a close call.

2. **No evidence of extraordinary events**: No bot runs, mass article creation campaigns, or other extraordinary events are indicated in any source for English Wikipedia in this period.

3. **Historical precedent**: English Wikipedia has become more restrictive about mass bot-created stubs. The era of geographic stub bots creating millions of articles is largely over. Modern growth is organic and slow.

4. **Consistency across sources**: Multiple independent sources all confirm ~7.1 million articles as of early 2026, consistent with the API figure.

The only scenario where YES resolves is if a massive, unprecedented bot run creates ~70,000+ articles in 8 days. This is theoretically possible but has essentially no indication of occurring. I'd estimate this at ~1-2%.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view was 2.1%. The inside view analysis fully confirms this — the math is decisive, the gap is enormous relative to the timeframe, and there are no indicators of extraordinary events. If anything, the inside view slightly lowers confidence in YES because the API figure is more precise than the "over 7.1 million" approximations, and 7,073,984 is further from 7,145,000 than "over 7.1 million" might suggest.

I'll set my final probability at **2%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will English Wikipedia's "Content pages" count on Special:Statistics reach ≥7,145,000 at any point before March 1, 2026? ✓

2. **Outside view base rate**: 2.1% — rooted in mathematical impossibility of normal growth closing the gap in 8 days. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "2 out of 100 times, English Wikipedia reaches 7,145,000 articles before March 1, 2026 happens." This makes sense — only extraordinary bot events could cause this, and none are indicated. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - API figure: 7,073,984 articles as of Feb 21, 2026 (71,016 short of threshold) ✓
   - Growth rate: ~500 articles/day (Nature, multiple sources) ✓
   - 8 days remaining → ~4,000 articles added → still ~67,000 short ✓
   - No evidence of planned mass article creation events ✓

5. **Blind spot**: A large-scale bot run creating geographic or biographical stubs could theoretically add 70,000+ articles in days. This has happened historically but not recently in English Wikipedia. Probability shift: maybe +1-2%.

6. **Status quo**: Current trend continues at ~500/day → Wikipedia reaches ~7,078,000 by March 1. Status quo = NO. ✓

Probability: 2%
