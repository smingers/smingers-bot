Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Wikimedia NZ "Wikipedia Wrapped" (Dec 2024)**: Legitimate Wikimedia affiliate source. Provides editorial activity stats for 2024 but no article count data. Limited direct relevance.

2. **Diff/Wikimedia blog (May 2016)**: Official Wikimedia blog. Implies ~4.7M+ articles in May 2016. Historical baseline only.

3. **India Today (Oct 28, 2025)**: News article stating English Wikipedia "currently hosts around 7.1 million articles" as of late October 2025. Reasonable quality; the figure is approximate but consistent with growth trends.

4. **International Business Times UK (Dec 30, 2025)**: States English Wikipedia "currently hosts more than 7.1 million articles" as of December 30, 2025. This is a key data point — as of end of 2025, Wikipedia was at ~7.1M articles, below the 7,145,000 threshold.

5. **Grunge (June 2020)**: States "more than six million articles" as of June 2020. Historical baseline.

6. **Agent Report**: Most critical source. Provides:
   - Live API value as of 2026-02-21: **7,073,984 articles**
   - January 2024 baseline: 6,719,460 articles
   - 2024 growth: ~162K articles; 2025 growth: ~192K articles
   - Linear extrapolation suggests 7,145K by mid-May 2026 — *after* the March 1, 2026 deadline

The agent report's live API figure of **7,073,984** as of February 21, 2026 is the most critical data point. This is approximately **71,016 articles short** of the 7,145,000 threshold.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

- **Wikipedia daily growth rate**: The agent report states ~192K articles added in 2025, which is ~526 articles/day. The IBT article corroborates "averaging ~500 new articles daily."
- **Days remaining**: The question resolves March 1, 2026. From February 21 to March 1 is **8 days**.
- **Articles needed**: 7,145,000 - 7,073,984 = **71,016 articles** in 8 days.
- **Required daily rate**: 71,016 ÷ 8 = **~8,877 articles/day** — approximately **17x the current daily rate**.

This is clearly not achievable through normal organic growth. The reference class of "Wikipedia reaching a milestone through normal growth" strongly suggests this will NOT happen.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **8 days** remain until resolution.
- At ~500 articles/day, Wikipedia would add approximately **4,000 articles** by March 1, reaching ~7,077,984 — still ~67,000 short of 7,145,000.
- Historical Wikipedia growth has been remarkably consistent; there are no known events that caused a 17x spike in article creation over a week.
- Even during Wikipedia's fastest growth periods (early 2000s with bot-created stubs), the rate was much higher but still not 8,877/day for the English Wikipedia in recent years.

**(d) Justification**

The math is decisive. As of February 21, 2026, English Wikipedia has ~7,073,984 articles. The threshold is 7,145,000. The gap is ~71,016 articles. With 8 days remaining and a growth rate of ~500 articles/day, the expected addition is ~4,000 articles — leaving a shortfall of ~67,000. 

For resolution to YES, Wikipedia would need to experience an unprecedented 17x acceleration in article creation. This could theoretically happen if a massive bot run created hundreds of thousands of stub articles (as happened historically with geographic stubs), but:
- Such events are rare and typically announced/planned
- The English Wikipedia community has become more restrictive about mass bot-created stubs
- No such event is indicated in any source

The probability of YES is extremely low.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for Wikipedia reaching a specific article milestone within a given short window depends entirely on whether the current count is near the threshold. Here, the current count (7,073,984) is ~1% below the threshold (7,145,000), with only 8 days to close a gap that would require 17x normal growth. 

Historical upsets in this domain: Wikipedia article count growth is highly predictable and smooth (barring bot events). The probability of an extraordinary bot-driven spike in 8 days without any advance indication is very low — perhaps 1-2%.

I'll set this at approximately **2%** to account for the small but non-zero possibility of a large-scale automated article creation event.
