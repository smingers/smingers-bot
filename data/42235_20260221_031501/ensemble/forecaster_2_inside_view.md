Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Ukrainian NV.ua (Jan 15, 2026)** – Mainstream Ukrainian news outlet covering Wikipedia's 25th anniversary. States "The English Wikipedia has over 7.1 million articles." Factual claim, likely sourced from Wikipedia's own statistics page. Moderate quality; "over 7.1 million" is consistent with rounding from ~7.07-7.1M. Date: Jan 15, 2026.

2. **Exame/Terra/Watson.ch (Jan 2026)** – Multiple international outlets covering Wikipedia's anniversary. Consistently cite "over 7 million" or "about 7 million" English Wikipedia articles. These are factual claims corroborating each other. Moderate-high quality as multiple independent sources agree.

3. **AFP (Jan 3, 2026)** – Wire service (high credibility). States "over 7.1 million in English." Primary wire report, factual. High quality.

4. **Day.Az citing IXBT (Jan 11, 2026)** – States Grokipedia has surpassed 6.09 million articles, "reaching 86% of the total number of articles in the English-language Wikipedia." This implies English Wikipedia ≈ 7.08 million articles (6.09M / 0.86 ≈ 7.08M). Moderate quality (secondary source), but the math is internally consistent.

5. **Nature (Jan 28, 2026)** – High-quality peer-reviewed journal's news section. States "~500 new entries added every day" to English Wikipedia. Expert-level source. This is the most directly relevant growth rate figure.

6. **Outside view API data (Feb 21, 2026)** – Direct MediaWiki API pull showing 7,073,984 articles. Primary, verifiable, highest quality. This is the anchor.

7. **Wikimedia Foundation blog posts (Dec 2025)** – Official source, but focuses on readership, not article counts. Low direct relevance.

8. **AskNews articles** – Mostly irrelevant to article count. The IIT-Guwahati article discusses error detection in Wikipedia (no count data). The AI trust article mentions Wikipedia's human-curated model. None provide direct article count data beyond what's already established.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Current article count ~7.07M** (API data, primary source, Feb 21, 2026): Gap to threshold = ~71,016 articles. This is the most important single data point. Weight: Very high.
- **Multiple independent sources confirm ~7.1M as of Jan 2026**: AFP, NV.ua, Terra, Watson.ch all say "over 7.1 million" — but these appear to be rounding up from ~7.07M or using slightly different counting methods. The API figure of 7,073,984 is more precise and more recent.
- **Nature's ~500 articles/day growth rate**: At 500/day × 8 days = 4,000 articles. Gap needed = 71,016. This is structurally impossible under normal growth.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **No reports of planned mass article creation**: No news of approved bot tasks, namespace reclassifications, or extraordinary events that would spike article count.
- **Historical growth pattern**: English Wikipedia grows ~160-200k/year (~440-550/day). Eight days of growth ≈ 3,500-4,400 articles. Far below the 71,016 needed.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Grokipedia comparison** (Day.Az): Implies English Wikipedia at ~7.08M as of Jan 11, 2026, consistent with the API figure.
- **AI-generated content concerns**: Some discussion of AI potentially flooding Wikipedia, but community controls prevent this.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Prediction timeframe**: 8 days (Feb 21 → Mar 1, 2026).

At the current rate of ~500 articles/day, English Wikipedia will add ~4,000 articles in 8 days, reaching approximately 7,078,000 — still ~67,000 short of the 7,145,000 threshold.

If the timeframe were **halved** (4 days): Even less likely to resolve Yes (~2,000 articles added, gap widens).

If the timeframe were **doubled** (16 days): Still only ~8,000 articles added, reaching ~7,082,000 — still far short. Resolution would remain No.

The math is so unfavorable that even doubling the timeframe doesn't change the outcome. The question essentially cannot resolve Yes under normal circumstances.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view established ~0.8% probability. The inside view evidence strongly confirms this:

1. **Primary API data** shows 7,073,984 articles on Feb 21, 2026 — a gap of 71,016 to the threshold.
2. **Nature's authoritative ~500/day growth rate** means only ~4,000 articles will be added in 8 days.
3. **No evidence of extraordinary events**: No approved bot tasks, no namespace reclassifications, no mass import events reported anywhere.
4. **Multiple corroborating sources** all place the count in the 7.07-7.1M range as of Jan-Feb 2026.

The only scenarios where this resolves Yes:
- A massive, unprecedented bot-driven article creation event (probability ≤ 0.3%)
- A namespace reclassification that suddenly counts tens of thousands of previously excluded pages (probability ≤ 0.2%)
- The API data is systematically wrong by ~71,000 articles (probability ≤ 0.1%)

Total tail risk: ~0.6%

The outside view of 0.8% is well-supported. I'll slightly tighten to ~1% to account for unknown unknowns and the possibility that some sources citing "over 7.1M" were using a slightly different/higher count than the API figure.

**Probability Calibration**

Base rate: 0.8% (outside view)
Inside view adjustments:
- API data confirms gap of ~71k: No upward shift needed
- Nature's 500/day rate confirms impossibility under normal growth: Slight downward pressure
- No evidence of extraordinary events: No upward shift
- Small residual uncertainty about data accuracy: +0.2%

Final estimate: ~1%

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria**: English Wikipedia "Content pages" count ≥ 7,145,000 at any time before March 1, 2026. Current count ~7,073,984. Gap = ~71,016. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate**: 0.8%. Final prediction ~1%, rooted in base rate with minor adjustment for unknown unknowns. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "1 out of 100 times, English Wikipedia reaches 7,145,000 articles before March 1, 2026." This makes sense — the gap is ~71k articles, requiring ~17× the normal daily rate for 8 days. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - API shows 7,073,984 articles (Feb 21, 2026) — gap = 71,016 ✓
   - Nature: ~500 new articles/day → 8 days = ~4,000 articles ✓
   - No reports of mass article creation events ✓
   - Multiple sources confirm ~7.07-7.1M range ✓

5. **Blind-spot**: A secretly approved, large-scale bot task creates ~70k stub articles in 8 days. This would make the forecast look wrong. Probability: <0.5%. Even if this happened, community review would likely delete most stubs quickly.

6. **Status quo**: Wikipedia grows slowly and steadily. No change in trend expected. Status quo = No resolution.

Probability: 1%
