Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution criteria (≤30 words)
Resolves YES if English Wikipedia Special:Statistics “Content pages” reaches ≥7,145,000 at any time from Feb 21, 2026 through Feb 28, 2026 (before Mar 1, 2026).

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, what’s factual)
- Agent report (undated but cites live query on 2026-02-21): Claims English Wikipedia count is 7,073,984 (labeled “articles”). High relevance, but secondhand (we don’t see the raw Special:Statistics snapshot here). Likely accurate order-of-magnitude.
- Nature (Jan 28, 2026): Reputable outlet. Factual claim: English Wikipedia adds “some 500 new entries every day.” Does not give current total.
- Exame (Jan 28, 2026): Business magazine. Claims English Wikipedia has “about 7 million entries” as of Dec 2025. Likely approximate, secondary.
- NV infographic (Jan 15, 2026): Media outlet. Claims English Wikipedia has “over 7.1 million articles.” Secondary, but aligned with other sources.
- AFP (Jan 3, 2026): High-quality wire. States English Wikipedia ~7.1 million. Secondary but credible.
- Wikimedia Foundation blog (Dec 2, 2025): Primary for readership/volunteers, but gives no article/content-page totals. Indirect context only.
- Other AskNews items (Times of India research, Business Standard opinion, etc.): Not about article counts; essentially irrelevant to threshold mechanics.

Key takeaway: Multiple credible secondary sources converge on ~7.1M “articles/entries” around Jan–Feb 2026 and ~500/day creation rate. No source suggests an imminent discontinuity (e.g., mass import) that could add ~70k pages in days.

(b) Evidence analysis with weights (linked to resolution mechanics)
Strong evidence
- Arithmetic + short window: If current level is ~7.074M, reaching 7.145M in ~8 days requires ~8,900/day—~17–20× normal growth. This is a hard constraint.
- Historical growth rates (agent: ~450–525/day recent): Strong predictive power over an 8-day horizon.

Moderate evidence
- Nature’s “~500 new entries/day” (credible, recent): Supports the status-quo growth rate assumption.

Weak evidence
- Anniversary/relevance articles (Wikimedia blog, Exame editorial-style framing): Indicate ongoing activity but don’t move the quantitative forecast.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: 8 days (Feb 21 → Mar 1, 2026).
- If timeframe halved (~4 days): Probability becomes even closer to zero (even less time to close the ~71k gap).
- If timeframe doubled (~16 days): Still extremely unlikely (would still require ~4,400/day), unless a structural break (policy/automation/import) occurs.

(d) Justification (inside view adjustment from outside view)
Outside view base rate was 2% (already very low). The inside-view evidence pushes lower because:
- The needed increment (~71k) is far beyond plausible stochastic variation around the normal daily creation rate.
- Measurement uncertainty cannot realistically account for a 71k shortfall; even a large counting error (thousands) wouldn’t bridge it.
- The main “Yes” pathway would be a deliberate mass page-creation/import event or a definitional/reporting change on Special:Statistics. English Wikipedia norms/policies make mass automated article creation unlikely on this scale in a week, and no sources hint at such an event.

Net: I move down from 2% to a sub-1% probability.

Probability calibration
- Status quo continuation: ~500/day × 8 ≈ 4,000 additional pages/articles → far below 7,145,000 → NO.
- I assign a small residual probability for (i) a one-off technical/definition jump in the “Content pages” number, or (ii) an unexpected mass creation event: these are low but not impossible.

Checklist:
1) Criteria match: YES if Special:Statistics “Content pages” ≥ 7,145,000 at any time Feb 21–Feb 28, 2026.
2) Outside view base rate: 2%.
3) Consistency check: “0.5 out of 100 times, English Wikipedia reaches ≥7,145,000 content pages before Mar 1, 2026.” Coherent given the required growth rate.
4) Top evidence (≤20 words each):
   - Current level ~7.074M; need +71k in 8 days.
   - Typical creation rate ~450–525/day (Nature: ~500/day).
   - No indicators of mass import or definitional change.
5) Blind spot: “Content pages” definition differs and already exceeds 7,145,000 during the window (would make YES near-certain).
6) Status quo outcome: Continued steady growth implies NO.

Probability: 0.5%
