**Clarifying article counts**

I noticed the ambiguity regarding content page counts and article counts, especially since the question isn't satisfied yet. The reference suggests it's below 7,145,000, so I wonder if content pages equate to article counts? Their wiki might be using these numbers similarly. While I could estimate a low probability of 1%, I need to account for definition confusion. If actual content pages surpass that number, the probability would quickly shift to nearly 100%, but I can't confirm without browsing. I should examine Special:Statistics directly.**Assessing article counts**

I’m looking at various sources, and one indicates there are 7,073,984 articles as of February 21, 2026, while another cites around 7 million entries as of December 2025. Another source claims over 7.1 million articles. This suggests that the criteria for content pages is likely tied to the article count. Given the current situation, I estimate the probability at about 0.2%, factoring in that reaching 71,000 new articles in just eight days would be rare. I’ll prepare source analysis and note key reports.**Evaluating evidence and calibration**

I need to categorize sources as strong, moderate, or weak. The agent's current count and growth rates are strong evidence, along with structural and mathematical support. Nature's report of 500 entries a day counts as moderate, while general anniversary articles seem weak. The timeframe is limited to just eight days, which makes a significant impact. I’ll start with a 2% probability and adjust down to 0.5%. If there's confusion between content pages and articles, it could raise the probability, but sources imply criteria aren’t met.
