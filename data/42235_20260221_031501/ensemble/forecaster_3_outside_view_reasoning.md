**Analyzing article creation rates**

I'm considering the possibility of mass creation through automated stubs. However, enwiki has strict deletion policies, and the current article creation rate seems stable, with no precedent for a spike of over 70,000 in a week. It could be a software bug affecting count adjustments, possibly leading to a decrease rather than an increase. I'll set the probability at around 0.2%.  

I want to structure my response with source analyses, like Wikimedia’s 2024 review and claims from various other articles.**Calculating probability thresholds**

I need to determine the odds of reaching 71k with a standard deviation above 60, which feels very tiny. For calibration, I'm considering the base rate for meeting such a large threshold in a short time frame. Using a Fermi estimate, I’m estimating a probable daily growth of around 500, with a maximum potential of 2000 during an event, but that's still far off. 

I think the probability should be less than 1%. I’ll settle on a more precise estimation of about 0.28%.
