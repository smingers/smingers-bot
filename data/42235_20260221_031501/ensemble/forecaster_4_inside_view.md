Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of the question  
English Wikipedia must show ≥ 7 145 000 “Content pages” on Special:Statistics at any moment between 21 Feb 2026 and 29 Feb 2026 23:59 UTC.  

2. Source analysis (quality, facts vs. opinion)  
a. MediaWiki API snapshot (21 Feb 2026, machine–read): 7 073 984 content pages. – Strong, direct, current, factual.  
b. Nature (28 Jan 2026): “≈ 500 new English-language articles per day.” – Moderate, reputable journal; statement probably copied from WMF press briefing.  
c. Multiple 25-year anniversary pieces (Jan 2026, Exame, Terra, NV, AFP, etc.): converge on “> 7.1 million English articles”. – Moderate; figures rounded, all pre-Feb-2026.  
d. Outside data 2024–2025 dumps (Wikistats): +162 k (2024) and +192 k (2025) net growth ⇒ ≈ 450–525/day. – Strong historical evidence.  
e. Newswire/AskNews items (Feb 2026) – none mention article count; no bearing on resolution.  
No expert opinions argue for an imminent huge jump; no WMF technical notes about re-classifying pages.

3. Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Live API count 7 073 984; gap to target 71 016.  
• Historical daily net growth ≈ 500 → 8-day projection ≈ 4 000.  
Moderate:  
• Consistent press reports of “≈ 500 new articles/day”.  
• Structural governance: en-wiki bot/stub creation tightly regulated, making sudden +70 k burst very unlikely.  
Weak:  
• Theoretical risk of accidental statistics re-definition or mass import.  
• Rare precedent of other language Wikipedias adding tens of thousands of bot stubs quickly.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Time left: a shade under 8 days.  
Halving (4 days): required pace ≈ 17 700/day – essentially impossible.  
Doubling (16 days): required pace ≈ 4 440/day – still ≥ 8× normal; probability would rise only a couple of tenths of a point.

5. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate (outside view) 0.25 %.  
Factors pushing up: small chance of technical/statistical glitch (+0.2 %).  
Factors pushing down: live gap/pace maths, strong institutional inertia (−0.05 %).  
Inside-view best estimate: 0.4  %.

6. What has to happen for Yes  
Either  
• A one-off spike of ≥ 71 k accepted stubs (never seen at this scale on en-wiki), or  
• A back-end change that suddenly re-labels tens of thousands of pages as “Content”.  
Both are possible but extraordinarily rare.

7. Experts/markets  
No prediction markets; WMF engineering lists silent; no hints of an upcoming count recalibration.

Probability calibration

“I expect that about 0.4 times in 100, the English Wikipedia will cross 7 145 000 articles before 1 Mar 2026.”

Checklist:
• Outside view base rate used: 0.25 %.  
• Key evidence lines: (1) live count 7 073 984; (2) historic growth 450–525/day; (3) gap 71 k in <8 days; (4) en-wiki governance resists mass bot dumps.  
• Blind-spot: unforeseen software update mis-counting redirected pages could inflate the statistic overnight; would push probability to >50 %.  
• Status-quo outcome (No) favoured; short window supports nudging toward it.

Probability: 0.4%
