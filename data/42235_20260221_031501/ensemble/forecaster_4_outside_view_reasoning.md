**Estimating Wikipedia Growth**

I need to estimate the likelihood that English Wikipedia will reach 7,145,000 articles by March 1, 2026, from the current count of 7,073,984. With only 8 days left, that means we need an additional 71,016 articles, averaging about 8,877 articles per day, which feels impossible since historical averages are around 500 per day. Although the current figure might be an undercount, the growth targets still seem highly improbable given past trends. So, it's not looking good for that goal.**Analyzing Probability of Article Growth**

I'm estimating the likelihood of English Wikipedia reaching 7,145,000 articles by March 1, 2026. Achieving about 5,625 articles per day over the next 8 days seems extremely unlikely, making the outside view probability less than 1%. Historically, growth averages around 160,000 to 200,000 articles annually. In just 8 days, I'd expect around 3,600 to 4,400 new articles—far short of the needed 45,000. While substantial bot activity in the past did create mass articles, current guidelines limit this. I feel confident saying there's a very low chance for such rapid growth.**Estimating Article Growth Probability**

I’m examining the probability of adding at least 71,000 articles in 8 days, based on an annual average of 190,000 articles, averaging about 520 per day. That’s a huge jump—about 136 times the expected daily growth, making it extremely unlikely given the Poisson distribution. Historically, there have been mass-bot events, like Lsjbot, but those were limited to languages with less strict policies. Attempts like the Chickopedia mania in 2019 were smaller in scale. Overall, I estimate the probability at about 0.2%.
