Analysis:

0. Headline restated
English Wikipedia must show ≥7,145,000 “Content pages” on Special:Statistics at any moment up to 00:00 UTC on 1 Mar 2026 (8.9 days from now).

1. Source analysis (quality & recency)
• Wikimedia API snapshot, 21 Feb 2026: 7,073,984 content pages.  Primary, real-time, highest quality.  
• Nature, 28 Jan 2026: quotes 500 new English articles/day; reputable journal, recent, but rounded.  
• NV (Ukrainian outlet), 15 Jan 2026: “English Wikipedia >7.1 M articles”; mainstream press, corroborates current level.  
• Terra & Exame (Brazil), 15‒28 Jan 2026: “>7 M articles”; secondary confirmation.  
• AskNews packet – no item reports any pending mass-creation project; other pieces are unrelated.  
Quality hierarchy: API > Nature > major news outlets; all within five weeks.

2. Evidence analysis
Strong:
• API count 7.074 M on 21 Feb 2026.  
• Historical daily growth 2024-25 ≈ 500–530/day (Wikistats, Nature).  

Moderate:
• Slight uptick 2025 vs 2024 (+192 k vs +162 k) suggests mild acceleration.  
• No community noticeboards show proposals for huge bot-run article floods (institutional inertia).  

Weak:
• Elon Musk’s “Grokipedia” brag (ru outlet) – irrelevant.  
• Generic “AI will change everything” opinion pieces.

3. Timeframe analysis
Remaining window: 8.9 days.  
Needed net gain: 71,016 articles.  
Required pace: ≈ 8,000/day (15× normal).  
If the window were doubled to 18 days, pace requirement drops to 3,900/day—still 7× normal; probability would rise only a few points.  If halved to 4.5 days, requirement balloons to 16,000/day; probability would halve again.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment from 0.9 % base rate
Upward forces: none observable.  
Downward forces: fresh API data confirms gap of 71 k; no evidence of imminent mass bot activity; community process for large bot jobs (>10 k pages) typically needs formal approval (7-day discussion) that has not occurred.  
Net: inside view slightly lower than base.  I assign 0.7 %.

Probability calibration:
“Roughly 1 in 140” chance that English Wikipedia crosses 7.145 M before 1 Mar 2026.  This incorporates <0.5 % for an unprecedented, instantly-approved LLM bot flood and <0.2 % for a statistics-counter glitch.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase done (see head).  
2. Outside base 0.9 %; final anchored.  
3. Consistency: 0.7/100 times the threshold is reached – plausible.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   – API count 7.074 M (primary data).  
   – Need +71 k in 9 days (math).  
   – Historic pace 500/day (Nature & Wikistats).  
   – Bot jobs require week-long approval (structural).  
   – No active proposals observed (current forums).  
5. Blind-spot: Foundation flips switch reclassifying draft/redirect pages as “content”, instantly adding >70 k.  Chance <0.5 %.  
6. Status-quo is continued slow growth; favors “No”.

Probability: 0.7%
