**Analyzing data trends**

I’m observing the data: some sources suggest 7.1 million as of January 2026, while outside analyses noted 7.073 million on February 21. That’s only a gain of about 30,000 in roughly 1.5 months, which averages out to around 640 per day—similar trends. Looking ahead, significant changes seem unlikely, maybe even improbable. Concerns exist about potential measurement glitches or unusual data conversions. Overall, I’m leaning towards a probability estimate of around 1% for a significant increase. Let’s craft a thorough answer!
