Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Wikimedia.nz “Wikipedia Wrapped” (Dec 2024) – News-style year-in-review.  Factual readership/editor figures; no article-count data.  Medium quality, dated.  
2. Diff blog (May 2016) – Community blog post.  Factual statement that featured articles (<0.1 %) numbered ≈ 4,700, implying ≥4.7 M total articles in 2016.  Old but reliable for the date.  
3. India Today (28 Oct 2025) – Tech news piece about “Grokipedia”.  States English Wikipedia “around 7.1 M articles”.  Acceptable mainstream source; figure rounded.  
4. International Business Times UK (30 Dec 2025) – Business news story.  Notes Wikipedia “more than 7.1 M articles” and gives 500-per-day creation rate.  Same order of magnitude, slightly newer; again rounded.  
5. Grunge.com (Jun 2020) – Popular-culture article.  Mentions “more than 6 M articles”.  Lightly sourced but consistent with Wikimedia figures.  
6. Agent report – Direct API call (21 Feb 2026 00:00 UTC) shows 7,073,984 articles; also provides dump figures (6,719,460 on 1 Jan 2024) and yearly growth estimates (≈ +162 k in 2024, +192 k in 2025).  Primary data from Wikimedia API/Wikistats; high quality, minimal opinion.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
i. Long-term (multi-year) article growth of English Wikipedia since 2016.  
ii. Year-over-year growth the last two complete years (2024 & 2025).  
iii. Short-term (daily/weekly) fluctuation since 2024.  

Class ii is best: it captures the current era’s pace, after large-scale bot booms ended, and before any unknown future shocks.  Class iii would be ideal but we lack a granular published series; class i overstates early explosive growth.

Base-rate from class ii:  
• 2024: +162 k ⇒ 444/day  
• 2025: +192 k ⇒ 526/day  
Take 2025 rate (slightly accelerating) as baseline: ≈ 500 new articles per day.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today → 1 Mar 2026 00:00 UTC: 8.9 days (~214 hours).  
• Required net increase: 7,145,000 – 7,073,984 = 71,016 articles.  
• Implied needed pace: 71,016 / 8.9 ≈ 8,000 articles per day, ~15–17× the normal 500/day.  

Historical pattern: since 2016 no interval of a week on English Wikipedia has recorded creation of >20 k net new articles, let alone 70 k.  Occasional single-day spurts of a few thousand stubs (e.g., bot-created French-commune pages in 2022) exist but have never sustained for a week and have been partly offset by deletions.

(d) Justification  
The outside view ignores any speculative “inside” developments (e.g., sudden large bot projects).  Using the recent-years growth rate (~500/day), the expected increase over the next 9 days is roughly 4,500.  Even a 3-sigma positive deviation (assume σ≈300/day) would add <6,000 more.  To reach the threshold would require a ≥20-sigma event or an unprecedented automated campaign approved and run immediately, both extraordinarily unlikely.  

Upsets in Wikipedia article counts are rarer than in many domains: governance is community-moderated, large bot runs are proposed weeks in advance, and the English project has not experienced a +70 k surge in any 10-day window in the past decade.  The base rate for such an upset is well under 1 % per comparable timeframe.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 0 % (if growth stays at trend) vs. perhaps 1–2 % to allow for black-swan mass-creation.  
Expert/market expectation: no published betting markets, but community discussions show no pending mega-stub project.  
Allow 0.2 % for measurement quirks (the live “Content pages” counter can oscillate a few hundred in either direction each hour, never tens of thousands).  
Sum of tail risks yields ~0.9 % chance.

Outside View Prediction:
0.9 %
