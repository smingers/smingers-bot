**Generating outside view predictions**

I'm focusing on crafting an analysis that emphasizes the outside view prediction, using a baseline from historical context. While we have the latest news available, it's important to treat that as a reference point rather than the main focus. The outside view typically adheres to a reference class base rate and doesn't delve into unique specifics. For our analysis, I need to use the article count of 7,073,984 from today's date (2026-02-21) without getting too detailed about current events.**Estimating outside view probabilities**

I’m calculating that we’re about 71,000 articles short of reaching the 7,145,000 threshold on English Wikipedia by March 1, 2026, which gives us about 8 or 9 days. To achieve that, we’d need to increase the article count by around 8,900 articles per day—an increase near 17 times the usual growth rate, which seems highly unlikely. Historical trends show a typical daily growth of around 500 articles. Therefore, my rough estimate for the probability of hitting that target is about 0.5%. I’ll summarize the source analysis for variations in daily article growth between 2020 and 2025 as the next step.**Calculating article growth probability**

I’m analyzing article counts over the years: starting at over 6 million in June 2020, reaching approximately 7.1 million by October 2025, and being at 7.074 million as of February 21, 2026. This shows a growth rate of about 454 articles per day recently.

To gain 71,000 articles in just 8 days seems improbable, leading me to estimate a probability of about 0.9%. However, I need to consider any possible earlier counts before the specified opening time, making the likelihood still quite minimal. Let's finalize that probability estimate at 0.9%.
