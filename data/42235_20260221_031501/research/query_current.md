Analysis:
To handicap the forecast we need the current “Content pages” count on English Wikipedia and its recent growth trend. Key evidence includes:
• The latest figure displayed on Special:Statistics (updated in near-real time).  
• Any February 2026 blog posts, Wikimedia mailing-list notes, or press pieces noting a milestone (e.g., “7.1 million articles reached”).  
• Historical creation rate (articles per day/month) to see whether the remaining days until 1 March 2026 are enough to cross 7,145,000 if it hasn’t already.  

Therefore, searches should surface up-to-the-minute statistics pages, community or Foundation announcements, and recent news coverage of Wikipedia’s article count milestones.
