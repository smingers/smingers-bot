Analysis:
The key to judging whether Wikipedia will cross 7 ,145 ,000 articles during the next nine days is its recent growth rate and the current article count (“Content pages” on Special:Statistics).  Relevant historical context therefore includes:  
• The present “Content pages” count (updated in near-real-time on Special:Statistics or via the Wikimedia API).  
• Month-by-month / day-by-day article-count history for the English edition, so we can compute average daily growth and see if a jump of the required size is plausible.  
• News or blog posts announcing recent milestones (7.1 million, 7.15 million, etc.) that give unofficial counts.  
• Any recent changes to deletion policies, creation bots, or mass imports that could accelerate or decelerate article creation.
