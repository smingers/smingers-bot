Security Council, with analysts suggesting this could provide a pretext for military intervention, as occurred in June 2025 when Israel launched strikes within 24 hours of the IAEA's censure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2026 01:20 AM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-4017599)\n\n**IIT-Guwahati researchers give Wikipedia a trust upgrade | Guwahati News - The Times of India**\nResearchers from IIT-Guwahati, led by Professor Amit Awekar and M.Tech student Anuj Khare (batch of 2022), have developed a multilingual mathematical method to detect and correct subtle errors in Wikipedia, enhancing trust in the world\u2019s largest online encyclopedia. The method identifies 'Surface Name Errors'\u2014such as typos (e.g., 'Gawahati' instead of 'Guwahati') or span errors involving extra or incorrect words in hyperlinks\u2014by analyzing frequency patterns across eight languages: English, Hindi, Sanskrit, Urdu, German, Italian, Marathi, and Gujarati. The system breaks each link into four components: source page, target page, linking text, and surrounding context. A link is flagged as potentially erroneous if the surface name appears fewer than 10 times or constitutes less than 5% of all links to the target page. Tested on English Wikipedia snapshots from 2018 and 2022, the method correctly identified 30% of errors that were later manually corrected by editors, validating its accuracy. Over 99% of suggested corrections were accepted by the Wikipedia community. The solution was showcased at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 and aims to improve reliability for both human readers and AI models trained on Wikipedia data. Professor Awekar emphasized that 'good data is the beginning of any good AI model and downstream application,' urging caution against blind trust in web data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 06:22 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/iit-guwahati-researchers-give-wikipedia-a-trust-upgrade/articleshow/128619694.cms)\n\n**Regaining trust in the era of AI requires stronger norms and oversight**\nA Graphite study of 65,000 English-language web articles found that before ChatGPT, approximately 5% of articles were primarily AI-generated. By late 2024, this figure surpassed 50%, and by April 2025, Ahrefs reported that 74% of newly created web pages contained AI-generated content. The proliferation of AI-produced content has led to a decline in authenticity and trustworthiness online, with generative AI enabling the cheap, large-scale production of plausible but false narratives. This undermines the reliability of user-generated content such as Amazon reviews and social media influencer opinions, which were once seen as alternatives to institutional authority. The 'illusory truth effect'\u2014where repeated claims feel true even when false\u2014further exacerbates the problem. As a result, the article predicts a recentralization of trust, with people increasingly relying on verifiable institutions, named authors, and transparent editorial processes. Examples include The New York Times\u2019 acquisition of Wirecutter for $30 million in 2016, now a major revenue driver, and Wikipedia\u2019s human-curated model, both valued for authenticity and credibility. Institutions that invest in verification infrastructure today will benefit most when trust re-centralizes. The article concludes that credibility compounds slowly and is not permanent; the key question is which institutions will be prepared when the shift occurs. The author emphasizes that while they are a real person verified by Bloomberg, most online content lacks such assurance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 05:41 PM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/regaining-trust-in-the-era-of-ai-requires-stronger-norms-and-oversight-126022001430_1.html)\n\n**Get Ready: 5 Huge Fantasy RPGs Coming in 2026**\nThe article 'Get Ready: 5 Huge Fantasy RPGs Coming in 2026' highlights five major fantasy role-playing games set for release in 2026, with multiple titles launching between March and June.

The current message, which includes instructions about writing news articles and avoiding copyrighted material, is suggested to be updated to only appear during article creation, not in other namespaces. Contributor Yair rand (15 November 2010) argues the message should be restricted to article creation. Pi zero (22 November 2010) suggests using bullet points for clarity, with the copyright clause presented as a separate, distinct point. Another suggestion from Pi zero (9 December 2010) proposes using boldface for the second point to make it stand out.

The article features the first public interview of Sh\u014d Umemoto (57), a founding figure of the Japanese Wikipedia and its first administrator. Umemoto, a composer and co-owner of a company managing electronics sales and his son\u2019s copyrights, began using the English Wikipedia in 2001 during his graduate studies. He was later approached by a non-Japanese speaker to help translate the site into Japanese, leading him to undertake extensive work\u2014translating interface terms like 'Table of Contents' and 'User', and rewriting system files. He single-handedly managed Japanese localization for about a year before becoming a regular editor. Umemoto described his volunteer efforts as natural, driven by his desire to use the platform effectively and help others. He views Wikipedia editing as casual and low-pressure\u2014akin to buying coffee at a convenience store. He has made 899 edits as of January 28, 2026, though he estimates the actual number is over 1,700 when including anonymous edits. He emphasizes Wikipedia\u2019s value in its 'comprehensiveness' and accessibility, noting its vast, unfiltered content offers unique informational value despite lacking peer review. He warns that Wikipedia should only be used as a starting point for research, not as definitive authority. Umemoto also discusses the need for a Japanese legal entity to enable tax-deductible donations, citing South Korea\u2019s model. He expresses concern that AI companies using Wikipedia content without proper attribution may reduce public engagement with the site, weakening the feedback loop essential for improving article quality. He acknowledges that AI-assisted editing could be acceptable if quality remains high. Despite decades of anonymity, Umemoto decided to speak out after being accused of fabricating his role in a 2025 online gathering, fearing future impersonation. He sought to provide verifiable primary documentation to ensure historical accuracy and trustworthiness for future editors. The interview was prompted by his inclusion in a media PR package for Wikipedia\u2019s 25th anniversary.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 09:52 AM\nSource:[\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb](https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASV2L32FGV2LULLI01DM.html)\n\n**Caring for Yourself in 2026: Why Everyone Is Talking About These Supplements This Year**\nThe article 'Cuidarse en 2026: por qu\u00e9 todo el mundo habla de estos suplementos este a\u00f1o' discusses the growing global interest in dietary supplements for improving energy, mental clarity, and overall performance.

As of December 2025, it contains 66 million articles across 342 languages, with the English version alone holding about 7 million entries and over 5 billion words\u2014equivalent to 38 years of uninterrupted reading. The entire archive occupies approximately 775 terabytes, comparable to the storage of 3,000 iPhones. Over the past decade, Wikipedia pages have been viewed 1.9 trillion times, averaging 508 million daily visits. More than 4.4 billion people accessed the site at least once in 2025. Despite no ads, no personal data collection, and no paywall, its reach rivals that of major digital platforms. Over 125 million people have contributed at least one edit, and around 600,000 users actively edit monthly. In 2024, Wikipedia was edited an average of 5.7 times per second, with 40% of edits from authorized bots that update data, fix links, and combat vandalism. A notable trend emerged in 2025: a nearly 8% decline in human-driven page views, attributed to AI-generated responses in search engines. Meanwhile, bots and automated agents generated over 88 billion accesses, primarily for training language models. This reveals a paradox: human-curated, decades-long content is now used as raw material for AI systems that promise to replace human curation. The core value of Wikipedia lies not in its final content, but in its verifiable, transparent, and continuously reviewed process. As the Wikimedia Foundation notes, the competitive advantage in the AI era is not speed, but trust. In 2026, businesses face a strategic challenge: automation does not equate to authority, and immediacy does not imply credibility. The true differentiator is reliability built over time. According to the article, Wikipedia\u2019s enduring relevance stems from its commitment to process, not perfection.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:24 AM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/marketing/25-anos-no-ar-o-que-explica-a-relevancia-da-wikipedia-na-era-dos-algoritmos/)\n\n**Wikipedia@25: A Quarter-Century of Open Knowledge and Global Reach**\nThe editorial 'Wikipedia@25' published on January 17, 2026, by Madhyamam, reflects on Wikipedia's 25-year journey as a global, collaborative knowledge platform. Founded on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, Wikipedia aimed to create a free, comprehensive repository of all human knowledge. Though it has not fully achieved this vision, it has become a vast, multilingual knowledge bank, with over 7 million articles across more than 300 languages. The article highlights Wikipedia's revolutionary model\u2014open editing, peer review, and continuous revision\u2014distinguishing it from traditional encyclopedias like Britannica, which rely on expert-authored content. This participatory model enabled rapid growth and democratized access to knowledge. The editorial emphasizes Wikipedia's role in countering linguistic hegemony by translating content into non-English languages, particularly English, which dominates modern scientific discourse. It notes that 600,000 of Wikipedia\u2019s 7 million articles are in languages other than English. The Malayalam Wikipedia is spotlighted, having launched in December 2002 with its first article, growing from 5,000 articles in its first five years to 87,567 by 2026, thanks to advancements like Unicode fonts that resolved early technical barriers. The piece portrays Wikipedia as a successful, community-driven effort to make knowledge accessible and collectively shaped.\nOriginal language: ml\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 06:30 AM\nSource:[madhyamam.com](https://www.madhyamam.com/opinion/editorial/2026-january-17th-editorial-1486727)\n\n**Wikipedia Turns 25: A Journey of Collaborative Success and AI Challenges**\nWikipedia celebrated its 25th anniversary on January 15, 2026, marking a pivotal moment in internet history since its launch in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Conceived as a radically open, collaborative platform where 'anyone on the planet' could contribute to a global sum of human knowledge, Wikipedia challenged traditional models of knowledge authority by decentralizing content creation. The platform has grown from 25,000 articles in English in 2002 to over seven million today, with the Portuguese version containing 1.1 million articles. Its model relies on community-driven editing, adherence to neutrality, verifiability, and sourcing from reliable references, with disputes resolved through consensus or the Arbitration Committee. While Jimmy Wales emphasizes that neutrality emerges from factual content\u2014'writing what Hitler did is already a condemnation'\u2014Sanger argues that true neutrality requires expert involvement and warns against the risk of bias in open editing. Gender disparities persist, with female editors making up only 10%\u201320% of contributors, prompting initiatives like 'Women in Red'. The platform also faces challenges from AI-generated content, exemplified by the 2025 collapse of the Greenlandic Wikipedia due to AI errors, dubbed the 'destruction spiral'. Meanwhile, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI launched Grokipedia in 2025, an AI-generated encyclopedia with nearly 885,000 articles, criticized by Musk as 'Wokipedia' for its alleged left-leaning bias. Sanger views Grokipedia as a potential successor to Wikipedia, noting that AI can now edit articles directly without human oversight. Wales remains skeptical, stating in late 2025 that it remains unclear whether AI encyclopedias will become significant competitors. The article highlights Wikipedia\u2019s enduring cultural presence, with its 'citation needed' tag becoming a meme, and its role in daily life\u2014from dinner table debates to infinite 'rabbit hole' browsing, as famously noted by Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg: 'We all use Wikipedia more than we pee.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 04:46 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/wikipedia-faz-25-anos-entre-sucesso-colaborativo-e-ameacas-da-ia,d75a25f59960c1fb84884bec8a204d3fk0oyq8n6.html)\n\n**Wikipedia Turns 25 \u2013 How an Experiment Transformed Global Knowledge**\nWikipedia celebrated its 25th anniversary on January 15, 2026, marking a pivotal milestone in the digital age. Launched in 2001 as a radical experiment by two internet pioneers, Wikipedia has grown into the world\u2019s largest free online encyclopedia, with over 65 million articles in more than 300 languages. The German version alone contains over three million entries, growing at an average rate of 350 to 400 new articles per day since 2004. This growth is driven by approximately 250,000 volunteer contributors who write, edit, and source content collaboratively. Wikipedia revolutionized knowledge creation by pioneering the 'Web 2.0' model, shifting from passive consumption to active user participation. Despite its success, the platform faces persistent challenges: concerns over accuracy, edit wars, political bias, and the lack of citable authorship have led many academic institutions to reject it as a source. Additionally, recruitment of younger contributors has stagnated, threatening long-term sustainability. A new threat has emerged in 2026: artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT increasingly use Wikipedia content without proper attribution, sometimes generating misinformation. Wikipedia\u2019s community maintains that AI should only support moderation, not replace human curation, emphasizing that human responsibility and care in knowledge-building cannot be automated. The project remains a global symbol of openness, collaboration, and shared knowledge, embodying the ideals of early internet pioneers and serving as both a legacy and a challenge for future generations.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 08:42 AM\nSource:[watson.ch/](https://www.watson.ch/!767547391)\n\n**25 Years of Wikipedia: Key Facts About the Encyclopedia and Its Ukrainian Version -- Infographic**\nOn January 15, 2026, it marks 25 years since the launch of Wikipedia, the world\u2019s most popular free online encyclopedia, which allows anyone to edit its content. Founded on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, Wikipedia was established on open-source principles and collaborative editing. It became the largest encyclopedia in history by 2007 and remains one of the most visited websites globally. The first article in the Ukrainian Wikipedia, 'Atom', was created on January 30, 2004. The Ukrainian Wikipedia officially launched on April 4, 2004, with 1,000 articles. Today, the Ukrainian Wikipedia contains over 1.4 million articles, ranking 14th among all language editions, 10th among European Wikipedia versions, and 3rd among Slavic-language editions. The English Wikipedia has over 7.1 million articles. The most-viewed article worldwide in 2025 is about Charlie Kirk (44.9 million views), an American MAGA movement activist assassinated during a public debate on September 10, 2025. In Ukraine, the most-searched articles in 2024 were about Oleksandr Syrskyi (1.1 million views), the Ukrainian commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces since February 8, 2024. In 2025, the most-searched article was about Andriy Parubiy (500,300 views), former head of the Verkhovna Rada (2016\u20132019), who was assassinated on August 30, 2025. The most popular Ukrainian Wikipedia articles in 2025 by month are listed in the infographic published by NV.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 04:50 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukr/world/countries/vikipediya-25-rokiv-infografika-pro-istoriyu-statistiku-y-populyarni-statti-enciklopediji-50575766.html)\n\n**Wikipedia Turns 25 with 63 Million Articles Published**\nWikipedia celebrated its 25th anniversary on January 15, 2026, having published over 63 million articles across 334 languages, created by volunteers worldwide and with more than 3.5 billion edits accumulated. The platform is managed by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, primarily funded through donations. As of July 2024, Wikipedia ranked fifth in Semrush's list of the most visited websites globally and remains among the top ten most-trafficked portals worldwide. Its growth has led to the creation of sister projects including Wiktionary, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, Wikiquote, Wikinews, Wikisource, Wikispecies, and Wikivoyage. According to its founders, Wikipedia is built on three core principles: it is a structured encyclopedia for gathering and disseminating information; it operates as a wiki allowing user edits; and it is an open-content project. Jimmy Wales stated the central goal is to provide a free, high-quality encyclopedia accessible to all people globally in their native languages, promoting universal access to knowledge. Among the 334 languages, 19 have over one million articles, including English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, and Portuguese. Significant portions of Wikipedia\u2019s content are available offline through physical and digital formats. Over its 25-year history, Wikipedia has inspired mirror sites worldwide and spawned derivative encyclopedias on other platforms.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 10:22 PM\nSource:[www.elcolombiano.com](https://www.elcolombiano.com/tendencias/wikipedia-cumple-25-anos-DF32511662)\n\n**Elon Musk Says 'Grokipedia' Will Soon Surpass Wikipedia**\nAs of January 11, 2026, Grokipedia has surpassed 6.09 million articles, reaching 86% of the total number of articles in the English-language Wikipedia, and continues to grow at an exponential rate. According to Day.Az, citing IXBT, over 128,137 edits have been approved by Grok. Elon Musk stated, 'In a short time, Grokipedia.com will significantly surpass Wikipedia.' The platform previously crossed the 3 million article milestone just days earlier, with more than 92,000 edits approved by Grok. In comparison, the Russian Wikipedia had approximately 2 million articles at the beginning of 2026.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 05:56 AM\nSource:[\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Day.Az](https://news.day.az/hitech/1808628.html)\n\n**25 Years of Wikipedia: The Online Encyclopedia Stands Up to Artificial Intelligence**\nWikipedia celebrated its 25th anniversary on January 15, 2024, having been founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in the United States. The online encyclopedia now hosts approximately 65 million articles across more than 300 languages, with over 7.1 million in English and nearly 3.1 million in German. It operates on the principle of swarm intelligence, relying on nearly 250,000 volunteers for content updates and sourcing, while having only around 180 full-time employees at Wikimedia Germany. Funding comes almost entirely from donations, with the Wikimedia Foundation raising about \u20ac8 million in December 2025 through a recent campaign, and minimal revenue from the commercial product Wikimedia Enterprise. The most-read article in 2025 was the English entry on murdered U.S. activist Charlie Kirk, with nearly 15 million views, followed by Donald Trump and Pope Leo XIV. Wikipedia acknowledges its limitations, stating it is often not considered a reliable source for academic work due to concerns over accuracy, vandalism, outdated content, and bias\u2014particularly in politically sensitive topics. A July 2025 investigation by the 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung' found over one-third of German Wikipedia articles problematic. Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, criticized Wikipedia as 'woke' and dominated by 'left-wing activists,' while promoting his own AI-driven competitor 'Grokipedia' powered by his chatbot Grok. Wikipedia maintains it serves as a counter-model to misinformation and political pressure. Co-founder Jimmy Wales admitted that some politically charged articles, such as the English entry on Israel following the Hamas attack in October 2023, lack balance. Wales believes Wikipedia will endure because people still seek trustworthy, high-quality information, especially since AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok frequently produce hallucinations. A dedicated volunteer team in the English Wikipedia identifies and corrects or removes AI-generated content, though such content remains rare. A major concern is that AI systems scrape Wikipedia for answers without crediting the source or paying for access. Wales stated there are currently no plans to sue, saying, 'We are maybe too nice.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 03, 2026 04:55 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/88VJ4NQ)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
