Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Le Monde (Feb 12, 2026)**: Partially paywalled. Reports 524 dead/missing Jan 1–Feb 10, 2026, citing IOM directly. IOM spokesperson quoted calling it "worst start to a year in over a decade." High-quality outlet, credible IOM attribution. Key factual data: 524 deaths through Feb 10.

**Al Jazeera (Feb 22, 2026)**: Reports ongoing incidents on the question's opening date. Notes 375 dead/missing in January (central Mediterranean), 53 dead from Feb 6 Zuwara capsizing. Cites IOM data and UNHCR. High-quality outlet. Most current source available.

**UN News (Feb 9, 2026)**: Official UN outlet. Confirms 375 dead/missing in January alone (central Med), 53 from Feb 6 incident. Factual: total ~428+ by early February per IOM. Very high credibility.

**Middle East Monitor / AFP (Feb 10, 2026)**: Reports IOM figure of "at least 484" deaths on central Mediterranean route in 2026 as of Feb 10. Consistent with other sources. Reliable, IOM-sourced.

**AFP via migrant charities article (Feb 20, 2026)**: Reports IOM stated "at least 567 migrant lives have been lost in the central Mediterranean so far in 2026" as of Feb 20. This is a significant factual update—567 confirmed deaths by Feb 20. High credibility (AFP, IOM-sourced).

**Daijiworld/YesPunjab/AFP (Feb 21-22, 2026)**: Reports Crete capsizing with at least 5 dead, ~20 missing. Ongoing search. Consistent across multiple outlets. Reliable, recent.

**Giornale di Sicilia (Feb 20, 2026)**: Italian source reporting ~1,000 migrants missing from Cyclone Harry (Jan 14-21). Humanitarian organizations estimate. Less reliable for IOM dataset purposes—these are NGO estimates, not confirmed IOM figures.

**L'Eco di Bergamo (Feb 21, 2026)**: Reports ~15 bodies found on Sicily/Calabria coasts. Anecdotal, Italian local press.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **IOM confirmed 567 deaths by Feb 20** (AFP, Feb 20): This is the most critical data point. With 567 confirmed deaths by Feb 20 and 8 more days remaining (Feb 21-28), the gap to 800 is 233 deaths. At the observed rate from Feb 10-20 (567-524=43 in 10 days = 4.3/day), this would yield only ~34 additional deaths, reaching ~601. However, this rate seems low given the Jan pace (375/31 = ~12/day). The discrepancy likely reflects IOM data lag.

- **IOM explicitly acknowledges massive undercounting**: Multiple IOM statements confirm "hundreds more deaths believed unrecorded," particularly from Cyclone Harry (Jan 14-21). The NGO estimate of ~1,000 missing from that cluster alone vs. IOM's January figure of 375 suggests enormous potential for retroactive revision.

- **Record-breaking pace confirmed by IOM**: IOM spokesperson called 2026 "worst start to a year in over a decade." The 524 figure through Feb 10 already exceeded all prior Jan-Feb records (2016: 416, 2025: 219).

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Crete capsizing (Feb 21-22)**: At least 5 dead, ~20 missing. This adds to the toll but is relatively small in absolute terms.

- **Five bodies in Libya (Feb 22)**: Small addition, but confirms continued mortality.

- **Cyclone Harry cluster**: Italian authorities and NGOs estimate ~380+ people missing from Jan 14-21. If even partially incorporated into IOM data before March 1, this could substantially close the gap.

**Weak evidence:**
- **"~1,000 migrants missing" from Cyclone Harry** (Giornale di Sicilia): NGO estimate, not IOM-confirmed. Speculative for resolution purposes.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question resolves March 1, 2026, covering Jan 1–Feb 28 (59 days). Today is Feb 22, leaving 6 days.

Key trajectory:
- 375 dead by end of January
- 484 by Feb 10 (53 added in ~4 days from Zuwara)
- 524 by Feb 10 (Le Monde figure, possibly slightly different dataset)
- 567 by Feb 20 (AFP/IOM figure)

From Feb 20 to Feb 28 = 8 days. At the Feb 10-20 rate (4.3/day): +34 → ~601. At the January rate (12/day): +96 → ~663. Neither reaches 800 through new incidents alone.

**If timeframe halved** (question resolved Feb 22 instead of March 1): Probability drops dramatically—current confirmed figure is ~567-600, well below 800.

**If timeframe doubled** (question resolved March 15): Probability increases significantly—more time for new incidents AND retroactive IOM data revisions.

The critical question is whether IOM retroactively revises its dataset to incorporate the Cyclone Harry cluster before March 1. This is the pivotal uncertainty.

**(d) Justification**

The confirmed IOM figure of 567 by Feb 20 is the anchor. The gap to 800 is 233 deaths. With 8 days remaining (Feb 21-28), new incidents at observed rates would add ~35-96 deaths, reaching 602-663. This falls significantly short of 800.

**Factors pushing toward YES:**
1. IOM's acknowledged massive undercounting (strong evidence): The Cyclone Harry cluster alone could add hundreds to the official count retroactively. If IOM revises January figures from 375 to, say, 600+, the total would easily exceed 800.
2. Ongoing incidents (Feb 21-22 Crete, Libya bodies): Adding incrementally.
3. Record pace of 2026 suggests continued high mortality.

**Factors pushing toward NO:**
1. The mathematical gap is large: 233 deaths needed in 8 days, while observed rate suggests only 35-96 new deaths.
2. IOM data revisions may not occur before March 1 resolution date—the dataset is queried at a specific point in time.
3. The 567 figure (Feb 20) already incorporates some revisions; further large retroactive additions may not happen quickly.
4. IOM's January figure of 375 has been stable across multiple sources—if major Cyclone Harry revisions were coming, they might have already appeared.

The outside view base rate of 55% was calibrated on uncertainty about IOM retroactive revisions. The new AFP/IOM figure of 567 by Feb 20 is a significant update—it confirms the confirmed floor is higher than the 533 figure used in the outside view, but the gap to 800 remains substantial (233 deaths in 8 days).

The key insight: the 567 figure is described as deaths "in the central Mediterranean" specifically. The resolution criteria asks for "Mediterranean" broadly (which includes eastern and western routes). If the 567 figure is central Mediterranean only, the full Mediterranean total could be higher. However, the Le Monde figure of 524 through Feb 10 appears to be all Mediterranean routes, while the 567 figure from AFP may be central Mediterranean only. This ambiguity could mean the actual Mediterranean-wide total is higher than 567.

Given the substantial gap to 800, the short remaining timeframe, and the uncertainty about IOM retroactive revisions happening before March 1, I'll adjust downward from 55% to approximately 35-40%.

Probability Calibration:

Starting from 55% outside view:
- Confirmed 567 deaths by Feb 20 (higher than assumed 533 floor): slight upward adjustment
- Gap of 233 deaths in 8 days at observed rates (35-96 new deaths): significant downward adjustment
- IOM retroactive revision uncertainty (could add hundreds but timing uncertain): moderate upward adjustment
- Cyclone Harry cluster may already be partially incorporated in the 375 January figure: slight downward adjustment
- Mediterranean-wide vs. central Mediterranean ambiguity could mean total is higher: slight upward adjustment

Net adjustment: -15 to -20 percentage points from 55% → approximately 35-40%

I'll settle on **38%** as my inside view prediction.

Checklist:

1. **Resolution criteria**: IOM Missing Migrants Project dataset shows ≥800 dead+missing in Mediterranean through end of February 2026. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate**: 55%, reflecting uncertainty about IOM retroactive revisions vs. mathematical gap to 800. My final 38% is lower, justified by the confirmed 567 figure (Feb 20) leaving a 233-death gap with only 8 days remaining at observed rates of 35-96 new deaths. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "38 out of 100 times, IOM records ≥800 Mediterranean deaths by end of February 2026." This makes sense—plausible but unlikely given the mathematical gap and short timeframe. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - IOM confirmed 567 deaths by Feb 20 (AFP/IOM, high credibility) ✓
   - Gap of 233 deaths in 8 days; observed rate suggests only 35-96 new deaths ✓
   - IOM acknowledges massive undercounting from Cyclone Harry cluster ✓
   - IOM retroactive revisions may not occur before March 1 resolution ✓
   - Record-breaking 2026 pace confirmed by IOM spokesperson ✓

5. **Blind spot**: If IOM makes a large retroactive revision to incorporate the Cyclone Harry cluster (potentially adding 200-400 deaths to January figures) before March 1, the question resolves YES easily. This scenario would make my 38% look too low. Probability of this scenario: ~20-25%.

6. **Status quo**: Current confirmed figure is ~567-600. Status quo (no major retroactive revision) results in NO. The world changes slowly—IOM data revisions of this magnitude within 8 days are possible but not certain.

Probability: 38%
