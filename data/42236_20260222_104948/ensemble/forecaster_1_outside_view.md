Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Le Monde (Feb 12, 2026)**: Paywalled but partially accessible. Reports 524 dead/missing Jan 1–Feb 10, 2026, citing IOM directly. Quotes IOM spokesperson calling it "the worst start to a year we have seen in over a decade." High-quality source, credible IOM attribution. Factual data point: 524 deaths through Feb 10.

**Al Jazeera (Feb 22, 2026)**: Reports ongoing incidents as of the question opening date. Notes 375 dead/missing in January alone (central Mediterranean), 53 dead from Feb 6 Zuwara capsizing. High-quality outlet, cites IOM data. Published on the question's opening date, making it the most current source.

**The Guardian (Feb 9, 2026)**: Reports the 53-death Zuwara incident, IOM statements about trafficking networks and undercounting. Reliable outlet, IOM-sourced data. Factual: 53 dead from one incident, IOM fears "hundreds" have died since start of 2026.

**UN News (Feb 9, 2026)**: Official UN outlet reporting same Zuwara incident. Confirms 375 dead/missing in January alone (central Med). High credibility. Factual: 375 January deaths, 53 from Feb 6 incident.

**BBC (Feb 9, 2026)**: Reports "nearly 500 migrants dead or missing" from Libya routes as of Feb 9. Consistent with other sources. High credibility.

**Agent Report**: Synthesizes multiple sources, estimates 533 confirmed deaths by Feb 16, projects trajectory. Notes IOM acknowledged undercounting. The Cyclone Harry claim (~380 deaths in one week) appears to be from Italian authorities' estimates rather than confirmed IOM data—this should be treated cautiously. The agent's probability estimate of 75–85% is reasonable but requires scrutiny.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes apply:

1. **Historical Jan–Feb Mediterranean death tolls**: 2015 (~427), 2016 (~416), 2025 (~219). The 2026 pace (533 by Feb 16) already exceeds all prior Jan–Feb records. This reference class suggests the question is whether 2026 continues its unprecedented pace.

2. **Full-year Mediterranean death totals**: 2025: 1,873; 2024: 2,452; 2016: 5,136. These suggest 800 deaths in 2 months is achievable but historically exceptional.

3. **IOM data revision patterns**: IOM explicitly acknowledges undercounting due to "invisible shipwrecks." Historical revisions tend to push numbers upward. This reference class suggests the 533 figure (as of Feb 16) is a floor.

The most suitable reference class is #1 (historical Jan–Feb totals) combined with #3 (IOM undercounting patterns), as these directly address the resolution criteria.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question resolves March 1, 2026, covering Jan 1–Feb 28, 2026 (59 days total). As of Feb 22 (today), we are 7 days from resolution.

Key data points:
- 533 confirmed deaths by Feb 16 (47 days elapsed)
- Average rate: ~11.3 deaths/day
- Remaining days: Feb 17–28 = 12 days
- At 11.3/day: 533 + (12 × 11.3) = 533 + 136 = ~669 (below 800)
- Gap to 800: 267 additional deaths needed in 12 days = ~22.3/day required

However, IOM data is subject to retroactive upward revision. The Cyclone Harry cluster (late January) may not be fully incorporated. The agent report notes Italian authorities estimated ~380 deaths in one week from that cluster, while IOM's January figure was only 375 for the entire month—suggesting significant undercounting may exist.

Additionally, the Al Jazeera article from Feb 22 (today) reports ongoing incidents (8 bodies found, ~50-person boat capsized off Crete with ~30 still missing). These continue to add to the toll.

**(d) Justification**

The confirmed floor of 533 deaths by Feb 16 is well-documented. To reach 800 by Feb 28, approximately 267 more deaths need to be recorded in 12 days. At the observed pace of ~11.3/day, this would require roughly doubling the rate, which seems unlikely based on new incidents alone.

However, three factors push toward YES:
1. **IOM undercounting**: The agency explicitly acknowledges "hundreds more deaths believed unrecorded." If even partial retroactive additions are made, the gap narrows significantly.
2. **Cyclone Harry cluster**: If Italian estimates of ~380 late-January deaths are eventually incorporated into IOM data, the January figure could be revised substantially upward from 375.
3. **Ongoing February incidents**: The Feb 22 Al Jazeera article confirms continued deaths, adding to the total.

The critical uncertainty is whether IOM's *official dataset* (as queried for resolution) will reflect these revisions before March 1. IOM data updates can lag incidents by days to weeks.

The trajectory at face value (533 → ~669 by Feb 28) falls short of 800. But given IOM's acknowledged undercounting and the extraordinary pace of 2026, there's meaningful probability that the official dataset will show ≥800 through retroactive additions and late-February incidents.

Outside view calibration:

The confirmed 533 figure as of Feb 16 represents a floor. The gap to 800 is 267 deaths over 12 remaining days. At observed rates, this is unlikely to be reached through new incidents alone (~136 additional at current pace). However:

- IOM undercounting is explicitly acknowledged and historically significant
- The Cyclone Harry cluster represents a potential large retroactive addition
- Ongoing incidents (Feb 22 article confirms continued deaths)
- The question asks about the dataset "through end of February 2026" — if IOM updates data retroactively before March 1, this could resolve YES

The base rate of "unprecedented death tolls continuing at record pace" combined with IOM's acknowledged undercounting suggests perhaps 40–55% probability. The agent's 75–85% estimate seems too high given the mathematical gap (267 deaths needed vs. ~136 projected at current pace). But undercounting could easily add 100–200+ deaths retroactively.

I'll estimate approximately 55% probability, reflecting genuine uncertainty about whether IOM's official dataset will show ≥800 by the resolution date, given the significant gap between confirmed figures and the threshold, partially offset by acknowledged undercounting and ongoing incidents.
