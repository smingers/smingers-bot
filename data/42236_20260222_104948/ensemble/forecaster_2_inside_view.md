Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Le Monde, 12 Feb 2026** – Major French newspaper of record. Factual: IOM-confirmed 524 Mediterranean dead/missing Jan 1–Feb 10, 2026; IOM spokesperson quoted directly calling it "worst start to a year in over a decade." High reliability. 12 days old at time of analysis.

2. **Al Jazeera, 22 Feb 2026** – Reputable international broadcaster. Factual: Five bodies Libya, three bodies Greece (Feb 21 Crete capsizing), repeats IOM Jan 2026 figure of ≥375. Minimal opinion. High reliability, dated today.

3. **AFP via middleeastmonitor.com, 10 Feb 2026** – Wire service (AFP) is highly reliable. Factual: 53 dead/missing from Feb 6 Zuwara wreck; total at least 484 by Feb 10. High reliability.

4. **UN News, 9 Feb 2026** – Official UN/IOM outlet. Factual: 53 deaths Zuwara wreck; ≥375 January deaths; 781 migrants intercepted/returned to Libya in 2026. Very high reliability.

5. **AFP via migrant charities article, 20 Feb 2026** – Wire service. Factual: IOM reported at least 567 migrant lives lost in central Mediterranean so far in 2026 (as of ~Feb 20). High reliability. This is the most recent IOM-sourced figure.

6. **Giornale di Sicilia, 20 Feb 2026** – Italian regional newspaper. Factual: ~1,000 migrants reportedly missing from Cyclone Harry boats (Jan 14–21); bodies washing ashore Sicily/Calabria. Moderate reliability (regional, citing NGO estimates).

7. **Multiple sources (Feb 21–22, 2026)** – AFP, Daijiworld, YesPunjab, VRT, Notizie.it – All report Crete capsizing: 5 confirmed dead, ~20 missing, ~50 aboard. High reliability (AFP-sourced).

8. **IOM/Euronews/Free Malaysia Today, 26 Jan 2026** – IOM warning of hundreds feared dead from Jan 14–25 shipwrecks; 104 confirmed/feared dead from three wrecks; 380 people from nine boats missing. Very high reliability.

**Key factual data points:**
- Jan 2026: ≥375 dead/missing (IOM)
- Feb 6 Zuwara wreck: +53 → total ≥484 by Feb 10
- By ~Feb 20: IOM-reported total ≥567 (AFP article)
- Feb 21 Crete: +5 confirmed dead, ~20 missing
- Feb 22 Libya: +5 bodies
- Additional ongoing incidents

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **IOM figure of ≥567 by ~Feb 20** (AFP, 20 Feb): This is a direct IOM data point from the primary resolution source, 9 days before resolution. The gap to 800 is ~233 deaths in the remaining ~8 days (Feb 20–28). This is the most critical data point.
- **Cyclone Harry "ghost shipwrecks"**: Multiple independent sources (Mediterranea, Alarm Phone, Mem.Med, IOM) confirm ~1,000 migrants departed in 10+ boats Jan 14–21; fate of most unknown. IOM has warned hundreds may be unrecorded. These deaths could be added to the database before March 1 as investigations conclude. This is a structural data-revision risk.
- **Historical pace**: Jan 2026 pace was ~12/day (375/31), far exceeding historical norms. Feb pace through Feb 20 was ~(567-375)/20 = ~9.6/day. If this pace continued through Feb 28, that adds ~77 more: 567 + 77 = ~644. Still short of 800.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Feb 21 Crete incident**: 5 confirmed dead + ~20 missing. If all 20 missing are eventually recorded, that's +25. But IOM typically records confirmed dead/missing separately; not all "missing" become recorded deaths immediately.
- **Feb 22 Libya bodies**: +5 more. Small increment.
- **NGO estimates of ~1,000 missing** from Cyclone Harry boats: If even 200–300 of these are formally recorded by IOM before March 1, the total could spike significantly. However, IOM is conservative and verification takes time.

**Weak evidence:**
- **"2026 could be deadliest year" framing**: Opinion from IOM spokesperson and media, not a specific data point for the resolution window.
- **Ongoing search operations**: Suggest more deaths may be found, but timing of IOM recording is uncertain.

**Gap analysis:**
- Current IOM total (as of ~Feb 20): ≥567
- Needed: 800
- Gap: ~233
- Days remaining (Feb 20–28): ~8 days
- Required daily pace to close gap: ~29/day
- Observed recent pace: ~9.6/day (Feb 1–20)
- To reach 800, pace would need to triple, OR a major data revision incorporating the Cyclone Harry "ghost shipwrecks" (potentially 200-400 deaths) would need to be formally recorded before March 1.

The Cyclone Harry scenario is the key uncertainty. If IOM formally records 200+ of the ~1,000 reportedly missing migrants from Jan 14–21 before March 1, the total could reach 800. However:
- IOM has been warning about these deaths since Jan 26 but has not yet fully incorporated them (the Feb 20 figure of 567 is already 25+ days after the events)
- IOM's conservative verification process means many "ghost shipwreck" deaths may not be formally recorded for months
- The 567 figure may already include some partial Cyclone Harry counts

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

Resolution is March 1, 2026 – approximately 7 days from today (Feb 22). The question asks about deaths recorded by end of February.

- **If timeframe halved (3.5 days)**: Probability drops significantly, as even less time for data revisions or new incidents to push the total to 800. Perhaps 5-8%.
- **If timeframe doubled (14 days, mid-March)**: Probability rises substantially, as more time for both new incidents and data revisions. Perhaps 25-35%.

The 7-day window is tight. The primary path to resolution is a large data revision incorporating Cyclone Harry deaths, not new incidents in the remaining week.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting point**: Outside view base rate of 11% (historical reference class: 0/11 years reached 800 by end-Feb, Laplace-smoothed to ~7-11%).

**Upward adjustments:**
1. Current pace is unprecedented: 567 deaths by Feb 20 vs. 219 for all of Jan-Feb 2025. The 2026 pace is roughly 2.6x the 2025 pace. This is a genuine structural break from the reference class.
2. Cyclone Harry "ghost shipwrecks": IOM has explicitly warned of potentially hundreds of unrecorded deaths. If even a fraction are formally added before March 1, the total could spike. The NGO estimate of ~1,000 missing is extreme, but even 200 formal additions would close most of the gap.
3. The IOM figure of 567 (Feb 20) already represents a historically unprecedented pace.

**Downward adjustments:**
1. The gap remains large: ~233 deaths needed in 7 days at a pace of ~33/day vs. observed ~10/day.
2. IOM's verification process is slow and conservative. The Cyclone Harry deaths have been known since late January but only partially incorporated 25+ days later.
3. Even in 2016 (deadliest year), the Jan-Feb total was ~450, well below 800.
4. The 567 figure may already include some Cyclone Harry partial counts, limiting further revision.

**Net assessment**: The unprecedented scale of 2026 deaths and the unresolved Cyclone Harry "ghost shipwreck" question create genuine uncertainty. However, the gap of ~233 deaths in 7 days is large, and IOM's conservative verification process makes a sudden data surge unlikely but not impossible. I adjust upward from the 11% base rate to approximately 18-22%, reflecting:
- The structural break from historical norms (2.6x pace)
- The real but uncertain possibility of Cyclone Harry data revision
- The practical constraint of IOM's slow verification process
- The short remaining timeframe

**Probability Calibration**

The key question is: will IOM formally record ~233 more Mediterranean deaths before March 1, 2026?

Scenarios:
1. **Status quo pace continues** (~10/day): +70 deaths → total ~637. No resolution. Probability: ~50% weight.
2. **Moderate data revision** (Cyclone Harry adds 100-200): Total ~667-767. Still likely no resolution. Probability: ~30% weight.
3. **Large data revision** (Cyclone Harry adds 200-300+): Total ~767-867. Resolution possible. Probability: ~15% weight → conditional resolution probability ~50% → contributes ~7.5%.
4. **Major new incident + data revision**: Total exceeds 800. Probability: ~5% weight → conditional resolution probability ~80% → contributes ~4%.

Weighted probability: ~0% (scenario 1) + ~0% (scenario 2) + 7.5% (scenario 3) + 4% (scenario 4) = ~11.5%

But I should also account for the possibility that the IOM database has already been updated beyond 567 (the Feb 20 figure) and is closer to 700+ by now (Feb 22), given the ongoing Crete and Libya incidents. If the true current figure is ~600-650, the gap is smaller (~150-200), making resolution somewhat more likely.

Adjusting upward slightly: **~18%**

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will IOM MMP show ≥800 Mediterranean dead+missing for Jan 1–Feb 28, 2026? Yes, this aligns with the resolution criteria.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 11% (0/11 historical years, Laplace-smoothed). My final prediction of 18% reflects a meaningful but not dramatic upward shift given unprecedented 2026 pace and Cyclone Harry uncertainty.

3. **Consistency check**: "18 out of 100 times, IOM records ≥800 Mediterranean deaths by end of February 2026." This makes sense given the unprecedented pace but large remaining gap.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - IOM figure of ≥567 by Feb 20 (strong; leaves 233-death gap)
   - Cyclone Harry ~1,000 missing migrants, partially unrecorded (moderate; could trigger data revision)
   - Feb 21 Crete: 5 dead + 20 missing (moderate; adds incrementally)
   - Historical pace: 2.6x above 2025 (strong; structural break from reference class)
   - IOM conservative verification process (strong; limits rapid data additions)

5. **Blind spot**: If IOM has already incorporated a large batch of Cyclone Harry deaths in the last 2 days (Feb 20-22) and the current total is already ~700+, resolution becomes much more likely (~40-50%). This scenario could make my 18% look too low.

6. **Status quo**: Current pace of ~10/day would yield ~637 by Feb 28. Status quo = No resolution. This anchors toward lower probability.

Probability: 18%
