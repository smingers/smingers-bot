Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Le Monde (Feb 12, 2026)**: Reports 524 migrants dead/missing Jan 1–Feb 10, 2026. Cites IOM directly. Partially paywalled but key statistics are accessible. High-quality source with direct IOM attribution. The IOM spokesperson quote is expert opinion from an identifiable entity.

**Al Jazeera (Feb 22, 2026)**: Reports ongoing incidents including 5 bodies in Libya, 3 bodies + 20 rescued off Crete. References January 2026 IOM data showing 375 dead/missing in central Mediterranean. Published on today's date (Feb 22). High-quality source, factual reporting.

**The Guardian (Feb 9, 2026)**: Reports 53 dead/missing from Feb 5 capsizing near Zuwara, Libya. IOM statements about trafficking networks and hundreds feared dead since start of 2026. Reputable source with IOM attribution.

**UN News (Feb 9, 2026)**: Confirms 53 deaths from Zuwara incident, 375 dead/missing in January 2026 alone in central Mediterranean. Official UN source - very high credibility. Directly relevant statistics.

**BBC (Feb 9, 2026)**: Confirms same Zuwara incident, reports "nearly 500 migrants dead or missing" in Mediterranean from Libya as of Feb 9. Reputable source.

**Agent Report**: Synthesizes multiple sources, estimates ≥533 dead/missing as of Feb 16, 2026. Includes trajectory analysis projecting 680–720 by Feb 28 at average rates, but notes significant undercounting. The agent's probability estimate of 75–85% is reasonable given the analysis.

Key factual anchors from credible sources:
- January 2026: ≥375 dead/missing (central Mediterranean, IOM)
- Feb 1–10: ~149 additional deaths (524 total by Feb 10, Le Monde/IOM)
- Feb 10–16: ~9 additional deaths (533 total by Feb 16, The Independent)
- Feb 16–22 (today): Unknown additional deaths, but Al Jazeera reports ongoing incidents

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are possible:

1. **Historical Jan–Feb Mediterranean death tolls**: 2015 (~427), 2016 (~416), 2025 (~219). 2026 at 524 by Feb 10 is unprecedented. This reference class shows 2026 is an extreme outlier on the high end.

2. **Years with high early-year Mediterranean deaths**: 2016 full year was 5,136 (deadliest). The 2016 Jan–Feb figure of ~416 is far below 2026's pace.

3. **Probability of reaching a threshold given current pace**: At 533 by Feb 16, need 267 more in 12 days. Daily rate Feb 1–16 was ~9.9/day. At that rate: 12 × 9.9 = ~119, giving total ~652. At January's rate (12.1/day): ~145 more, total ~678. Both fall short of 800 at current confirmed rates.

The most suitable reference class is the **trajectory-based projection** combined with the **undercounting adjustment**. The IOM explicitly acknowledges significant undercounting, and the Cyclone Harry cluster (estimated 380 deaths in late January by Italian authorities) may not be fully reflected in the Feb 16 figure of 533.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question resolves March 1, 2026. Today is Feb 22, meaning we are essentially at the end of the resolution window (6 days remain). The question asks about deaths recorded "through end of February 2026."

Key consideration: The IOM dataset is updated as incidents are verified. The 533 figure as of Feb 16 is a confirmed floor. Between Feb 16–22 (today), additional incidents have occurred (Al Jazeera reports 8 more bodies today). The question is whether the dataset will show ≥800 by the time it's queried.

Historical patterns: Mediterranean deaths are not uniformly distributed. January 2026 was particularly deadly (375 in 31 days = 12.1/day). February appears slower in confirmed data (~9.9/day confirmed), but undercounting is acknowledged.

**(d) Justification**

The confirmed figure of ≥533 as of Feb 16 leaves a gap of 267 to reach 800. With ~12 days remaining (Feb 17–28), the average daily rate needed is ~22/day, which is roughly double the confirmed February rate of ~9.9/day.

However, three factors push toward YES:

1. **Undercounting**: IOM explicitly states "hundreds more deaths believed unrecorded." The Cyclone Harry cluster (Italian authorities estimated ~380 deaths in late January) may not be fully incorporated. If even 100-150 additional deaths from this cluster get added retroactively, the gap narrows significantly.

2. **Ongoing incidents**: Al Jazeera (Feb 22) reports fresh incidents today. The pace hasn't stopped.

3. **Data revision**: IOM datasets are updated as investigations conclude. The "invisible shipwrecks" phenomenon means real-time figures systematically undercount.

Against YES:
- The mathematical gap is substantial: need ~267 more in ~12 days when confirmed rate suggests ~120-145
- Even with undercounting adjustments, reaching 800 requires the unrecorded deaths to be very large
- The question asks about the IOM MMP dataset specifically, which may lag reality

The agent's estimate of 75-85% seems slightly high given the mathematical gap. The confirmed pace projects to ~650-680 by Feb 28. To reach 800, the dataset would need to incorporate an additional ~120-150 deaths beyond what the current pace suggests—plausible given the Cyclone Harry undercounting, but not certain.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for this specific threshold (800 Mediterranean deaths in Jan–Feb) has never been reached before in IOM's recording history (previous record ~427 in 2015). However, 2026 is already at 533 confirmed by Feb 16, making this year categorically different.

The key tension: confirmed pace projects ~650-680, but undercounting could push the official figure to 800+. The IOM's own acknowledgment of "hundreds more unrecorded" is significant. If even 150 of those unrecorded deaths get added to the dataset before resolution, the threshold is met.

Given:
- 533 confirmed by Feb 16 (floor)
- ~267 gap to 800
- ~12 days remaining with confirmed rate of ~10/day = ~120 additional
- Undercounting factor could add 100-200 more
- Probability that undercounting + remaining days pushes total to 800: moderate-to-high

I estimate the probability at approximately 68%. The mathematical gap is real but the undercounting factor is substantial and explicitly acknowledged by IOM. The question is whether the official dataset captures enough of the unrecorded deaths before March 1.

Outside View Prediction:
68%
