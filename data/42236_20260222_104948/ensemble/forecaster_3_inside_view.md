Analysis:
**1) Paraphrase / what resolves**
This resolves **Yes** if the IOM Missing Migrants Project dataset shows **≥800 dead+missing in the “Mediterranean” region** for **2026 year-to-date through Feb 28, 2026** (checked by Mar 1, 2026).

*Note on a potential ambiguity:* the generic tournament note says events before the forecast opening date “do not count,” but the explicit resolution rule uses **2026 year-to-date through end of February**. I assume the explicit YTD criterion governs (otherwise the question becomes internally inconsistent with the cited IOM YTD figures).

## (a) Source analysis (what each says + quality/date)

**Le Monde (Feb 12, 2026; partially paywalled)**  
- *Factual:* Cites IOM that **Jan 1–Feb 10 = 524** dead/missing across Mediterranean routes; compares to prior years.  
- *Opinion:* IOM spokesperson: “worst start…deadliest” (credible expert/entity opinion).  
- *Quality:* High; data attributed to IOM. Date is recent but 12 days old.

**UN News (Feb 9, 2026)**  
- *Factual:* Confirms **53 dead/missing** off Zuwara; reiterates **375 dead/missing in January** in central Mediterranean; discusses returns to Libya.  
- *Quality:* Very high credibility (UN/IOM). Date: mid-February.

**Al Jazeera (Feb 22, 2026)**  
- *Factual:* Reports new recoveries (5 bodies Libya; 3+ dead off Crete) and references IOM statements about January’s high toll and “invisible shipwrecks.”  
- *Quality:* High for incident reporting; casualty totals largely sourced back to IOM. Date: today.

**AFP (AskNews items; Feb 20–22, 2026)**  
- *Factual, key:* One AFP piece reports IOM said **at least 567 lives lost in the central Mediterranean so far in 2026** (as of Feb 20). Other AFP pieces report Crete capsize deaths/missing.  
- *Quality:* High (wire service), and the “567” figure is critical because it is a direct IOM statistic. Date: very recent.

**Other AskNews reprints (YesPunjab, Daijiworld, vrt, Notizie.it, etc.; Feb 21–22)**  
- *Factual:* Mostly re-report the Crete incident; some include uncertain/variable counts of missing.  
- *Quality:* Mixed/secondary; I treat as confirmatory only where consistent with coast guard/AFP.

**NGO/advocacy articles (e.g., L’Eco di Bergamo; Noticias ao Minuto; Giornale di Sicilia; Feb 20–21)**  
- *Factual claims:* discuss “Cyclone Harry,” bodies washing ashore, and claims of ~380 to ~1,000 missing.  
- *Quality:* Moderate-to-weak for precise numbers unless clearly tied to IOM; some figures appear to be NGO estimates and may not translate into IOM incident-dataset entries quickly.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

### Strong evidence
1) **IOM-attributed cumulative totals already extremely high**  
- Le Monde/IOM: **524 by Feb 10** (Mediterranean all routes).  
- AFP/IOM: **567 in central Mediterranean by Feb 20** (central only; Mediterranean total should be ≥ this).  
**Why strong:** direct from IOM (the resolving dataset owner), multiple reputable outlets.

2) **Mechanism for late additions exists (missing/“invisible” shipwrecks)**  
- IOM repeatedly warns of unrecorded/late-verified incidents; storms and “ghost shipwrecks” lead to later counting.  
**Why strong:** structural feature of the dataset—verification lags are real and recurring.

### Moderate evidence
3) **Recent incidents (Crete capsize; bodies in Libya/Italy)** add incremental deaths/missing  
- Likely adds **tens**, not hundreds, unless a large “missing boat” incident is entered with high estimated fatalities.  
**Why moderate:** credible incidents, but magnitude likely too small alone.

4) **Cyclone Harry / Tunisia departures narrative suggests large missing counts**  
- Multiple reports of many boats departing, many not arriving; IOM investigating (as of late Jan).  
**Why moderate:** plausible driver of large totals, but uncertain whether/when the IOM public incident dataset will reflect the high-end estimates.

### Weak evidence
5) **High-end NGO claims (e.g., “~1,000 missing”)**  
**Why weak:** may be advocacy estimates; not necessarily adopted into IOM dataset before Mar 1.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- From **today (Feb 22)** to the end-of-February cutoff is **7 days** (and resolution on Mar 1).  
- If the remaining time were **halved (~3–4 days)**, probability drops because hitting 800 would rely even more on **retroactive dataset additions** rather than new incidents.  
- If time were **doubled (~14 days; to mid-March)**, probability rises materially because both (i) additional crossings/incidents and (ii) verification/backfilling would have more time to appear in the dataset.

---

## (d) Justification: updating the outside view
**Outside view base rate (given): 68%** (based on unprecedented early-2026 levels plus plausible undercount/backfill).

**Status-quo trend check (if nothing “big” changes):**  
- We have strong evidence for **~524 by Feb 10** and another strong IOM datapoint of **567 central Med by Feb 20**.  
- But to reach **800 by Feb 28**, we likely need roughly **+150 to +230** more than the Feb 20-ish level, depending on the current all-Mediterranean total.  
- In only 7 days, “normal” incremental additions (a few incidents) probably won’t sum to 200+. That points to **No** *unless* a large missing-boat episode is formally recorded/updated in the dataset before Mar 1.

**What shifts me from 68% downwards:**  
- **Short runway**: only 7 days left; needing a large jump makes the forecast hinge on an administrative/verification event (dataset backfill) rather than the steady incident rate.  
- **Central-vs-total nuance**: the “567 central” figure is huge, but still not close enough by itself; without a big retroactive addition, the total may finish in the **600–750** range rather than ≥800.

**What keeps probability from dropping too far:**  
- IOM itself has been discussing large-scale “invisible shipwrecks” and missing boats since January; if one or more high-fatality “missing boat” incidents are entered with estimated passenger counts, **crossing 800 is entirely plausible quickly**.

Net: I move from “moderately likely Yes” to **roughly coin-flip**, because the remaining gap is large relative to time left and depends on whether IOM records a major missing-boat tranche into the public dataset before Mar 1.

---

Probability calibration
- **If current trend continues without major backfilled incidents:** likely ends **below 800** (my central expectation).  
- **If IOM adds one large missing-boat incident set (order 150–300+) before Mar 1:** likely **Yes**.  
- I estimate the chance of that kind of dataset jump in the next week as substantial but not dominant.

**Inside-view probability: 54%** (a ±10% change feels meaningful here; 44% would imply I think big backfills are unlikely in a week, 64% would imply I think they’re more likely than not).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Yes if IOM MMP shows **≥800 Mediterranean dead+missing** in **2026 YTD through Feb 28**.
2. Outside view base rate: **68%**.
3. Consistency check: **54 out of 100 times**, IOM’s dataset will show ≥800 by end-Feb 2026.
4. Key evidence (most important):
   - IOM-cited total **524 by Feb 10** (Le Monde citing IOM).
   - IOM-cited total **567 central Med by Feb 20** (AFP citing IOM).
   - Only **7 days** remain; reaching 800 likely needs **major retroactive/backfilled entries**.
   - IOM repeatedly notes **“invisible shipwrecks”** and likely undercounting/late verification.
5. Blind spot (most likely to make me look silly): IOM publishes/updates a large set of January “missing boats” (Cyclone Harry) into the dataset before Mar 1, pushing totals well past 800 → would raise probability sharply (to ~75–90%).
6. Status quo outcome: absent a major update/backfill, the dataset likely remains below 800 → nudges me toward No relative to the outside-view.

Probability: 54%
