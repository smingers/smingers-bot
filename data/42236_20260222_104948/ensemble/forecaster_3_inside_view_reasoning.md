**Interpreting YTD criteria**

I need to interpret the question correctly about the IOM dataset at the end of February 2026. Since forecasting opened on February 22, they specify that events before this date won't count. Yet, the resolution criterion uses a year-to-date sum, including January. So, I need to align with the instructions that state events before the opening don’t count toward resolution, which seems to imply focusing on incidents from February 22 onward. This doesn't seem entirely consistent with the year-to-date term used.**Clarifying year-to-date expectations**

It seems that although the note about the year-to-date sum may be generic, I need to adhere to the specific criteria mentioned, which states "year-to-date sum through end Feb 2026 must be at least 800." This implies that data from January 1 to February 28 counts. Currently, data shows over 524 by February 10, and the IOM reported at least 567 in the central Mediterranean by February 20. However, the term "Mediterranean" covers various regions, so I need to ensure that the total meets the required 800 by February 28, which means I need an additional 233 deaths.**Estimating incident totals**

The IOM has recorded 375 deaths in January and 524 by February 10 across all routes. By February 20, the total may be around 600-650. To hit the required count, they will need an additional 150-200 deaths in the last week. It's possible if they retroactively include storm incidents. New info from AFP indicates there were 567 deaths in the central Mediterranean, suggesting we're closer but still need 233 by February 28, requiring a daily rate of 33. This looks unlikely unless large backlogs or significant incidents get recorded.**Assessing missing incidents**

Many sources report 380 missing individuals, and the IOM has been investigating this since they mentioned 380 missing from nine boats by January 26, though it's not yet confirmed. They usually categorize "dead" and "missing" together, so if the IOM believes 380 are missing, they might record them. The dataset could update after the end of February, which is crucial since my question hinges on the year-to-date total. Le Monde indicated 524 deaths by February 10 which could include those missing from earlier incidents.**Evaluating missing data and probabilities**

The IOM reported at least 375 dead or missing in January 2026 in the central Mediterranean, but I noticed that this figure might not include the previously mentioned 380 missing from multiple shipwrecks. It’s confusing that the 380 figure might still be unverified, while later reports claim 567 deaths by February 20. With just a week left in February, any updates could help, but significant records will depend on if they include data from earlier incidents. I feel the probability of reaching that total could be around 45% to 55%.
