Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; what’s fact vs opinion)

- **Le Monde (Feb 12, 2026; paywalled excerpt)**  
  - **Factual claims (attributed to IOM):** 524 dead or missing in the Mediterranean from **Jan 1–Feb 10, 2026**; comparison points: **219** over same period in 2025 and **416** in 2016.  
  - **Opinion/interpretation:** “unprecedented toll,” “worst start … in over a decade” (quote attributed to an IOM spokesperson—credible expert voice).  
  - **Quality:** High-quality outlet; but paywall limits verification of full context. Still, the key numbers are explicitly attributed to IOM.

- **Al Jazeera (Feb 22, 2026)**  
  - **Factual claims:** reports specific recovered bodies (Libya, Greece) and cites IOM figures (e.g., January 2026 central Med deaths; the Zuwara incident).  
  - **Quality:** Generally solid for incident reporting; some details (numbers aboard, expected bodies) can be fluid early on. Useful mainly as secondary reporting of IOM counts and near-real-time events.

- **The Guardian (Feb 9, 2026)**  
  - **Factual claims:** 53 dead or missing in a specific capsizing; cites IOM historical totals and warnings.  
  - **Quality:** High for journalism; incident counts are credible but can later be revised.

- **UN News (Feb 9, 2026)**  
  - **Factual claims:** repeats the 53-deaths incident; cites IOM Missing Migrants database figures (e.g., January central Med deaths).  
  - **Quality:** Very high for attributable institutional claims; tends to be conservative and sourceable.

- **BBC (Feb 9, 2026)**  
  - **Factual claims:** same shipwreck; cites IOM: “nearly 500” dead/missing from Libya so far in 2026; January = 375 in central Med.  
  - **Quality:** Very high; cautious language; good for anchoring base facts.

- **Agent report (undated compilation; mixes sources; claims it queried dataset but then cites media)**  
  - **Factual content:** provides a stitched timeline of reported totals (524 by Feb 10; 533 by Feb 16) and older-year comparators (2015 ~427, 2025 ~219, 2016 ~416—though not cleanly “end of Feb”).  
  - **Lower-confidence elements:** mentions “Cyclone Harry” and large estimated death clusters and asserts possible delayed inclusion in the dataset—these may be real but are not validated with direct dataset extracts in the report as written.  
  - **Quality:** Medium. Useful as a pointer to numbers, but not a primary dataset pull; treat the more dramatic claims (large backfills) with skepticism.

**Important note for “outside view”**: several sources describe *2026’s* already-high early-year toll. That information is highly relevant for an *inside view*, but an *outside view* baseline should primarily come from the historical distribution of Jan–Feb totals across prior years.

### (b) Reference class analysis (candidate base-rate classes)

1. **Mediterranean migrant dead+missing recorded by IOM, Jan 1–end of Feb, for years 2014–2025**  
   - **Best match** to the question definition (same geography, same metric, same season).  
   - From the provided historical comparisons: early-year tallies like **~219 (2025)** and **~416–427 (2016/2015)** suggest a typical range well below 800.

2. **Mediterranean annual totals (2014–2025) and the share occurring by end of Feb**  
   - Helpful to sanity-check whether 800 by end-Feb is plausible relative to annual totals. Even in the deadliest modern year (2016: ~5,136 full-year), the cited early-year toll (~416 by Feb 10) implies that reaching 800 by end-Feb would be an extreme front-loading.

3. **Winter (Jan–Feb) central Mediterranean only (a subset route)**  
   - Less suitable because the resolution criterion is *all Mediterranean routes*.

**Most suitable reference class:** #1 (IOM Mediterranean Jan–Feb totals, 2014–2025).

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Resolution window:** through **end of February 2026**; resolves **March 1, 2026**. From today (Feb 22) there are ~**7 days** left, but the metric itself is **Jan 1–Feb 28/29** cumulative.
- **Seasonality:** Jan–Feb is winter; crossings can be fewer but risk per crossing can be high. Still, historically (per the limited comparators provided), Jan–Feb totals have not approached 800.
- **Implied rate:** 800 deaths in ~59 days (Jan+Feb) ≈ **13.6/day** on average. Historical comparator years cited (e.g., ~427 over Jan–mid-Feb) imply substantially lower averages even in very bad years.

### (d) Justification for an outside-view baseline

Using the historical comparators provided as a proxy for the 2014–2025 distribution:

- The **highest early-year comparator mentioned** is roughly **~427 (2015)**, with **~416 (2016)** also cited—both are around **half** the 800 threshold.  
- No evidence in the provided historical context suggests **any** pre-2026 year reached **≥800 by end-Feb**; in fact, the reporting frames 2026 as unprecedented specifically because it already exceeds prior early-year records.
- Therefore, as an *unconditional base rate* (“in a typical year from this era, would Jan–Feb reach 800?”), the answer should be **very low**, reflecting an event that appears outside the historical range.

However, base rates should not be set to literal 0%: migration mortality has fat-tailed risk (rare mass-casualty events; delayed discovery/backfill). So we leave a small probability mass for an extreme outlier year.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether to observed base-rate evidence:** prior early-year peaks around **~400–430** vs threshold **800** (nearly **2×**). That is a very large gap in a domain where year-to-year variation is meaningful but not usually doubling the historical maximum over the same window.
- **Upset rate / tail risk:** maritime disasters are lumpy and reporting can be revised, so “extreme outlier” probability shouldn’t be zero. Still, hitting ≥800 by end-Feb would likely require either (i) multiple very large disasters plus sustained high incident rate, or (ii) unusually large retrospective additions—both historically uncommon.
- **Outside-view probability range:** low single digits seems appropriate; I’ll place it around ~3%, acknowledging fat-tail risk without letting the baseline be dominated by what is (historically) an unprecedented outcome.

Outside View Prediction:
**3.2%**
