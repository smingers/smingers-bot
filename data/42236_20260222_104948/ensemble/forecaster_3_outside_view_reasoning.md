**Analyzing prediction methods**

I need to focus on making an outside view prediction rather than using an inside view. But I might consider current data from 2026. Typically, an outside view relies on historical patterns, so I should use data until February 22, 2026, as a baseline. 

I can pull historical data: for example, figures from previous years show values ranging from 200 to 400, but an 800 threshold seems highly unusual, likely around 0-2% probability based on past events. However, I must remember that the window starts from February 22.**Clarifying event criteria**

I need to clarify what counts for the YTD sum; it seems only deaths from February 22 to February 28, 2026, will be included. The note indicates that events prior to the opening date don’t count towards the resolution. This could mean I should use the IOM dataset specifically for that timeframe. However, there’s a contradiction regarding the YTD criteria, as it mentions counting through the end of February. If 533 deaths were already accounted for, it appears they're focused on whether those subsequent deaths push the total to 800. That seems a bit odd to me.**Interpreting the resolution criteria**

It seems they mean if the threshold of 800 deaths was already met before the opening, the question would resolve with that date as the starting point. Since the threshold isn't met as of February 22, it feels tricky. Even if there were 533 deaths, they’d be treated as zero because only events after February 22 count. This fine print feels typical for Metaculus-style resolutions, but I have to remember that earlier deaths are still part of the YTD dataset through February 28.**Assessing death counts for resolution**

I’m trying to interpret the criteria here. It seems that deaths before February 22 don’t count, but the resolution must consider deaths between February 22 and February 28. However, they haven't adjusted the criteria to match that idea. The title suggests that data from 2026 starts from January 1, meaning earlier deaths should count towards the YTD total. Based on historical data, it's likely that totals in the Mediterranean haven't reached 800—with previous highs being around 416 or 427. So, the probability of reaching 800 by the end of February seems very close to zero.**Evaluating outside view predictions**

To reach 800 deaths by February's end would require an extreme surge, suggesting a very low base rate of 0%. I should consider future conditions, but the outside view likely remains around 1-3%. Given the early 2026 context, it's tough to separate that from the inside view. Still, focusing on historical data from 2014-2025 shows that reaching 800 seems improbable since past highs were around 427. I conclude with an outside view probability of about 3.2%. I'll summarize sources like Le Monde and Al Jazeera for quality evaluation, ensuring they align with historical figures.
