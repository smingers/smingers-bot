Analysis:
1. Paraphrase of question  
“IOM will have logged ≥800 dead + missing on all Mediterranean routes for 1 Jan-29 Feb 2026; cut-off is the version of the public dataset online 1 Mar 2026.”

(a) Source analysis  
• Le Monde, 12 Feb 2026 – cites IOM: 524 deaths/missing 1 Jan-10 Feb.  High-quality, directly attributed figures → good factual weight.  
• UN News & AFP wires, 9–10 Feb – describe 53-fatality Zuwara wreck and quote IOM running totals (≈375 Jan, ≈484 YTD central route).  Reliable institutional sourcing.  
• AFP/Al Jazeera, 20–22 Feb – report new Libya & Crete incidents (≈8 confirmed dead, 20-plus missing) and quote IOM that “at least 567 lives have been lost on the central route so far in 2026.”  Same data channel, recent.  
• Multiple 21–22 Feb Greek-press items – duplicate the Crete wreck numbers; credible but only add single-digit deaths so far.  
• NGO/AFP pieces, 20 Feb – claim ≈380 people missing in “Cyclone Harry” ghost shipwrecks mid-Jan; IOM “still awaiting official confirmation.”  Factual core (boats left, never arrived) is plausible but not yet in the dataset.  
Overall: we have one convergent, high-quality stream of IOM figures (strong evidence) and a second, weaker NGO stream about hundreds still uncounted (moderate evidence).

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
• IOM dataset on 12 Feb already at 524 – an unprecedented start and only 276 short of 800.  
Moderate:  
• IOM central-route figure 567 on 20 Feb implies all-Med total probably around 600.  
• IOM is actively investigating ~380 Cyclone Harry disappearances; if validated they would be back-entered for January.  
Weak:  
• Seven-day weather forecasts show some storms but no concrete prediction of mass departures or sinkings.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Seven (7) days remain until data-freeze.  If the window were halved (3-4 days), probability would drop roughly one-third because less time for new additions or a data backfill.  If doubled (~14 days) I would raise the probability by ~40 %, mostly because of extra time for IOM confirmation work and the chance of another large wreck.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (2014-2025): 3.2 % (no previous year has hit 800 by end-Feb; prior record ≈430).  
Current year is already at roughly 600 (factor 1.4 over previous record) with a week left.  Two distinct ways to gain ≥200 more:

1. Dataset backfill of Cyclone Harry losses.  IOM has publicly acknowledged the events and tends to publish large “invisible” shipwrecks once corroborated.  Typical lag is a few weeks; we are five weeks past the storm. I assign ≈25 % that ≥200 of those missing are validated and uploaded by 1 Mar.  
2. Fresh large incident(s).  Catastrophes of ≥150 deaths occur a few times per decade; one occurring in the next week I rate ≈8 %.  Coupled with normal trickle of smaller fatalities (~25), this yields ≈9 % chance of pushing the tally over 800 without the backfill.  

Combining (allowing overlap) gives ≈30 % chance of meeting the threshold.  I trim to 27 % after noting:  
• IOM confirmation can drag into March/April;  
• some of the 567 central-route deaths may already include a portion of the Cyclone Harry missing, leaving fewer than 200 still uncounted.  

Probability calibration
“Roughly 27 out of 100 times, IOM’s public dataset would show ≥800 Mediterranean deaths by 1 Mar 2026 under today’s conditions.”

Checklist:
• Title/criteria aligned ✔  
• Base rate used (3.2 %) ✔  
• Consistency line above ✔  
• Key evidence (4):  
  1. IOM 524 deaths by 10 Feb (strong).  
  2. IOM 567 central-route by 20 Feb (moderate).  
  3. NGO/IOM investigation of ~380 Cyclone Harry missing (moderate).  
  4. Only 7 days remain (strong negative).  
• Blind-spot: IOM approves a large back-entry the evening of 29 Feb, taking total well over 1,000.  Would raise probability to >70 %.  
• Status-quo outcome (“no backfill, no mega-wreck”) → tally ≈630–670 → “No” remains more likely; leaned slightly toward status-quo.

Probability: 27%
