**Examining dataset updates**

It's possible that the IOM releases dataset updates weekly. If they confirm around 380 missing persons in the central Mediterranean from the January 14-21 timeframe, that could raise the total count close to 1,000. IOM mentioned that "hundreds may have died" and are awaiting official confirmation. Historically, these big missing events can take weeks or months to verify, but if credible, they might be recorded sooner. The dataset is continuous, and I need to anticipate its value around March 1.**Analyzing missing persons data**

The recorded number may include events from Cyclone Harry, as they've reported "at least 375" already documented, with "hundreds more deaths believed unrecorded" due to invisible shipwrecks. This might bring the total to around 450. However, by February 10, there were 524 reported across the Mediterranean, which is larger than my earlier calculation of 428. I think it’s best to treat the 524 figure as a reliable baseline. 

Estimating new recorded deaths means I need around 220 in the next week. The probability of that happening seems low, as large shipwrecks with more than 200 casualties occur rarely. The chances of the IOM retroactively adding over 220 earlier deaths from Cyclone Harry are moderate, but this typically takes time. Still, there's pressure to confirm missing persons counts due to the situation.**Assessing dataset probabilities**

I’m analyzing the likelihood of the dataset surpassing 800 records by March 1. Historical data shows that invisible shipwrecks are recorded days or weeks after mass recoveries, and with Cyclone Harry still not included weeks later, the chance seems low. I estimate a 15-20% probability of exceeding 800. 

I see three main scenarios: 

- A significant backfill from Cyclone Harry (20% probability).
- A new deadly incident before February 28 (2% probability).
- A mix of new incidents and backfill (10% probability).

In total, I think there's a 23% chance of reaching that threshold by the deadline.
