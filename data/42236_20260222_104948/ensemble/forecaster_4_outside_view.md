Analysis: 
a) Source analysis  
1. Le Monde, 12 Feb 2026 – French newspaper of record, pay-walled but partially quoted by wire services. Factual content: IOM‐confirmed 524 Mediterranean dead/missing Jan 1-Feb 10 2026; comparisons with 2015-16. Opinion: IOM spokesperson calling 2026 “worst start … in over a decade.” High reliability, dated within the last 2 weeks.  
2. Al Jazeera, 22 Feb 2026 – Reputable international news outlet. Gives several concrete incident counts (five bodies Libya, three Greece) and repeats IOM figure of ≥375 deaths in January. Minimal opinion. High reliability, date = today.  
3. The Guardian, 9 Feb 2026 – UK newspaper, centre-left. Reports 53 deaths in 5 Feb Zuwara wreck; quotes IOM warnings. High factual reliability, slightly older (13 days).  
4. UN News, 9 Feb 2026 – Official UN site. Same 53-death incident; cites ≥375 January deaths. Very high reliability; slightly older.  
5. BBC, 9 Feb 2026 – UK public broadcaster. Same Zuwara incident; says “nearly 500” deaths so far. High reliability, same vintage.  
6. Agent report (22 Feb 2026) – Collates MMP dataset & media. Gives table of Jan–Feb totals back to 2015, quotes Independent (16 Feb 2026) figure of ≥533. Although second-hand, numbers are traceable to IOM; quality moderate-to-high.

All hard numbers are ultimately sourced to IOM Missing Migrants Project (primary data for resolution). Opinion statements are limited to IOM officials and therefore pertinent.

b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i) Mediterranean Jan 1–Feb 28 death totals 2014-2025 (11 observations).  
ii) All-routes migrant death spikes following exceptional January storms (2016, 2024).  
iii) Any year in which final annual Mediterranean toll exceeded 3 000 (2015-17).  

Class (i) is the closest match: same region, same two-month window, uniform data collection method. In this class, the Jan-Feb toll ranged 150–~500; in 0/11 years did it reach 800. Therefore base-rate probability for “≥800 by end-Feb” ≈ 0 % (Laplace-smoothed 1/13 → 7 %). I adopt class (i).

c) Time-frame analysis  
Today is 22 Feb 2026. Resolution looks at deaths recorded 1 Jan–29 Feb 2026 (7 days left, because 2026 is not a leap year). Historically the bulk of winter Mediterranean deaths occur in Jan-Mar, but February is usually quieter than January (mean share ≈35 % of Jan-Feb total). Average historical daily pace Jan-Feb ≈ 6–8 deaths; peak year 2016 ≈ 9/day. To bridge the current gap of roughly 267, the pace would need to average ≈ 38/day during the remaining week or the database must incorporate large earlier “invisible shipwreck” revisions before 1 Mar.

d) Justification  
Outside view deliberately brackets out case-specific narratives and focuses on the reference-class experience. In eleven prior seasons the MMP database never crossed 800 deaths by February’s end. Even 2016, the deadliest full year on record (5 136), stood near 450 at this point. The statistical base rate after Laplace smoothing is about 7 %.  

Upsets do happen: in humanitarian‐disaster data, previously unseen extremes appear perhaps once per decade (≈10 % frequency). This argues for nudging the 7 % base rate slightly upward. Conversely, the very short remaining window (7 days) limits how far reality can diverge from the present tally; late data back-filling can raise the total, but historically back-fills between mid-February and 1 March have seldom exceeded 100 persons. I therefore weight:  

• Pure base rate (7 %) – weight 70 %  
• Low-probability tail for an unprecedented data infusion or major wreck (20 %) – weight 30 %  
Weighted probability = 7 % × 0.7 + 20 % × 0.3 = 10.9 %

Outside view calibration:  
Anchor on Laplace-smoothed 7 % (1/13). Consider historical surprise frequency (~10 %) and near-term practical limits on data revision. Adjust modestly upward but stay below 15 % to respect reference-class rarity. My calibrated outside-view estimate is 11 %.

Outside View Prediction:  
11.0 %
