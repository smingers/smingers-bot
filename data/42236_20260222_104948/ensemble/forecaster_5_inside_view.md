Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological key points)
• Le Monde, 12 Feb 2026 – Pay-walled but quotes IOM: 524 Mediterranean dead/missing 1 Jan-10 Feb. Mainstream French daily; statistics attributed to IOM → high quality, factual.  
• UN News, 9 Feb – 53-death Libya wreck, confirms 375 deaths in January; UN press service → high quality.  
• AFP/Al-Jazeera, 22 Feb – Reports five bodies Libya, capsizing Crete; repeats IOM January figure. Reliable wire services, factual for new incidents.  
• AFP wire, 20 Feb – IOM figure “at least 567 deaths in the central Mediterranean so far in 2026”. Central route only, implies Mediterranean total ≥ 590. Reliable.  
• Multiple 21-22 Feb local press (Crete capsizing) – 3-5 confirmed dead, c.20 missing. Local outlets quoting Hellenic Coast Guard; moderately reliable.  
• January 26 cluster (UN/AFP/Euronews) – IOM spokesman: nine missing boats mid-Jan with c.380 people. Investigation ongoing; high quality but status still “unconfirmed”.

Factual numbers are clearly separated from activist commentary (e.g., NGO claims of 1 000 dead in Cyclone Harry, treated as unconfirmed opinion).

2. Evidence analysis (strength rated per bullet)
Strong evidence  
• 375 officially recorded deaths in January 2026 (IOM) – establishes unprecedented baseline.  
• 524 officially recorded by 10 Feb (IOM, Le Monde) – shows rapid growth.  
• 567 central-route deaths by 20 Feb (AFP quoting IOM) – pushes confirmed total to ≈ 590 Mediterranean-wide.  
Moderate evidence  
• Nine missing boats mid-Jan (≈ 380 people) under active IOM investigation – could be entered in database in coming days.  
• Pattern: winter storms (“Cyclone Harry”) caused multiple “ghost” shipwrecks → historically such cases sometimes logged weeks later.  
Weak evidence  
• NGO estimates of “~1 000 dead” – anecdotal until validated.  
• Possibility of a single mega-wreck (>200) in last week of February – conceivable but infrequent.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Seven days remain until 29 Feb. 210 deaths (≈590→800) must be added to the IOM database inside that week.  If the horizon were halved to 3-4 days my probability would drop about one-third (to ~20 %).  If doubled to four weeks, I would raise it to ~45 %, because data-entry lags would almost certainly capture the missing-boat cases.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (Jan-Feb 2014-2025) of reaching 800 deaths = 0/12 → 10 % after Laplace correction.  
Inside-view upward pressures:  
• Confirmed count already a record-high ≈ 590 (strong).  
• 380 people from known missing boats likely to be coded as “dead/missing”; even partial confirmation (>55 %) suffices (moderate–strong).  
• IOM often finalises outstanding January events in late February updates (moderate).  
• Only one large incident (>200) would also clear the bar, but odds of that within a week are low (weak).  
Downward pressures:  
• IOM verification can be slow; some missing-boat cases may slip to March or later (moderate).  
• Search-and-rescue weather improves after current storm front, reducing likelihood of new large wrecks this week (moderate).

Net effect: multiply the 10 % base by roughly ×3 owing to the already-observed surge and pending investigations → 30 % rounded.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 30 times in 100, the IOM Mediterranean tally will reach 800 dead/missing by 29 Feb 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Restatement – “At least 800 Mediterranean migrant dead + missing recorded by IOM between 1 Jan and 29 Feb 2026.”  
2. Outside-view base = 10 %.  
3. Consistency line completed above.  
4. Key evidence (20 words each):  
   a) 590 confirmed deaths by 20 Feb – unprecedented.  
   b) 380-person missing-boat cluster under IOM review.  
   c) IOM often logs back-dated deaths in late-Feb update.  
   d) Only 210 additional needed to cross threshold.  
5. Blind spot – IOM postpones coding missing-boat cases until March; threshold then missed despite true toll >800.  
6. Status-quo (no further data added) produces a No outcome; inertia favours No but current momentum is unusual → slight downward nudge already applied.

Probability: 30%
