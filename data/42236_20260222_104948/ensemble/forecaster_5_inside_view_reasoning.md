**Evaluating probabilities for Cyclone Harry**

I’m approximating numbers: starting with 567, adding 20 for the Mediterranean, and maybe 10 for Eastern cases, which brings me to 600. I need to examine the chance that the organization will record 'Cyclone Harry' missing 300 people as dead or missing by February 29. They tend to update their records gradually, so I estimate a 25% probability for this update. Given the potential for large incidents, I think the combined probability might reach around 35%, but I need to double-check for overlap in counting.**Calculating final probabilities**

I’m diving into my calculations. First, if ghost boats are recorded by February 29, there's a 25% chance that the threshold of 1000+ will be passed, which I’ll consider as a yes. If they aren't recorded, I'm at 600, then factoring in moderate tragedies with a 20% chance of adding 50-100, I still won't reach 800. Now, for a large incident over 200, that’s a 5% chance. The overall probability of meeting the threshold then appears to be around 30%. I’ll just double-check it before finalizing my analysis.
