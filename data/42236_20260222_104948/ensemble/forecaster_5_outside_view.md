Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
1. Le Monde, 12 Feb 2026 – Factual: gives IOM-confirmed figures for 2016 (416), 2025 (219) and 2026 to date (524).  High-quality mainstream paper, figures attributed to IOM.  
2. Al-Jazeera, 22 Feb 2026 – Factual: repeats IOM numbers for January 2026 (375) and several recent incidents.  Major international outlet; data likewise sourced to IOM.  
3. The Guardian, 9 Feb 2026 – Describes one 53-death incident; reliable paper, but only event-specific.  
4. UN News, 9 Feb 2026 – UN press service; reproduces IOM statistics (375 Jan deaths).  Highly reliable for numeric data.  
5. BBC, 9 Feb 2026 – Similar to Guardian; reliable but single incident.  
6. Agent report (compiled 22 Feb 2026) – Collates IOM and press data for Jan–Feb totals back to 2015.  Useful synthesis; still secondary, but figures match the primary Le Monde and UN numbers for past years.

The only opinions are warnings by IOM spokespeople that numbers are under-counted; these come from the data-collecting body itself and are therefore kept.

(b)  Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• All Mediterranean Jan–Feb death totals 2014-2025 (12 yearly observations).  
• All years world-wide where the IOM eventually recorded ≥4 000 deaths for the full year (2014, 2015, 2016).  
The first class is directly matched to the question (same region, same two-month window) and has a reasonable number of observations; the second is too small (n=3).  I use the first class.

Observed distribution Jan 1–Feb 29 deaths, 2014-2025 (rounded):  
2014 ≈ 260; 2015 427; 2016 416; 2017 252; 2018 238; 2019 175; 2020 100; 2021 130; 2022  65; 2023  97; 2024 ≈ 350; 2025 219.  
Maximum = 427, median ≈ 200.  Zero of twelve years reached 800.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
The event window is fixed: 1 Jan – 29 Feb (60 days).  We stand on 22 Feb; only seven calendar days remain.  Historically, the final week of February seldom adds more than 50 deaths (typical daily rate 2–10).  Thus most of the variance comes from what happened earlier, not what will happen in the last week.

(d)  Justification for outside-view probability  
Base-rate frequency: 0/12 = 0 %.  Because the sample is small and the future could differ, apply a Laplace (add-one) correction → 1/14 ≈ 7 %.  
Upset rate: even long-shot humanitarian events occasionally occur; 2015’s 427 vs 2014’s 260 already showed a big jump, so tail events are plausible.  To reflect this, widen from 7 % to 10 %.  
Expert/market priors are unavailable for this exact threshold; humanitarian NGOs typically warn of under-counting but have not predicted a doubling of the previous record in the first two months.  That keeps the outside view in the low-teens.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: Laplace-corrected 7 %.  
Adjust +3 % for fat-tailed casualty distributions and acknowledged under-counting in IOM data.  
No further adjustment for the remaining week, because the outside view deliberately ignores this year’s partial data.  
Final outside-view probability = 10 %.
