**Evaluating migrant death predictions**

I'm focusing on analyzing whether the IOM Missing Migrants Project will record at least 800 Mediterranean migrant deaths before March 2026. I’ll look at outside views based on historical data, steering clear of current year specifics. 

First, I need to analyze sources and evaluate reports. I want to consider data from 2014 to 2025, focusing on January and February numbers. Historically, only 2016 reached 5136 total deaths, with minimal early counts in other years, leading me to calculate a base rate of 0% for reaching 800 deaths by the end of February.**Refining outside view predictions**

I'm considering how to adjust my predictions for whether the IOM Missing Migrants Project will record at least 800 deaths before March 2026. While the small sample makes it tricky, I can look at full-year totals and the typical January-February share, which is usually around 10-15%. 

Using 2016’s full year total of 5,136, a 15% share would suggest about 770 deaths, but the actual count was only 416, making 800 seem high. Historically, the chance of reaching that threshold is extremely low, under 1%. My baseline prediction should rely solely on historical data, without adjusting for early counts from 2026 to stay true to the outside view approach.**Crafting the analysis**

I’m thinking about how to generate an outside view prediction, incorporating some generic details. First, I’ll summarize source analyses from outlets like Le Monde and Al Jazeera, treating their early-year counts as historical data from previous years.

Next, for the reference class, I’ll evaluate Mediterranean counts from 2014 to 2025. I’ve noted that the likelihood of exceeding 800 deaths is extremely low, possibly around 0% historically, but to account for uncertainty, I might suggest a 2% probability.

Lastly, with only seven days left in February, I’ll provide a final probability estimate of around 5-8%, emphasizing historical patterns that show little increase near the month's end.
