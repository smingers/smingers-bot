Analysis:
The key to forecasting is knowing the present year-to-date (YTD) death-and-missing count that the IOM Missing Migrants Project attributes to the Mediterranean, plus awareness of any large, very recent shipwrecks that might not yet be in the database but could be added before 1 March. Therefore, I need:  
1) The latest IOM Missing Migrants Mediterranean 2026 YTD figure (through mid/late February).  
2) News of any major Mediterranean migrant disasters in February 2026 whose casualties may soon be logged.  
3) Context on reporting lags or IOM commentary about forthcoming data updates.  
The Google query targets the IOM dataset or dashboard itself; the Google News query targets press coverage of new shipwrecks; the AskNews query seeks an up-to-date synthesized figure plus incident details.
