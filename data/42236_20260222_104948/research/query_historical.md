Analysis:
To estimate the likelihood that the 800-death threshold will be reached by the end of February 2026, the key historical context is: (a) how many deaths the Missing Migrants Project has usually recorded in the Mediterranean by late February in previous years, and (b) the current, year-to-date 2026 total. Therefore I want (1) the raw IOM dataset or its Mediterranean subset for past years, (2) any official IOM or NGO press releases giving the running total for 2026, and (3) recent news articles quoting that number.
