Around 50 migrants were on board, primarily from Egypt and Sudan, including four minors, as reported by the Greek news agency ANA. Twenty survivors were rescued by a merchant ship in the waters near Kaloi Limenes, just as the vessel\u2014sent by the Greek Maritime Rescue Coordination Center\u2014approached the overcrowded wooden boat. The capsizing occurred when passengers attempted to climb the ship\u2019s ladders, and a sudden movement on one side caused the boat to overturn. Search operations continued on Saturday, February 22, 2026, with four patrol boats, one aircraft, and two vessels from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex). A second boat carrying approximately 40 migrants was also discovered in the area, prompting an additional rescue mission. Since over a year ago, increasing numbers of migrants have attempted to reach Crete from Libya, which serves as a gateway into the European Union. However, the journey remains perilous: according to the UNHCR, over 16,770 asylum seekers arrived in Crete in 2025\u2014more than on any other Aegean island. The UNHCR recorded 107 deaths or missing persons in Greek waters during 2025.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 22, 2026 09:36 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/98FU6NT)\n\n**Tragedy in the Mediterranean: Bodies Recovered in Libya and Capsizing Near Crete with Dozens Missing**\nTwo separate maritime tragedies occurred in the Mediterranean: five bodies were recovered on the Libyan coast near Qasr al-Akhyar, close to Tripoli, with additional victims possibly still being washed ashore; and a wooden boat capsized during a rescue operation south of Crete, resulting in confirmed deaths, dozens of missing persons, and several survivors rescued. The victims in Libya included two women and possibly a child, with preliminary medical-legal assessments indicating features consistent with dark-skinned migrants. The incident near Crete involved approximately 50 people on board, mostly Egyptian and Sudanese nationals, including minors, and occurred during a rescue operation involving commercial vessels and the Greek coast guard, which led to instability due to overcrowding on one side of the boat. Authorities reported conflicting numbers\u2014some citing three recovered bodies, others up to five and about twenty missing\u2014without official passenger lists. Search and rescue operations, coordinated by Greek maritime authorities and Frontex, continue with naval, aerial, and commercial vessel involvement. The situation underscores the extreme dangers of the central Mediterranean route, marked by overcrowded, unsafe vessels, human trafficking networks, and systemic abuse of migrants in Libya, as documented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The UNHCR reports over 16,770 asylum seekers landed in Crete by 2026, prompting temporary suspension of asylum processing and capacity expansion in Greek hotspots. International organizations and NGOs are urging stronger search-and-rescue mechanisms, political coordination, and structural solutions addressing root causes of migration, including local stabilization and legal pathways, amid ongoing calls for a halt to returns to Libya until safety conditions are restored. The events highlight persistent failures in humanitarian and political responses to migration crises.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 22, 2026 06:03 AM\nSource:[Notizie.it](https://www.notizie.it/tragedia-nel-mediterraneo-corpi-in-libia-e-naufragio-vicino-a-creta-con-dispersi/)\n\n**Boat capsizes off Crete, five dead and dozens feared missing**\nA wooden boat carrying approximately 50 migrants capsized 15 nautical miles off Kala Limena on Crete's southern coast on February 21, 2026, resulting in at least five confirmed deaths and around 20 others missing, according to the Hellenic Coast Guard. The incident occurred when passengers shifted to one side while attempting to climb a ladder lowered from a rescue vessel, causing the overcrowded boat to lose balance. A Panamanian-flagged cargo ship rescued 20 survivors. Search and rescue operations, involving the Hellenic Coast Guard, Frontex, a helicopter, a military aircraft, and nearby commercial vessels, are ongoing. Three bodies were recovered initially, with two additional bodies found later. The event follows the earlier discovery of two men near the Evros River, believed to have died from hypothermia after crossing in freezing conditions. Greece has remained a major entry point for irregular migrants and refugees since 2015, with over one million arrivals recorded in the past decade. Frontex data indicates a 27% decline in irregular migration along the Eastern Mediterranean route in 2025, with approximately 51,400 arrivals in Greece last year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2026 03:57 PM\nSource:[D A I J I W O R L D](https://daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay)\n\n**At Least 3 Dead in Migrant Boat Capsizing Off the Coast of Crete**\nAt least three people died when a migrant boat capsized off the coast of Crete, Greece, on February 21, 2026, according to local media citing the Greek coast guard. The incident occurred approximately 15 nautical miles (nearly 28 kilometers) south of Kaloi Limenes in southern Crete. The victims are believed to be migrants attempting to reach the European Union from Libya. At least 20 people were rescued and brought safely to shore by a Greek rescue vessel. A search operation for possible missing persons is ongoing. Around the same time, another migrant boat carrying approximately 40 people was also detected nearby and its passengers were brought ashore together with the survivors. Human smugglers regularly transport migrants from Libya and Turkey to Crete and the Aegean islands. According to the UNHCR, about 42,000 migrants reached Greek islands by sea in 2025. In the eastern Mediterranean, 107 migrant deaths were recorded in 2025, though the Greek coast guard believes the actual number is higher due to unreported cases.

According to the Greek coast guard, the incident occurred when one of two commercial vessels dispatched by the national search and rescue center approached the overcrowded boat; as migrants scrambled to climb a ladder, the vessel tipped and capsized. A Panamanian-flagged cargo ship rescued 20 individuals, while Hellenic Coast Guard and Frontex vessels recovered three bodies, with two additional bodies found later at sea. Survivors reported around 50 people were on board, raising concerns that the death toll may rise. Search and rescue operations continue involving coast guard ships, commercial vessels, a helicopter, and a military aircraft. This incident follows the recovery of two migrant men near the Evros River border between Greece and Turkey earlier in February, believed to have died from hypothermia. Since 2015, Greece has served as a major EU entry point for irregular migrants and refugees, with over one million arrivals in the past decade; hundreds have died at sea and dozens in the Evros region.

The groups emphasized the urgent need to provide answers to families searching for loved ones, noting that approximately a dozen decomposed migrant bodies had been found on southern Italian beaches. According to reports from Mediterranea, Refugees in Libya, and Alarm Phone, over ten boats departed from Sfax, Tunisia, between January 14 and 21, 2026, carrying an estimated 1,000 people. Only one boat is known to have reached Lampedusa; the fate of the others remains unknown. Alarm Phone and Memoria Mediterranea have received numerous distress calls from families of missing migrants.

During the storm 'Harry' between January 18 and 20, hundreds of migrants attempted to cross the Mediterranean from Tunisia under severe weather conditions. Initial estimates by the organization suggested around 380 people were missing, but this number may not reflect the full scale of the tragedy, as bodies continue to be found at sea or remain unaccounted for, particularly near Pantelleria (Sicily) and other southern Italian locations. The ONG called for effective identification procedures, timely information sharing with affected families, strengthened international cooperation, and the publication of updated statistics on victims. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) had previously warned at the end of January that hundreds of people may have died or gone missing due to shipwrecks caused by the storms. The IOM stated, 'Although the IOM is still awaiting official confirmation, the scale of reported fatalities points to another major tragedy in the central Mediterranean.' The central Mediterranean route, which connects North Africa\u2014particularly Libya and Tunisia\u2014to Europe, notably Italy and Malta, remains the world\u2019s deadliest migration corridor.

They demand full compliance with DNA collection protocols and guaranteed traceability of burials to provide answers to numerous families searching for their missing relatives. The exodus was triggered by escalating violence in Tunisia, prompting hundreds to depart from Sfax. Over ten boats reportedly left between January 14 and 21, carrying an estimated 1,000 people, during the two-week duration of Cyclone Harry, which severely disrupted weather conditions in the central Mediterranean, making navigation extremely hazardous and routes uncertain.

The report documents 303 migrant tragedies by mid-December and attributes the high death toll to the hardening of European migration policies that prioritize surveillance and deterrence over rescue operations. The Atlantic route from Mauritania to the Canary Islands was the deadliest, accounting for over 1,300 deaths, with numerous vessels disappearing under extreme weather conditions. The Western Mediterranean route, particularly from Algeria to Spain and toward the Balearic Islands, also remained highly dangerous, responsible for over 1,000 deaths. New migration routes have emerged from Guinea, with long and perilous crossings involving women and children, while the Gambia has seen a rise in maritime fatalities. The Strait of Gibraltar remains a deadly crossing point, with many young migrants attempting to swim across in hazardous conditions. The NGO criticizes European border externalization policies, accusing them of turning African countries into buffer zones through security and financial agreements with nations like Mauritania.

Preliminary reports indicate at least three shipwrecks occurred on January 23 and 25, with potentially 104 deaths confirmed or feared. Boats believed to have departed from Tunisia and Libya were involved, including one that left Sfax, Tunisia, carrying around 380 people between January 14 and 21.

In a confirmed search and rescue operation, three deaths were confirmed in Lampedusa, Italy, including twin girls aged approximately one year who died of hypothermia, along with one adult male who also died of hypothermia. The IOM stressed that smuggling migrants on unseaworthy and overcrowded vessels is a criminal act, particularly egregious given that severe weather, including Cyclone Harry, hampered rescue efforts. The agency described the situation as 'yet another major tragedy' and emphasized that the Central Mediterranean remains the deadliest migration route, with 1,340 fatalities recorded in 2025 alone and over 33,000 deaths or disappearances since 2014, according to the Missing Migrants Project. The IOM called for intensified international action to dismantle smuggling networks and prevent further loss of life.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 09:11 PM\nSource:[Free Malaysia Today](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2026/01/27/un-fears-hundreds-missing-or-dead-in-mediterranean-shipwrecks-since-start-of-2026)\n\n**UN Agency: Mediterranean Sea Claims Hundreds of Migrants in Weeks**\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency, reported on January 26, 2026, that hundreds of migrants are believed to have gone missing or died in the central Mediterranean Sea during January 2026, due to multiple boat sinkings. The organization expressed 'grave concern' over reports of several boat accidents, citing severe weather conditions that severely hampered search and rescue operations. According to IOM spokesperson Jorge Galindo, three boat incidents were reported in the past ten days\u2014two on January 23 and one on January 25\u2014resulting in the presumed deaths of 104 people. The IOM estimates that nine boats, primarily departing from Tunisia and Libya, sank between January 14 and 21, with approximately 380 people missing. Merna Abdel Azim, a data analyst with the IOM\u2019s 'Missing Migrants Project,' confirmed that only three fatalities from the January 23 incident have been verified. Among the victims were twin infants, aged one, who died of hypothermia before reaching Lampedusa, Italy, and a man who died upon arrival under the same cause. The mother, a woman from Guinea, had boarded the boat in Sfax, Tunisia. The IOM warned that the final death toll could be significantly higher, underscoring that the central Mediterranean remains the world\u2019s deadliest migration route. One additional boat, carrying at least 51 people, departed from the same location but never reached its destination and is believed to have sunk near Tobruk, Libya. Another boat with at least 51 people sank, with only one survivor. The IOM condemned the smuggling of migrants on unsafe, overcrowded vessels as criminal, emphasizing that organizing departures during severe storms constitutes a particularly heinous act, deliberately placing lives at near-certain risk. The organization reiterated that the central Mediterranean is the world\u2019s most dangerous migration route, with 1,340 deaths recorded in 2025. Since 2014, over 33,000 migrants have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean, according to the Missing Migrants Project.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 08:51 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2026/1/26/%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B8%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%B9-%D9%85%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%AA)\n\n**Hundreds of Migrants Missing in Central Mediterranean in January 2026 (UN)**\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM), a United Nations agency, reported on January 26, 2026, that hundreds of migrants likely went missing or died in the central Mediterranean Sea during January 2026 due to multiple boat sinkings. The IOM expressed 'grave concern' over reports of several boat accidents, citing severe weather conditions that severely hampered search and rescue operations. The organization is investigating these incidents and estimates that around 380 people may have gone missing in the first weeks of 2026 alone. According to IOM data, nine boats\u2014originating from Tunisia\u2014sank between January 14 and 21, 2026, carrying an estimated 380 migrants. Of these, only three deaths were confirmed, including twin infants who died from hypothermia before reaching land, and a man who died upon arrival. Survivors reported another boat with at least 51 people that vanished near Tobruk, Libya, and a separate boat with at least 51 people that sank, leaving only one survivor. The IOM reiterated that the central Mediterranean route remains the deadliest in the world, with 1,340 deaths recorded in 2025. Since 2014, over 33,000 migrants have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean, according to the 'Missing Migrants Project'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 06:04 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/942J29F)\n\n**UN: Hundreds of migrants feared dead in shipwrecks since start of 2026**\nThe International Organisation for Migration (IOM) reported that hundreds of migrants may be missing or feared dead following multiple shipwrecks in the Central Mediterranean between January 14 and 25, 2026. The agency confirmed three deaths in Lampedusa, Italy, including twin girls aged about one year who died of hypothermia, and a man who also succumbed to cold. Preliminary reports indicate at least 104 deaths from three shipwrecks on January 23 and 25, involving boats believed to have departed from Tunisia and Libya. IOM is investigating nine additional missing boats that left Tunisia between January 14 and 21, carrying approximately 380 people. Severe weather from Cyclone Harry hampered search and rescue operations. The IOM warned that these incidents, occurring amid a major storm, point to a 'major tragedy' and underscore the lethal risks posed by smuggling networks that deploy unseaworthy, overcrowded vessels. The agency emphasized that sending migrants to sea under such conditions constitutes a criminal act, especially when weather warnings were known. The Central Mediterranean remains the deadliest migration corridor globally, with 1,340 fatalities recorded in 2025 alone. Since 2014, over 33,000 migrants have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean, according to the IOM's Missing Migrants Project.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 05:30 PM\nSource:[Euronews English](http://www.euronews.com/2026/01/26/hundreds-of-migrants-feared-dead-in-mediterranean-shipwrecks-since-start-of-2026-un-says)\n\n**IOM calls for enhanced safety after 40 migrants drown in Tunisia shipwreck**\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) has called for enhanced safety measures following a shipwreck in Tunisia that resulted in the deaths of 40 migrants. According to IOM\u2019s Missing Migrants Project, 1,000 deaths and disappearances have been recorded in the Central Mediterranean so far in 2025. The IOM reiterated its support for protection-sensitive search and rescue operations along key migration routes and urged the expansion of safe and regular migration pathways. The organization expressed 'deepest condolences to the families of the victims.' Migrants often endure extreme dangers during Mediterranean crossings, only to face European border protection measures, including expulsions, and eventual return to countries like Libya and Tunisia\u2014nations that enforce Europe\u2019s migration crackdowns in exchange for continued financial support. This system has drawn previous criticism, with some describing it as condemned due to its humanitarian consequences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/10/iom-calls-for-enhanced-safety-after-40-migrants-drown-in-tunisia-shipwreck/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
