Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **The Independent (Feb 22, 2026)** – High-quality, named IOM spokesperson quoted. Reports 567 Mediterranean deaths across all routes in early 2026, 501 on Central Mediterranean alone. Current and directly relevant. Factual: 567 deaths figure, 501 central Mediterranean. Opinion: policy critiques from Amnesty UK, Metadrasi, UNHCR.

2. **Vatican News (Feb 3, 2026)** – Moderate quality. Reports NGO estimate of ~1,000 feared missing after Cyclone Harry. Named source (Laura Marmorale, Mediterranea Saving Humans) is an advocacy figure. The 380 officially missing figure from Rome's Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre is more reliable than the 1,000 NGO estimate.

3. **Al Jazeera (Feb 22, 2026)** – High quality, current. Reports IOM data: 375 migrants dead/missing in January 2026 alone. Named IOM as institutional source. Factual: 375 January deaths, 53 dead/missing from Feb 5-6 incident.

4. **The New Humanitarian (Oct 2025)** – Historical context only. UNHCR recorded 1,000+ central Mediterranean deaths by late October 2025. Not directly relevant to 2026 Q1 question.

5. **Le Monde (Feb 12, 2026)** – High quality, paywalled but visible portion shows 524 deaths Jan 1–Feb 10, 2026. IOM spokesperson quoted directly: "worst start to a year in over a decade." Strong, named institutional source.

6. **AFP/Middle East Monitor (Feb 9-10, 2026)** – High quality wire service. IOM data: 53 dead/missing Feb 5-6 off Libya, bringing total to at least 484 by Feb 9. Factual, IOM-attributed.

7. **AFP (Feb 20, 2026)** – High quality. IOM reported at least 567 migrant lives lost in central Mediterranean so far in 2026. This is the most recent IOM figure available.

8. **Multiple sources on Crete capsizing (Feb 21-22, 2026)** – Multiple independent sources (AFP, Daijiworld, YesPunjab, VRT) confirm 5 dead, ~20 missing off Crete on Feb 21. Greek coast guard named source. Adds to the running 2026 total.

9. **IOM/Euronews (Jan 26, 2026)** – High quality. IOM warned hundreds feared dead from Cyclone Harry shipwrecks, 104 confirmed from Jan 23-25 incidents alone.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence (large weight):**
- **IOM data as of Feb 20, 2026**: At least 567 deaths in central Mediterranean in 2026 (AFP, Feb 20). This is the official IOM figure, directly from the resolution source.
- **Feb 21 Crete incident**: 5 confirmed dead, ~20 missing — adds to running total, bringing estimated total to ~590+ by Feb 22.
- **Established pace**: ~375 deaths in January alone (12+/day), continued through February. Only 900 - 590 = 310 more deaths needed over ~38 remaining days (Feb 23 – Mar 31), requiring ~8.2/day.
- **IOM characterization**: "Worst start to a year in over a decade" — institutional confirmation of unprecedented pace.
- **Le Monde data**: 524 deaths by Feb 10 (IOM-sourced), consistent with other sources.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Historical pace**: Even in slower years, Mediterranean deaths don't stop in Feb-March. Spring typically sees increased crossings.
- **Structural factors**: No policy changes that would dramatically reduce crossings; smuggling networks active; ongoing conflict/instability in origin countries.

**Weak evidence:**
- **NGO estimate of 1,000 missing from Cyclone Harry**: Advocacy figures, not IOM-confirmed. Cannot be directly applied to resolution criteria.

**Key quantitative anchor:**
- IOM figure as of ~Feb 20: 567 deaths
- Feb 21 Crete: +5 confirmed dead, +~20 missing = ~592 by Feb 22
- Remaining days: 38 (Feb 23 – Mar 31)
- Deaths needed: ~308 more
- Required daily rate: ~8.1/day
- Established daily rate (Jan-Feb): ~12-15/day

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

Resolution: April 1, 2026 — approximately 38 days from today (Feb 22).

**Current status**: ~590+ deaths as of Feb 22, needing ~310 more in 38 days.

**If timeframe halved (19 days)**: Would need 310 deaths in 19 days (~16.3/day) — still plausible but tighter; probability drops to ~80-85%.

**If timeframe doubled (76 days)**: Would need 310 deaths in 76 days (~4.1/day) — virtually certain; probability ~99.5%.

At current timeframe, the math strongly favors resolution. Even at half the established pace (6/day), 38 days × 6 = 228 additional deaths, total ~818 — still below threshold. At 8.2/day (65% of established pace), threshold is reached exactly. This creates a small but non-trivial risk zone.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate was 98.5%, which I maintain with minor adjustment. The key factors:

1. **IOM official data (Feb 20)**: 567 deaths confirmed — this is the resolution source itself showing 63% of the threshold already met with 38 days remaining.

2. **Required pace vs. established pace**: Need 8.1/day for remaining period; established pace is 12-15/day. The pace would need to drop by 40-46% to just barely miss the threshold. A complete halt (unprecedented) would still leave the question at ~590/900.

3. **Ongoing incidents**: Feb 21-22 reports show deaths continuing at pace (Crete capsizing, Libya bodies).

4. **No mechanism for sudden cessation**: No policy, weather, or structural factor would cause Mediterranean crossings to stop for 38 days.

5. **IOM undercounting**: The resolution source (IOM Missing Migrants Project) is known to undercount; the actual pace may be higher than reported figures suggest.

The only realistic NO scenario: If the 567 figure somehow includes deaths outside the "Mediterranean" region as defined by IOM's dataset, or if there's a data revision. However, the AFP article specifically states "central Mediterranean" and the IOM dataset tracks Mediterranean as a region — these should align.

**Probability Calibration**

The math is compelling: 590+ deaths by Feb 22, needing only 310 more in 38 days at 8.1/day vs. established 12-15/day pace. The probability of NO resolution requires either:
- Deaths dropping to near-zero for 38 days (essentially impossible)
- A data/definitional mismatch between news reports and IOM dataset (small but non-zero risk)
- IOM revising figures downward significantly (rare but possible)

I maintain 98% probability. The 2% uncertainty covers definitional/data issues and the small chance that the pace drops dramatically (e.g., severe weather preventing crossings for extended period, though this historically increases deaths when crossings resume).

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria**: IOM Missing Migrants Project shows dead+missing in "Mediterranean" region ≥ 900 by end of March 2026. My analysis tracks IOM-reported Mediterranean deaths — aligned.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 98.5% (historically unprecedented pace in 2026, already 63% of threshold met by Feb 22).

3. **Consistency check**: "98 out of 100 times, IOM records ≥900 Mediterranean deaths by end of March 2026." This makes sense given 590+ already recorded with 38 days remaining at established pace.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - IOM official data: 567 deaths by ~Feb 20 (strong, named institutional source)
   - Feb 21 Crete: 5+ additional deaths (multiple independent sources)
   - Established pace 12-15/day vs. required 8.1/day (mathematical analysis)
   - IOM: "worst start to a year in over a decade" (institutional confirmation)
   - No structural mechanism for cessation of crossings/deaths

5. **Blind spot**: If IOM's "Mediterranean" regional classification in their dataset excludes some incidents reported in news as "Mediterranean" (e.g., Eastern Mediterranean counted separately), the 567 figure might be lower in the actual dataset. This could shift probability down ~3-5%.

6. **Status quo**: The status quo is ongoing Mediterranean crossings and deaths — strongly supports YES resolution.

Probability calibration: The evidence is overwhelming. The only uncertainty is definitional/data quality risk (~2%). I set probability at 98%.

Probability: 98%
