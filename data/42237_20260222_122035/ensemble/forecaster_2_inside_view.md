Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **The Independent, Feb 22, 2026** – Major UK outlet citing IOM/MMP directly. Key factual claim: 567 Mediterranean deaths across all routes in early 2026; 501 on Central Mediterranean alone. High quality, named institutional source (IOM spokesperson). Published today.

2. **Vatican News, Feb 3, 2026** – Reputable outlet citing NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans and Rome MRCC. Factual: ~380 people missing per MRCC as of Jan 24; Cyclone Harry context. NGO estimates of ~1,000 missing are opinions/estimates, not confirmed IOM data. Moderate-high quality.

3. **Al Jazeera, Feb 22, 2026** – Major international outlet. Factual: 5 bodies Libya, 3+ bodies Greece (Feb 21 incident); IOM Feb 9 report of 53 dead/missing off Zuwara; IOM January figure of "at least 375 dead or missing." High quality.

4. **Le Monde, Feb 12, 2026** – Prestigious French outlet (paywalled). Key factual claim: 524 dead/missing Jan 1–Feb 10, 2026, per IOM. Benchmarked against 219 in same period 2025. High quality.

5. **AFP via Middle East Monitor, Feb 10, 2026** – Wire service (AFP) citing IOM directly. Factual: 53 dead/missing off Libya Feb 6; IOM running total of 484 on Central Mediterranean route by Feb 10. High quality.

6. **AFP via Migrant charities article, Feb 20, 2026** – Wire service. Key factual claim: "IOM reported that at least 567 migrant lives have been lost in the central Mediterranean so far in 2026." This is the most recent IOM figure cited, as of ~Feb 20.

7. **Daijiworld/YesPunjab/VRT, Feb 21-22, 2026** – Multiple outlets reporting the Crete capsizing (Feb 21): 5 confirmed dead, ~20 missing, ~50 on board. Consistent across sources. Moderate-high quality.

8. **Free Malaysia Today/Euronews, Jan 26, 2026** – Citing IOM spokesperson Jorge Galindo. Factual: 104 confirmed/feared deaths from three shipwrecks Jan 23-25; nine missing boats with ~380 people. High quality.

9. **The New Humanitarian, Oct 2025** – Historical context only: UNHCR recorded 1,000+ Central Mediterranean deaths by late October 2025. Useful for annual baseline.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **IOM official figure of 567 deaths/missing by ~Feb 20, 2026** (cited by AFP/The Independent). This is a hard data point from the primary resolution source. With ~38 days remaining (Feb 22 – Mar 31), only 333 more deaths are needed.
- **Historical death rate**: At 567 deaths in ~51 days (Jan 1 – Feb 20), the rate is ~11.1 deaths/day. At this pace, 38 more days would add ~422 deaths, reaching ~989 total. Even at a significantly reduced rate of 8/day, 38 days adds 304, reaching 871 — still close.
- **Ongoing incidents**: Feb 21 Crete capsizing (5 dead, ~20 missing) adds immediately to the count. Libya bodies also being found. These are real-time confirmations of continued mortality.
- **Structural factors**: Cyclone Harry aftermath, departures from Sfax continuing, limited SAR capacity, aid budget cuts all persist. No policy change imminent.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Seasonal pattern**: March typically sees increased crossings as weather improves, potentially increasing death counts. This supports continued or accelerating pace.
- **IOM reporting lag**: IOM sometimes takes days to weeks to log incidents. The Feb 21 Crete incident (5+ dead, 20 missing) likely not yet in the dataset. This means the true current total is likely higher than 567.
- **"Invisible shipwrecks"**: IOM explicitly warns that many deaths go unrecorded. This means official counts are underestimates, but the question resolves on official IOM data.

**Weak evidence:**
- **NGO estimate of ~1,000 missing from Cyclone Harry**: This is an NGO estimate, not confirmed IOM data. Some of these may eventually be logged, but uncertain.
- **Weather improvement**: If Mediterranean conditions calm dramatically in March, crossing attempts might increase but so might survival rates.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Timeframe**: Feb 22 to Mar 31, 2026 = 37 days remaining.
- **Current IOM total**: ~567 deaths/missing by ~Feb 20 (with Feb 21 Crete incident likely adding 5-25 more, so ~572-592 by today).
- **Gap to threshold**: ~308-328 more deaths needed.
- **Required rate**: ~8.3-8.9 deaths/day for the remaining period.
- **Current observed rate**: ~11.1/day (Jan 1–Feb 20).

If timeframe were halved (only ~18 days remaining): Would need ~17-18/day — much harder, probability drops to ~55-65%.
If timeframe were doubled (~74 days): Would need only ~4.4/day — near certain, probability ~99%.

At 37 days, the question is whether the current pace (11/day) will slow enough to miss the threshold. Even a 25% slowdown to ~8.3/day would barely hit the threshold. A 50% slowdown to ~5.5/day would fall short (~204 additional, total ~776).

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate of 92% was established from historical Q1 patterns and the Jan 1–Feb 10 anchor of 524 deaths. The updated IOM figure of 567 by ~Feb 20 (with Feb 21 incidents not yet logged) strengthens this further.

Key factors:
1. **Hard data anchor**: 567 official IOM deaths by ~Feb 20, needing only 333 more in 37 days.
2. **Current pace**: ~11/day observed rate; even at 9/day, the threshold is reached.
3. **Continued incidents**: Feb 21 Crete (5-25 deaths/missing), Libya bodies, ongoing departures.
4. **Structural persistence**: No SAR improvement, no policy change, continued smuggler activity.
5. **Reporting lag risk**: The main risk is IOM not logging late-March incidents before April 1 resolution. This is a real but modest risk (~5-8%).

The main scenario for "No" resolution: a dramatic reduction in crossings AND deaths in March (e.g., extreme weather paradoxically stopping departures) combined with IOM reporting delays. This seems unlikely given March is typically more active than January-February.

**Probability Calibration**

Starting from 92% outside view:
- The updated IOM figure (567 by Feb 20 vs. 524 by Feb 10 assumed in outside view) slightly strengthens the case → nudge up ~1-2%.
- Feb 21 Crete incident adds more deaths not yet logged → nudge up ~1%.
- Reporting lag risk for late March events → nudge down ~2%.
- Net: ~92-93%.

I'll set my inside view at **93%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will IOM's Mediterranean dataset show ≥900 dead+missing for Jan 1–Mar 31, 2026? Current total ~567 by Feb 20; need ~333 more in 37 days.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 92%. Current evidence (567 confirmed, 11/day pace, ongoing incidents) supports this or slightly higher.

3. **Consistency check**: "93 out of 100 times, IOM records ≥900 Mediterranean deaths before April 2026." Given 567 already logged with 37 days at 11/day pace, this makes sense.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - IOM official figure: 567 deaths by ~Feb 20 (strong, direct source)
   - Current death rate: ~11/day, threshold requires ~9/day (strong, quantitative)
   - Feb 21 Crete capsizing: 5+ dead, 20+ missing, not yet logged (moderate)
   - Structural factors (no SAR improvement, continued departures) persist (strong)
   - IOM reporting lag risk for late-March events (moderate, downward)

5. **Blind spot**: A massive, sustained weather event in March that halts all crossings for 3+ weeks, combined with IOM logging delays for late-February incidents. This could push the total below 900. Probability of this scenario: ~5-7%.

6. **Status quo**: The current trend (high mortality, ongoing crossings, structural drivers) is the status quo. Slight nudge toward status quo continuation supports Yes.

Probability: 93%
