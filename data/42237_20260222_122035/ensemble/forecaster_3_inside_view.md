Analysis:
**1) Paraphrase / resolution criteria (be precise)**
Resolves **Yes** if the IOM Missing Migrants Project incident dataset shows **≥900 dead+missing in the “Mediterranean” region during this question’s window (from forecast opening 2026-02-22 through end of 2026-03-31)**.

## (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; date; facts vs opinions)

1) **The Independent (Feb 22, 2026)**  
- **Quality/date:** Reputable outlet; published today; summarizes IOM/MMP figures.  
- **Factual claims used:** “567 Mediterranean deaths in early 2026”; “501 on central route in first weeks”; “deadliest January globally.”  
- **Opinion/interpretation:** Claims about deterrence policies increasing risk; plausible but not directly resolution-relevant.

2) **Vatican News (Feb 3, 2026)**  
- **Quality/date:** Mainstream but relies heavily on NGO and survivor testimony.  
- **Factual claims used:** Storm “Cyclone Harry” context; official MRCC “380 missing as of Jan 24” mentioned.  
- **Uncertainty:** “Up to 1,000 feared missing” is **not** IOM-confirmed; higher noise.

3) **Al Jazeera (Feb 22, 2026)**  
- **Quality/date:** Strong international reporting; today; cites IOM statements and local authorities.  
- **Factual claims used:** IOM January central Med “375 dead or missing”; continued incidents (bodies recovered; Crete capsize).  
- **Opinion:** Policy critique elements are secondary.

4) **Le Monde (Feb 12, 2026; partially paywalled)**  
- **Quality/date:** High-quality outlet; but we only see partial content.  
- **Factual claims used:** “524 dead/missing Jan 1–Feb 10 across Mediterranean routes.”  
- **Opinion:** “Worst start” attributed to IOM spokesperson—useful but not decisive.

5) **AFP syndications (Feb 20–22, 2026, via multiple pickups in the feed)**  
- **Quality/date:** Very high for incident reporting and attributed institutional figures.  
- **Factual claims used:** Repeats IOM totals and ongoing body recoveries; provides the cleanest “institution says X” numbers.

6) **Other pickups / lower-clarity sources (e.g., Streamline Feed; Notizie.it; Daijiworld; etc.)**  
- **Quality/date:** Mixed; often republishing wire content; use mainly for corroborating that incidents continue, not for totals.

**Key meta-point for forecasting:** Most strong numbers in these sources refer to **January/early February**—which may **not** count toward resolution because the question explicitly states **events before 2026-02-22 do not count**.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

### Strong evidence
1) **Baseline pace evidence (IOM-cited totals):** Multiple independent reputable sources (AFP/Al Jazeera/Independent/Le Monde) indicate **very high death counts in early 2026** and continued incidents. This supports a **high ongoing hazard rate**.  
2) **Structural volatility / fat tails:** Mediterranean death totals are driven by rare, large disasters (boats with 100–600+). This heavy-tailed process means “900 in ~5.5 weeks” is unlikely but not impossible.

### Moderate evidence
1) **Ongoing incident flow in Feb:** Crete capsize + bodies washing ashore Libya/Italy indicates deaths are **not** abating. Supports “hundreds more” by end-March.  
2) **Mechanism claims (enforcement → riskier routes):** plausible and consistent with prior years, but hard to quantify for a 38-day threshold event.

### Weak evidence
1) **“Up to 1,000 feared missing” (Cyclone Harry NGO estimates):** important for humanitarian context, but uncertain and (crucially) mostly tied to **mid-January incidents**, likely **outside** the eligible window.

---

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** From **today (2026-02-22)** to **end of March** is ~**38 days**.  
- **What must happen for Yes (math):** Need **≥900 deaths in ~38 days**, i.e. about **24 deaths/day** on average.  
- **Halved window (~19 days):** would require ~47/day; I’d drop probability sharply (single-digit %) because only an extreme mass-casualty event would do it.  
- **Doubled window (~76 days):** threshold much more attainable; probability would rise a lot (potentially ~40–60%), because the required average rate falls to ~12/day and spring usually brings more crossings.

---

## (d) Justification (inside view vs outside view; what changes)
**Outside view base rate you provided (97.5%) implicitly treated the threshold as nearly already met by mid-February** because it used Jan–Feb deaths. The key inside-view correction is **the tournament fine print**: *events before opening (2026-02-22) do not count*. That makes the earlier “already at ~524+ by Feb 10” evidence largely **non-counting** for resolution.

So the question becomes: **Will the Mediterranean record ≥900 dead+missing from Feb 22 through Mar 31?**  
- **Status quo continuation:** If early-2026 “high but not unprecedented daily flow” continues (say ~10–15/day), we get roughly **380–570** additional deaths—well short of 900.  
- **What drives a Yes:** Requires either (i) **one or two very large disasters** (hundreds dead/missing), plus baseline flow; or (ii) a step-change to sustained ~25/day, which historically is hard to maintain without repeated multi-hundred fatal incidents.  
- **What drives a No:** No single “mega-shipwreck” and only typical winter/early-spring incident rates → totals likely in the mid-hundreds.

**Net effect:** Compared to the (misaligned) outside-view number, I make a large downward adjustment because the **eligible time window is short and the required run-rate is extremely high**. However, I keep probability above “tiny” because the process is heavy-tailed and 2026 has already shown conditions conducive to mass-fatality events (storms, “invisible shipwrecks,” etc.).

---

Probability calibration
- Starting point (conceptual): For “≥900 Mediterranean deaths in ~38 days,” the historical base rate is **low** (these are extreme short-window totals).  
- Updates:
  - **Upward:** 2026 is tracking as an unusually deadly year; multiple credible sources confirm continued incidents; fat-tail risk.  
  - **Downward:** Need ~24/day average; absent a mega-event, status quo likely yields ~400–600.

**Inside view probability:** **14%**

(Interpretation: I expect “No” most of the time, but a non-trivial chance of one catastrophic incident or a cluster pushing totals past 900.)

Checklist:
1) **Criteria check:** Yes if IOM MMP Mediterranean dead+missing **in the eligible window (from 2026-02-22 through 2026-03-31)** totals ≥900.  
2) **Outside view base rate (given):** 97.5% (but it relied on pre-2/22 deaths that likely don’t count).  
3) **Consistency line:** **14 out of 100 times**, IOM MMP records **≥900 Mediterranean deaths** in the eligible window before April 1, 2026.  
4) **Top evidence (3–5):**
   - Multiple reputable outlets cite very high early-2026 Mediterranean deaths and ongoing incidents (AFP/Al Jazeera/Independent/Le Monde).  
   - Window is ~38 days; threshold implies ~24 deaths/day—very high.  
   - Mediterranean deaths are fat-tailed; a single mega-shipwreck can add hundreds.  
   - Continued winter/spring crossings + enforcement dynamics keep baseline nonzero/high.  
5) **Blind spot:** If IOM logs a large number of “missing” incidents with **incident dates inside the window** (or date-uncertain cases assigned late Feb/Mar), totals could jump and my forecast would be too low.  
6) **Status quo outcome:** Without a mega-disaster, totals likely end in the **hundreds**, not 900 → nudges toward **No**.

Probability: 14%
