**Clarifying forecast criteria**

I need to evaluate how the question counts events after the opening date of February 22. It's clear that deaths recorded before this date won't count toward the resolution. So, only deaths from February 22 to March 31 are relevant. But there’s a conflict when the resolution mentions a year-to-date total through March 2026, which typically would include earlier data. I need to reconcile this by treating the starting point as zero from February 22, but I'm unsure how that fits with the overall year-to-date approach.**Assessing death counts**

I have to exclude deaths before February 22 for this question, focusing on the period from February 22 to March 31. The instructions stress that non-counted events must be ignored, which complicates the analysis since the dataset starts cumulatively from January 1. I'm essentially wondering if deaths from February 22 to March 31 can reach or exceed 900. Historically, the winter-spring cycle sees fewer deaths, needing about 24 deaths per day, which seems quite challenging to achieve—unless an extreme event occurs.**Estimating probabilities of deaths**

I think the probability of reaching 900 deaths might be around 20-30%, but I need to investigate further. The dataset could reflect over 900 deaths by February 22 if a cyclone contributed significantly, but those would be excluded. I need to look at previous years to estimate deaths from February 22 to March 31. For example, if 2016 had a huge spike in deaths, it might show potential as a baseline. Recent news about Cyclone Harry suggests many are missing, but I’m uncertain if the incident date affects what counts.**Understanding incident dates and counting**

It seems that the IOM dataset likely uses the incident date for recording deaths, which means deaths before February 22 wouldn’t count. However, if the incident date is unknown and set as the discovery date, it could be after February 22. There’s also uncertainty regarding how to interpret "events before opening do not count." Essentially, we're supposed to focus on deaths from February 22 onward while still considering the year-to-date total, which feels inconsistent with the rules.**Evaluating death thresholds and probabilities**

I think they might indicate that if the threshold for deaths was met before the opening, it wouldn’t automatically resolve. However, they would still use the year-to-date sum as of the end of March. If there are already 567 deaths by February 22, those wouldn't count. The forecast now hinges on whether at least 900 deaths can occur between February 22 and March 31. With an observed pace of about 13 deaths per day, we'd need around 23.7 daily, which seems tough unless a major tragedy strikes. I estimate the probability could be around 15%.
