Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source contributes; quality; facts vs opinions)

1) **ECRE article (re: 2024 deaths; Cyprus/Greece/Italy/Malta policy/legal context)**  
- **Date/quality:** Secondary policy-focused NGO roundup; generally credible for policy/legal developments but *not a primary mortality dataset*.  
- **Useful facts:** Only that 2024 had “large numbers” of deaths; no specific IOM Q1 totals provided in the excerpt.  
- **Opinions:** Implied critiques of state practices (pushbacks, SAR policy), but not quantified for this question.

2) **Euronews (Jan 26, 2026) citing IOM**  
- **Date/quality:** Reputable media; cites **named IOM staff**, which is strong.  
- **Useful facts:** Mentions severe early-2026 shipwrecks, missing boats, and recalls **2025 Central Med deaths (~1,340)**.  
- **Opinions:** “Final toll may be significantly higher” is an IOM caution—credible but not a precise count.

3) **Al Jazeera (Feb 22, 2026) citing IOM**  
- **Date/quality:** Reputable international outlet; mixes incident reporting with IOM statements.  
- **Useful facts:** Mentions IOM statement that **January had at least 375 dead/missing** in central Med; also references a Feb 9 IOM statement (53 dead/missing off Libya).  
- **Opinions:** “Hundreds more believed unrecorded” is plausible but inherently uncertain.

4) **Vatican News (Feb 3, 2026) with NGO commentary**  
- **Date/quality:** Mixed; some official references (MRCC) plus heavy reliance on NGO claims/testimonies.  
- **Useful facts:** Reports **MRCC had 380 missing** as of Jan 24 (an official-sounding figure).  
- **Opinions:** NGO leader statements about “unprecedented tragedy” and undercounting are advocacy-informed; directionally useful but not a hard basis for outside-view baserates.

5) **The New Humanitarian roundup (Oct 2025)**  
- **Date/quality:** Generally credible humanitarian reporting; not a primary dataset.  
- **Useful facts:** Confirms deadly shipwrecks and notes **>1,000 deaths in central Med in 2025 (by Oct)** per UNHCR.  
- **Opinions:** Policy critique context; not directly predictive of Q1 thresholds.

6) **Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor (advocacy org) summary**  
- **Date/quality:** Advocacy organization; may quote real incidents and sometimes IOM numbers, but higher risk of motivated framing.  
- **Useful facts (if accurate):** Claims **1,873** deaths in 2025 (consistent with other mentions) and cites a **Jan 1–Feb 5/10 2026** cumulative figure.  
- **Opinions:** Strong policy attributions; should not be treated as neutral evidence.

7) **Agent report (compiled; partly extrapolative)**  
- **Date/quality:** Mixed reliability. It blends credible-looking annual totals with **imputed Q1 estimates** and **rate extrapolations**. Treat the arithmetic as fine, but treat several “implied Q1 totals” as *assumptions*, not observations.  
- **Useful facts:** Collects annual totals and highlights that Q1 reaching 900 is historically unusual.  
- **Opinions/assumptions:** The Q1 projections (e.g., “~1,151”) are not outside-view baserates; they are essentially an inside-view trend extrapolation.

**Bottom line for outside view:** The cleanest historical anchors here are the **full-year Mediterranean totals** (2016–2025) and the general seasonal intuition that Q1 is typically *below* summer peaks. The early-2026 incident reporting is important later for inside view, but it is not the main ingredient for an outside-view base rate.

### (b) Reference class analysis (choose the most suitable)

**Candidate reference classes:**

1) **“Q1 Mediterranean dead+missing totals in IOM Missing Migrants, 2014–2025”**  
- **Best match in principle** (same metric, same geography, same months).  
- **Problem:** We don’t have a clean Q1-by-year table in the provided materials, only fragments and annual totals.

2) **“Annual Mediterranean dead+missing totals (2014–2025) + typical seasonality share for Q1”**  
- **Most usable with given data.** We *do* have annual totals and can apply a rough seasonal fraction to translate to a Q1 distribution.

3) **“Early-year (Jan–Mar) mortality in the Central Mediterranean specifically”**  
- Close but not identical: question is **Mediterranean (all subroutes)**, not only central.

**Selected reference class for outside view:** **(2)** Annual totals + typical Q1 share/seasonality. It’s less direct than (1) but is the most defensible with what we have.

### (c) Timeframe analysis (how long; what patterns matter)

- **Outcome window (as written in resolution criteria):** **Jan 1–Mar 31, 2026** (Q1), resolving **Apr 1, 2026**.  
- **From “today” (Feb 22, 2026) to end of March:** ~**37 days** remain, but outside view treats Q1 as a whole seasonal period.  
- **Seasonality (outside-view intuition):** Mediterranean crossings and fatalities often rise in **late spring/summer/early autumn**; **Q1 is usually not the peak**, though storms can produce episodic mass-casualty events. Therefore, **900 by end of March** is a *high* threshold historically.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view baseline)

Using annual totals as the anchor:

- Annual Mediterranean dead+missing totals (from the provided context) show a wide range: roughly **~1,400 to ~5,100** (2016–2025).  
- If we assume a rough seasonal share where **Q1 contributes ~15–30%** of annual deaths (wide but plausible given summer peaks), then:
  - For an annual year like **~1,873 (2025)**, a “typical” Q1 might be on the order of **~280–560**, well below 900.
  - To “typically” get **Q1 ≥ 900**, you’d expect an annual total perhaps **≥ 3,000–6,000** depending on the Q1 share—i.e., closer to the very high-mortality years.
- Over the last decade-plus, **extreme early-year spikes** are uncommon. Even in years with high annual totals (e.g., ~3,155 in 2023; ~2,452 in 2024 per the context), Q1 reaching 900 would be **not the default** unless there is a major cluster of disasters early in the year.

So, the outside-view baseline says: **crossing 900 by end of March is historically rare but not impossible**—it likely corresponds to unusually deadly winters or exceptional events (mass-shipwreck clusters, major SAR disruption, sudden route shifts).

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether point:** The best tether is the **historical annual totals** and the notion that **Q1 is usually below peak season**; that makes **900 by end of March** a “tail-ish” outcome.  
- **Base-rate estimate:** Given only one clearly “ultra-high” annual year in the provided list (2016 at ~5,136), and several moderately high years (~3,155 in 2023), I would put **Q1 ≥ 900** as something like a **~10–20%** event in the long-run distribution—rare but recurring occasionally.  
- **Upset/unexpected-outcome rate in this domain:** Counting/attribution noise exists (missing boats, later confirmations), and single disasters can move totals by hundreds. That increases variance and makes tail outcomes more common than a smooth model would suggest—nudging probability **upward** within that 10–20% band.  
- **Avoiding overconfidence:** Because we *don’t* have the actual Q1-by-year distribution here, I should not collapse to single digits; the uncertainty about seasonality and clustering argues for a mid-teens prior.
