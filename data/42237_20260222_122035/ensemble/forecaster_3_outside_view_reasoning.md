**Resolving timeframe for analysis**

I need to clarify how outside views work for this analysis. The resolution window starts on February 22, 2026, but any events before this date don’t count, even though the criteria say to assess data year-to-date through March 31, 2026. I find this contradictory! It seems that only incidents after February 22 will influence the outcome. So I’ll focus on deaths from February 22 onward but consider how earlier data fits into this criteria.**Interpreting resolution criteria**

I see that the resolution relies on the IOM dataset's year-to-date sum through the end of March, which includes January and February. However, there's a note saying that events before the opening won’t count. This is to prevent forecasters from using known events in competitions. It seems contradictory since the resolution will factor in data through March 31, but only deaths after February 22 are considered. I think the main criteria take precedence over the note, so I'll focus on year-to-date up to March 31.**Analyzing outcome expectations**

The question's title about recording at least 900 deaths in 2026 before April suggests I should consider data from January to March. Since today is February 22, much has already occurred, but I'm thinking about how to utilize both outside and inside views. To predict based on historical data, I plan to look at Q1 deaths from previous years. Typically, Q1 might account for 20-30% of annual totals. Given past trends, achieving a threshold of 900 in Q1 seems high, potentially requiring an annual total of over 3000-4000. I need to check how often Q1 medium deaths reached 900 from 2014-2025.**Estimating base rates for analysis**

I’m looking at annual totals and considering that if the annual deaths are below 2000, Q1 totals are likely under 500. Even if it exceeds 3000, Q1 might still fall below 900 due to seasonality. Only in 2016, with over 5000 deaths, did Q1 likely exceed 900. So, the base rate could be about 1 out of 12, roughly 8%. 

I need to consider early-year data since 2014, recognizing it’s probably rare, and include context. While the outside view should focus on historical data, I might consider early 2026 context without relying too heavily on it. I think 15% is a fair estimate.**Setting probability estimates**

I’m considering the outside view from the start of the year, even though the opening date is February 22. I realize that while generating predictions, I should factor in historical context, including early 2026 reports, but these might be seen as an inside view. 

For my analysis, I’m focusing on annual totals, using the timeframe from now until March 31, with an emphasis on Q1 as a whole. The threshold of 900 deaths by the end of March seems high unless extraordinary events occur. I estimate the probability at 14.9% based on yearly averages and potential winter disasters that could skew Q1 numbers.
