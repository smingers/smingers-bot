Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question and resolution criteria (≤30 words)  
IOM data must show ≥900 dead + missing on all Mediterranean routes for 1 Jan–31 Mar 2026 when checked on/after 1 Apr 2026.

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)

– The Independent, 22 Feb 2026: News outlet quoting IOM spokesperson and current MMP figures; gives 567 Mediterranean deaths “so far in 2026”.  Reliable, dated.

– AFP wire (multiple language pickups) 21-22 Feb 2026: Crete capsizing (≥5 dead, ≈20-25 missing).  Primary information from Hellenic Coast Guard.  Reliable incident reporting.

– Notizie.it & Daijiworld round-ups, 21-22 Feb 2026: Same Crete event, derivative of AFP; no new facts.  Medium quality.

– Vatican News, 3 Feb 2026: NGO Mediterranea claims up to 1,000 missing in Cyclone Harry; MRCC confirms 380 missing.  Mixture of official & advocacy figures.  Medium.

– Le Monde, 12 Feb 2026: Cites IOM that 524 deaths recorded 1 Jan–10 Feb 2026.  High-quality, named source.

– Al Jazeera, 9 Feb 2026 & Middle East Monitor, 10 Feb 2026: IOM press note on 53 deaths near Zuwara, Libya, and January total ≥375.  Credible (direct IOM quotation).

– Euronews/AFP, 26 Jan 2026: IOM warns of 104 confirmed deaths and ≈380 people on nine missing boats (Cyclone Harry).  High quality; emphasises investigations pending.

– 2025 articles (New Humanitarian, Jurist etc.): Historical context; not directly about 2026 tally.  Useful for trend baselines.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
• IOM-confirmed running total 567 deaths by 22 Feb 2026 (Independent, Le Monde).  
• IOM-confirmed 375 deaths in January (press note).  
• Crete incident adds ≥5 dead/≥20 missing already likely to be logged.

Moderate evidence  
• IOM investigation of nine boats, ≈380 missing (Euronews/AFP 26 Jan) – credible source but not yet in database.  
• NGO/MRCC claims of up to 1,000 missing (Vatican News) – independent but not yet validated.  
• Historical share of Q1 deaths ≈20 % of annual total (derived from prior-year MMP monthly data).

Weak evidence  
• General commentary on “invisible shipwrecks” and policy failures – raises under-count risk but speculative for March cut-off.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
37 days remain to 31 Mar 2026.

If timeframe were halved (to mid-March) probability would drop ~15 pp because less time for IOM to verify Cyclone Harry toll.  
If doubled (to end-April) probability would rise ~10 pp, as verification lag would likely capture missing-boat figures.

(d) Justification / inside-view update

Outside-view base rate (step 2) = 14.7 % for Q1 ≥900, based on 2014-25 seasonality.

Status quo trend:  
• 567 deaths in first 53 days = 10.7/day.  
• Need 333 more in next 37 days = 9.0/day; only slightly below YTD average.

Drivers toward YES  
1. Ongoing investigations of Cyclone Harry (≈380 missing) – if even 60 % are added by 31 Mar, threshold is crossed. (Moderate→Strong).  
2. Unusually deadly winter already (record January) suggests structural factors (poorer SAR, longer routes) raising baseline fatality rate (Strong).  
3. March historically sees >100 deaths even in average years; 2026 appears above-average (Moderate).  

Drivers toward NO  
1. IOM often needs weeks-months to confirm large “disappeared” counts; bureaucratic lag may push inclusion past 1 Apr 2026 (Moderate).  
2. Daily death rate fell sharply after 10 Feb (≈3–4/day 11-22 Feb); if milder weather persists, incremental deaths may stay low (Moderate).  
3. Threshold still 59 % above current confirmed figure; any recording delay or under-count blocks resolution (Strong).

Balancing these, I assign:

• 45 % chance that ≥280 of the 380 missing are logged by April 1, plus normal March deaths ⇒ YES.  
• 15 % chance that only part of Harry toll is logged but new incidents push total over 900 ⇒ YES.  
Total YES = 60 %.  
Remaining 40 % covers scenarios where verification lags or March proves quiet.

Probability calibration

“60 out of 100 times, IOM data would show ≥900 Mediterranean deaths by 31 Mar 2026.”

A ±10 pp shift meaningfully affects odds (from 1.5 : 1 to 1 : 1 or 2 : 1). Given evidence quality and short timeframe, ±10 pp reflects my 80 % credible interval.

Checklist:
1. Title & criteria paraphrased ✔  
2. Outside-view base rate 14.7 % ✔ — final answer tied to big observed deviation.  
3. Consistency line above ✔  
4. Top evidence:  
   – 567 deaths logged by 22 Feb (IOM).  
   – IOM investigating nine missing boats ≈380 pax.  
   – Record-high January (375 deaths).  
   – Sharp fall in daily rate mid-Feb.  
   – IOM verification often slow.  
5. Blind-spot: IOM delays all Cyclone Harry counts until mid-April; probability would drop to ~35 %.  
6. Status-quo (no large Harry update, average March) leads to <900; nudged probability slightly downward before final.

Probability: 60%
