**Forecasting mortality figures**

I need to develop a forecast based on data I have. The IOM MMP recorded about 567 deaths in the Mediterranean as of February 22, 2026. Incidents post-February 9 could push this number to around 600. To reach a threshold of 900 deaths by March 31, we need roughly 300 more in the next 37 days, averaging about 8 deaths a day. While early spring storms could contribute to this, it's not guaranteed. The dataset includes dead and missing, with potential updates after the quarter ends.**Assessing mortality data**

I need to consider the dataset as of April 1, which would quickly capture any backfilled incidents. Generally, MMP updates can lag, but major events are likely recorded. I'm assessing the probability of recording at least 300 more deaths between February 22 and March 31, alongside catching up on earlier missing events. Factors to consider include storm season volatility, ongoing search and rescue issues, and the baseline fatalities in early 2026, which are quite high compared to previous years.**Modeling mortality rates**

I’ve noticed that the death rate dropped after early February, so I’ll need to consider volatility in modeling the underlying numbers. For instance, there were 375 deaths in January and 524 by February 10, which suggests lower averages since then. While March may see calmer conditions, historically, it could yield around 150 deaths. However, if IOM confirms unrecorded missing persons, that could significantly impact totals. I’m leaning towards a probability estimate of around 58% for reaching the threshold of 900 deaths by March 31.**Crafting the analysis**

I'm working on creating a structured analysis with several sections. First, I’ll summarize key sources to provide a solid foundation for my findings. Next, I need to assess and weight the evidence presented in these sources. I'll also consider the timeframe of the data to ensure it's relevant. After that, I’ll provide justification for my conclusions. Finally, I’ll calibrate the probabilities based on the evidence and create a checklist to ensure all points are covered. Let’s get started!
