**Forecasting deaths**

I'm trying to forecast based on outside factors. There’s strong evidence from the agent report indicating 524 deaths by February 10, which is a high rate. We have 49 days until March 31, needing 376 more deaths to hit 900. Several articles mention 375 deaths in January and 524 by February 10, with additional bodies found by February 22. For analysis, I need to evaluate each source carefully, consider previous death totals for comparison, and confirm the timeline from February 22 to March 31, which is indeed 38 days.**Calculating forecast days and probabilities**

I need to figure out the days in February during a non-leap year, which means February has 28 days. From February 22, there are 6 days left in February. Including March, I’m looking at a total of 38 days until the end of March. I want to justify a probability estimate, possibly around 94% to 96%. 

I must consider risks like IOM recording lags and ensure the dataset reflects at least 900 deaths by the end of March. Historical data shows variable ratios, and for 2016, the February to Q1 ratio is about 0.52, suggesting caution in predictions.**Crafting the prediction analysis**

For 2026, I see a figure of 524 deaths thus far, suggesting that for the first quarter, with a rough estimate based on a ratio of 0.5, we could predict around 1,050 deaths, which is above 900. There's uncertainty in the ratio, so I’m considering a range between 850 to 1,100. 

While there could be significant early deaths due to cyclones, improved weather could slow down departures. However, crossings in the central Mediterranean often increase in spring, which presents a minimal risk. I'm thinking a probability estimate might be around 93%. Let's work on refining this analysis further.
