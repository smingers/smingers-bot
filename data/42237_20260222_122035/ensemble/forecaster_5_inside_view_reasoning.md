**Analyzing death rates**

I need to craft an analysis to determine the probability. The outside view predicts a 67% chance based on data that considered 524 deaths up until February 10. New information as of February 22 shows 567 deaths, meaning the pace continues. There were also recent incidents, especially in Crete, with confirmed deaths and many missing. Now, looking ahead to the end of March, I need to find out how many more deaths would be needed to reach 900. That comes to about 8.5 deaths per day, which seems plausible.**Updating probability analysis**

The policy environment hasn't changed much, and search and rescue efforts are still limited. There might be some invisible shipwrecks that are recorded slowly. I note that the question involves the IOM dataset, which updates with some delay for major incidents. There's a risk not all deaths will be counted before April 1, though early-year deaths like from Cyclone Harry may take longer to log. 

I think I could raise my predicted probability from 67% to around 70%, considering factors like potential undercounting or delays, and the influence of Ramadan starting on February 18, 2026, which could slightly lower departure rates. Examining historical data, Ramadan has historically decreased crossings but not halted them entirely. If I expect around 918 deaths based on my model, I can estimate the probability of reaching at least 900 deaths to be about 72%. Let’s put this analysis into a structured format.
