Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Resolution window interpretation — does it start Jan 1 or Feb 22?**
This is the single largest source of divergence. Forecaster_3 (14%) interprets the resolution criteria as counting only deaths from Feb 22 onward (the "Forecast Opening Date"), meaning the ~567 deaths already recorded don't count and 900 new deaths would need to occur in ~38 days. Forecasters 1, 2, 4, and 5 interpret it as a year-to-date (Jan 1–Mar 31) cumulative total, meaning the 567 already recorded count toward the 900 threshold. This single interpretation difference accounts for roughly 50-80 percentage points of the spread.

**Disagreement 2: How many of the ~380 "missing" from Cyclone Harry / unconfirmed boats will be logged by April 1?**
Forecasters 1 and 2 (93-98%) assume the current pace (~11-15/day) will continue and that enough incidents are already in the pipeline. Forecaster 4 (60%) and Forecaster 5 (72%) explicitly model the risk that IOM verification lags could delay logging of large "missing" counts past April 1. This disagreement affects predictions by roughly 20-30 percentage points among the forecasters who agree on the resolution window.

**Disagreement 3: Current daily death rate and whether it has slowed.**
Forecaster 4 notes a "sharp fall in daily rate mid-Feb (≈3–4/day 11-22 Feb)" while Forecasters 1 and 2 cite an overall pace of 11-15/day. This factual disagreement about the recent trajectory affects whether the remaining ~333 deaths are easily achievable or require significant new incidents.

Root Causes:

1. **Resolution window**: Different interpretation of resolution criteria. The "Fine print" note says "Events before this date do not count toward resolution" referring to Feb 22, but the question text says "year-to-date sum of dead plus missing through the end of March 2026." These are contradictory, and forecasters split on which to follow. This is a criteria interpretation issue, not a factual one — but checking the actual IOM dataset structure could clarify whether YTD is the only available metric.

2. **IOM verification lag for missing persons**: Different factual beliefs about IOM's data processing speed and whether large "missing" counts from recent incidents will appear in the dataset by April 1. This is verifiable.

3. **Recent daily death rate**: Different factual beliefs about whether the rate has slowed in mid-February. This is verifiable by checking recent IOM data updates.
