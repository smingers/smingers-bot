Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Resolution window interpretation): RESOLVED — supports the majority view (Jan 1 start)**

This is the most critical disagreement. Forecaster_3 interpreted the question as only counting deaths from Feb 22 onward, based on the metadata note "Events before this date do not count toward resolution." However, the actual resolution criteria clearly state: "This question resolves to Yes if the IOM Missing Migrants Project incident dataset shows that the **year-to-date sum** of dead plus missing through the end of March 2026 for 'Mediterranean' is at least 900."

The phrase "year-to-date sum" unambiguously means January 1 through March 31. The metadata note about the "Forecast Opening Date" refers to when forecasting opens, not to the resolution window itself. The resolution criteria explicitly define what counts. The IOM dataset tracks cumulative YTD figures, and the question asks about that YTD sum. Forecaster_3's interpretation is incorrect. This resolves the ~50-80 percentage point disagreement firmly in favor of the majority (forecasters 1, 2, 4, 5).

**Disagreement 2 (IOM verification lag for missing persons): PARTIALLY RESOLVED**

The research confirms that as of late January, IOM was still investigating nine missing boats carrying ~380 people from Cyclone Harry. The agent report confirms significant data lag — the Cyclone Harry incidents from January 14-25 were still being verified as of January 26. However, by February 22, the confirmed total had risen to 567, suggesting substantial verification has occurred. The question is whether the remaining unverified deaths will be logged by April 1. The research shows IOM does eventually add these, but the timeline is uncertain. This supports the moderate concern raised by forecasters 4 and 5.

**Disagreement 3 (Current daily death rate): PARTIALLY RESOLVED**

The data shows: 524 by Feb 10, 533 by Feb 16, 567 by Feb 22. From Feb 10-22 (12 days), ~43 deaths were added, or ~3.6/day. This confirms forecaster_4's observation that the daily rate slowed significantly in mid-February compared to January's pace. However, the overall YTD average remains ~10.7/day (567/53 days).

Updated Analysis:

With the resolution window confirmed as Jan 1–Mar 31 YTD, the question becomes: will the IOM dataset show ≥900 Mediterranean dead+missing by end of March 2026?

**Current position:** 567 confirmed by Feb 22. Need 333 more in 37 days (Feb 23–Mar 31), requiring ~9.0 deaths/day.

**Key considerations:**

1. The overall YTD pace is ~10.7/day, well above the required 9.0/day. Even with the mid-February slowdown to ~3.6/day, this likely reflects a temporary lull rather than a permanent shift.

2. March historically sees increased crossings as weather improves, typically generating more deaths than winter months. Multiple sources confirm structural factors (longer routes, reduced SAR capacity) persist.

3. At the reduced mid-February rate of ~3.6/day, only ~133 additional deaths would be logged in 37 days, reaching ~700 — well short of 900. However, this rate is anomalously low and unlikely to persist through all of March.

4. There are likely still unverified Cyclone Harry deaths that could be added to the dataset, potentially providing a significant boost.

5. The IOM verification lag is a real risk — late March incidents may not be logged by April 1.

**Scenario analysis:**
- If March returns to the January pace (~12/day): 567 + 37×12 = 1,011 → YES
- If pace averages ~9/day (moderate): 567 + 37×9 = 900 → barely YES
- If pace stays at mid-Feb levels (~4/day): 567 + 37×4 = 715 → NO
- If pace is ~7/day (between slow Feb and normal March): 567 + 37×7 = 826 → NO

The mid-February slowdown is concerning but likely temporary. March weather improvements typically increase both crossings and deaths. The required rate (9/day) is below the YTD average (10.7/day) but above the recent rate (3.6/day).

Balancing these factors: the strong YTD pace, likely March increase, potential Cyclone Harry backfill, against the mid-February slowdown and verification lag risks, I estimate approximately 80% probability.

The weighted average of 67.4% is pulled down significantly by forecaster_3's incorrect resolution window interpretation (14%). Removing that outlier and reweighting gives approximately 80-85%. The mid-February slowdown and verification lag concerns justify some discount from the highest estimates (93-98%), landing around 82%.
