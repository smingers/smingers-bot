## Summary of IOM Missing Migrants Project Article

**Disclaimer:** This article appears to be a general overview/background page about the IOM Missing Migrants Project rather than a data-specific report. It does not contain specific 2025 or 2026 Mediterranean death statistics relevant to the forecasting question.

### Key Facts:

- **Project Purpose:** Records incidents in which migrants (including refugees and asylum-seekers) have died at state borders or during international migration journeys.
- **Origin:** Developed in response to disparate global reports of migrant deaths, particularly following two October 2013 shipwrecks near Lampedusa that killed at least **368 people**.
- **Database Status:** Hosts the **only existing open-access global database** of migration-related deaths.
- **Policy Relevance:** Informs **SDG Indicator 10.7.3** (number of people who died/disappeared during migration) and **Global Compact on Migration Objective 8** (saving lives and coordinating efforts on missing migrants).
- **Scale:** More than **40,000 people** have lost their lives during unsafe migration journeys since 2014.
- **Funding:** Supported by Switzerland's FDFA, Germany's BMI, and previously UK Aid.
- **Data License:** Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

### Notable Absence:
The article contains **no specific regional breakdowns, annual totals, or recent incident data** that would directly inform the forecasting question about 2026 Mediterranean deaths.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: What is the current IOM Missing Migrants Project year-to-date total for Mediterranean dead and missing as of late February 2026, and does the dataset allow filtering by incident date to show only incidents from February 22 onward? Also, have the missing persons from recent large incidents (e.g., boats lost during storms in early-mid February) been added to the dataset yet?
## IOM Missing Migrants Project: Mediterranean 2026 Deaths — Comprehensive Analysis

### Year-to-Date Totals as of Late February 2026

Based on multiple credible sources, the following timeline of Mediterranean dead and missing figures can be reconstructed:

- **As of January 26, 2026**: The IOM warned of "hundreds" potentially missing, with at least 104 deaths confirmed from three shipwrecks on January 23–25 (Euronews, January 26, 2026). At least 380 people were reported missing at sea as of January 24 from the Cyclone Harry-related incidents alone (Vatican News, February 3, 2026).

- **As of February 9, 2026**: The IOM confirmed at least **484** migrants dead or missing in the Mediterranean year-to-date (CBS News, February 9, 2026; Vatican News, February 9, 2026). This figure followed the February 6 capsizing off Zuwara, Libya, which added 53 dead or missing.

- **As of February 10, 2026**: Le Monde reported at least **524** dead or missing across all Mediterranean routes from January 1 to February 10, citing IOM data directly.

- **As of February 16, 2026**: The Independent reported **533** deaths confirmed in the Mediterranean year-to-date, citing direct confirmation from the IOM's Missing Migrants Project. The article also noted that January 2026 alone saw at least **375** dead or missing in the Central Mediterranean.

- **As of February 22, 2026**: The Independent's follow-up article (dated February 22, 2026) reported **567** migrants killed across all three Mediterranean routes (Central, Eastern, and Western) year-to-date. This figure encompasses the Central Mediterranean route (at least 501 deaths on that route alone), the Eastern Mediterranean (Turkey-Greece), and the Western Mediterranean (North Africa-Spain).

### Key Incidents Driving the Toll

1. **Cyclone Harry (mid-to-late January 2026)**: Multiple boats departed from Tunisia (Sfax area) during the storm. Italian authorities estimated up to **380 people** may have drowned in a single week. NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans cited survivor testimonies suggesting up to **1,000** may have been lost, though this figure remains unverified. Only one boat is confirmed to have reached Lampedusa (January 22). These are described as "invisible shipwrecks" — many may never be officially confirmed.

2. **January 23–25 shipwrecks**: Three confirmed wrecks involving boats from Tunisia and Libya, with at least 104 deaths (IOM, via Euronews).

3. **February 6, 2026 — Zuwara capsizing**: A rubber dinghy carrying 55 migrants (including two babies) capsized off the Libyan coast north of Zuwara. Only two Nigerian women survived. **53 dead or missing**, including both babies (IOM, UN News, BBC, CBS News).

4. **February 4, 2026 — Greek coast guard collision**: A speedboat carrying migrants collided with a Greek coast guard vessel off Chios, killing at least **15 people** (CBS News, February 4, 2026).

### Dataset Filtering Capability

The IOM Missing Migrants Project public dataset (available at missingmigrants.iom.int) is structured by incident date and region, allowing users to filter by both parameters. The GitHub repository (yotkadata/missing-migrants) confirms the dataset contains more than 13,000 individual incidents, each tagged with date and region. The IOM's public-facing interface allows filtering by region ("Mediterranean") and by year/date range, meaning filtering to show only incidents from February 22 onward is technically feasible within the dataset's interface. However, no search result directly confirms the exact UI functionality for sub-monthly date filtering as of late February 2026.

### Data Lag and Underreporting Concerns

A critical issue is the significant lag between incidents occurring and their formal entry into the IOM dataset:

- The Cyclone Harry incidents from January 14–25 were still being verified as of January 26 (Euronews). Many of the estimated 380+ missing from that period may not yet be formally entered as confirmed deaths.
- IOM staff explicitly acknowledge that figures are "almost certainly an underestimate," with thousands likely dying in areas with limited reporting (The Independent, February 16 and 22, 2026).
- The IOM spokesperson noted "invisible shipwrecks" where no trace is ever found, and that aid budget cuts are worsening documentation capacity.
- As of February 9, the IOM figure of 484 was described as the confirmed/verified total, while the actual toll from January's Cyclone Harry events alone could be far higher if all survivor testimonies are accurate.

### Assessment for the Forecasting Question (≥900 Mediterranean Deaths Before April 2026)

The question asks whether the IOM dataset will show ≥900 Mediterranean dead and missing through end of March 2026.

**Current trajectory strongly supports YES:**

- By February 22, the confirmed figure already stood at **567** (The Independent, February 22, 2026).
- The pace through the first 53 days of 2026 averages approximately **10.7 deaths per day** (567 ÷ 53 days).
- From February 22 to March 31 is an additional **37 days**. At the current average rate, that would add approximately **396 more deaths**, bringing the total to roughly **963** by end of March.
- Even at a significantly reduced rate (e.g., 9 deaths/day), the total would reach approximately **900** by late March.
- The 567 figure as of February 22 likely **understates** the true toll, as many Cyclone Harry "invisible shipwrecks" from January have not been formally confirmed. If even a portion of the estimated 380+ missing from that period are eventually added, the dataset total could jump substantially.
- January 2026 alone was the **deadliest January on record** since IOM began collecting data in 2014, with 699 global deaths (The Independent, February 16, 2026) and 375+ in the Central Mediterranean alone.
- 2026 is described as the deadliest year in the Mediterranean since IOM data collection began (as of mid-February 2026).

**Historical comparison**: In 2025, only 219 people died in the Mediterranean in the equivalent January 1–February 10 period (Le Monde). The 2026 figure of 524 for the same period represents a **139% increase** year-over-year.

**Conclusion**: Based on the confirmed trajectory of 567 deaths by February 22, 2026, and the strong average daily rate of ~10.7 deaths/day, the IOM Missing Migrants Project is highly likely to record at least 900 Mediterranean migrant deaths before April 2026. The probability is further elevated by the likelihood that additional Cyclone Harry victims will be formally added to the dataset as verification continues. The question resolves **Yes** with high confidence based on current data.</Agent_report>
