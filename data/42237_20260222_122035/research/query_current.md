The key to forecasting whether the death toll will reach 900 by 31 Mar 2026 is knowing the current 2026 year-to-date (YTD) figure and the pace at which fatalities are being added. Relevant information therefore includes:
• The IOM Missing Migrants Project’s official YTD count for the Mediterranean (usually updated weekly).
• News about any large shipwrecks or rescues with missing/dead tallies in Jan–Feb 2026.
• Commentary from IOM, UNHCR, NGOs, or coast-guard authorities on trends in crossings and mortality so far in 2026.
