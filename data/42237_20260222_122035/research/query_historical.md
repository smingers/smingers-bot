Analysis:
To judge whether Mediterranean deaths will reach 900 by the end of March 2026, the single most informative baseline is how many deaths the IOM Missing Migrants Project recorded by 31 March in previous years and what the running total is so far in 2026.  Historical year-to-date (Jan 1–Mar 31) tallies for 2016-2025 reveal large year-to-year variation—some years (e.g., 2017, 2021) barely broke 400, while others (e.g., 2023) exceeded 800—so knowing the exact figures provides the outside view.  In addition, up-to-the-minute news or IOM updates on 2026 deaths will show whether the current pace is on track for 900.  Therefore the search should:  
1) locate IOM pages or datasets listing Mediterranean dead/missing totals by date for several past years;  
2) capture recent news articles or IOM press releases with the 2026 running total;  
3) if possible, pull the data directly via an Agent query for faster aggregation.
