The 2026 pace is more than double 2025's early pace.\n\n7. **The only scenario for NO resolution** would require an essentially complete cessation of Mediterranean crossings and deaths for the entire remainder of Q1 2026 \u2014 an outcome with no historical precedent and contradicted by ongoing February 22 reports.\n\n**Probability assessment**: >97% that the 900-death threshold was crossed before April 1, 2026. The trajectory strongly suggests the actual Q1 2026 total will be in the range of 900\u20131,200+ deaths, with 900 likely crossed sometime in mid-to-late February 2026.</Agent_report>\n"
