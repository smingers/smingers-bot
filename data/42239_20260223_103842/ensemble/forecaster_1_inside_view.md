Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **CDC FluView Week 51 (2025)**: Official CDC surveillance report. Shows flu positivity increasing nationally, H3N2 dominant, Region 8 at 34.9% positivity. Factual/high quality. Dated early January 2026 (past). No cumulative burden estimates.

2. **CDC Flu Burden Page (Nov 21, 2025)**: Official CDC methodology page. States historical range of end-of-season hospitalizations (2010-2025) is **120,000–710,000**. Critical factual finding: even including 2024-25 (a high-severity season), the upper end of historical final estimates is 710,000. High quality.

3. **CDC 2025-26 Burden Data Page**: Official CDC source. Confirms weekly updates, Flu Surv-NET coverage ~10% of U.S. population. No specific numerical estimates captured. High quality but incomplete extraction.

4. **CDC FluVaxView (Feb 18, 2026)**: Official CDC vaccination dashboard. ~134.8M doses distributed, ~46-47% adult/child vaccination rates. Vaccination rates slightly higher than last season. High quality. Relevant as higher vaccination could moderate season severity.

5. **NBC News (Dec 30, 2025)**: Secondary news source. Reports 7.5M illnesses, hospitalizations nearly doubled in one week (19,053), ~3,100 deaths as of week ending Dec 20, 2025. Quotes multiple physicians noting season not near peak. Moderate quality.

6. **KSL/Reuters/Multiple outlets (Jan 5-6, 2026)**: Multiple independent sources confirming CDC classified 2025-26 as "moderately severe" (first time this designation used). As of early January: 11M illnesses, **120,000 hospitalizations**, 5,000 deaths. H3N2 subclade K dominant. High quality (CDC-sourced data).

7. **CDC FluView Week 6 (2026)**: Official surveillance report. Influenza A(H3N2) still dominant nationally, Influenza B increasing. Activity increased in some regions, decreased in others. Suggests season may be past peak or transitioning. High quality.

8. **Becker's Hospital Review (Oct 10, 2025)**: Pre-season CDC projection. CDC projected "moderate" season, similar to 2024-25. 2024-25 had 610,000 hospitalizations (preliminary). This is a key reference point. Moderate quality (secondary source of CDC projections).

9. **Taiwan CDC articles (Feb 22-23, 2026)**: Multiple articles about Taiwan's flu situation. **Not relevant** to U.S. CDC burden estimates. Low relevance.

10. **WHO Next-Gen Vaccines (Feb 21, 2026)**: Background on influenza vaccine development. Not directly relevant to resolution. Low relevance.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**

- **CDC historical range of 120,000–710,000 hospitalizations (final estimates, 2010-2025)**: This is the most critical piece of evidence. The upper bound of the historical range for *final* estimates is 710,000. The resolution criterion requires the *preliminary upper bound* to reach 850,000. Preliminary upper bounds are typically higher than final estimates (due to wide confidence intervals early in season), but this historical range suggests the baseline expectation is well below 850,000. The 2024-25 season (high severity, 610,000 hospitalizations per Becker's) apparently had a final estimate within this range.

- **As of early January 2026, cumulative hospitalizations estimated at ~120,000 lower bound**: The season was classified as "moderately severe" at this point. This is a relatively low starting point for reaching 850,000 upper bound by April 5.

- **Week 6 (2026) surveillance showing mixed signals**: Some regions declining, Influenza B increasing. This suggests the season may be transitioning past its H3N2 peak, which is consistent with a season that won't reach extreme severity.

**Moderate evidence:**

- **2025-26 classified as "moderately severe" by CDC**: This designation (first time used) suggests the season is above average but not extreme. Moderate seasons historically don't reach 850,000 upper bounds.

- **H3N2 subclade K dominance**: H3N2 seasons tend to be more severe, especially for elderly. This could push the season toward higher hospitalization totals. However, the season was still classified as "moderate."

- **Vaccination rates slightly higher than last season**: Could moderate severity relative to 2024-25.

- **Becker's citing 2024-25 as having 610,000 hospitalizations**: If 2025-26 is "moderately severe" and comparable to 2024-25, the final estimate might be in the 400,000-700,000 range. The preliminary upper bound would need to be ~850,000+.

**Weak evidence:**

- **NBC News reporting hospitalizations nearly doubled in one week (Dec 20, 2025)**: Suggests rapid early escalation, but this was early in the season and the season was still not at peak.

- **Taiwan CDC data**: Irrelevant to U.S. estimates.

**Key calculation:**

The resolution criterion requires the **upper bound** of the preliminary estimate to reach 850,000. Based on CDC methodology, the upper bound is typically 1.5-3x the lower bound (due to wide confidence intervals). 

- As of early January 2026: lower bound ~120,000, upper bound likely ~200,000-360,000
- Season peak likely occurred in late January/early February 2026
- As of mid-February 2026 (per outside view): lower bound ~300,000
- By April 5, 2026: lower bound might reach ~400,000-500,000 (adding ~100,000-200,000 more as season winds down)
- Upper bound at 2x ratio: ~800,000-1,000,000

The 2024-25 season (610,000 final hospitalizations) was described as "one of the most severe since 2010-11." If 2025-26 is "moderately severe" and comparable, the final lower bound might be 400,000-600,000, with upper bound 600,000-1,200,000.

The critical uncertainty is the ratio of upper to lower bound in preliminary estimates. If the ratio is ~2:1, and the lower bound reaches ~425,000, the upper bound would reach 850,000.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Resolution date**: April 5, 2026 (~6 weeks from today, February 23, 2026)
- **Current status**: Season appears to be past or near peak (Week 6 data shows mixed signals, Influenza B increasing as H3N2 declines)
- **Remaining accumulation**: Flu seasons typically wind down from February through March. With ~6 weeks remaining, and declining weekly hospitalizations, the lower bound might add 100,000-200,000 more.

**If timeframe halved (to ~3 weeks)**: The lower bound would accumulate less (~50,000-100,000 more), making it harder to reach the threshold. Probability would drop to ~20-25%.

**If timeframe doubled (to ~12 weeks)**: More accumulation possible, but flu seasons typically end by May. Probability would increase to ~50-55%.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting from 38% outside view base rate:**

**Factors pushing DOWN:**
1. CDC's own historical range (120K-710K for final estimates) suggests the typical upper bound of *final* estimates doesn't reach 850K. Even if preliminary upper bounds are higher, the season would need to be exceptional. (-5%)
2. Season classified as "moderately severe" - not extreme. Historical extreme seasons (2017-18) had preliminary upper bounds well above 850K. Moderate seasons don't typically reach this threshold. (-5%)
3. Week 6 data suggests season may be past peak or transitioning, limiting remaining accumulation. (-3%)
4. Higher vaccination rates than last season could moderate final burden. (-2%)

**Factors pushing UP:**
1. H3N2 subclade K dominance is historically associated with more severe seasons, especially for elderly. (+3%)
2. The resolution criterion only requires the *upper bound* to reach 850K, not the midpoint or lower bound. This is a lower bar. (+5%)
3. The season appears to have had a significant early surge (hospitalizations nearly doubled in one week in December). (+3%)
4. If 2024-25 had 610K final hospitalizations and 2025-26 is comparable, preliminary upper bounds could plausibly reach 850K. (+3%)

**Net adjustment from 38%**: -4% net downward = ~34%

However, I need to reconsider the key data point: As of early January 2026, the CDC estimated only ~120,000 hospitalizations (lower bound). For the upper bound to reach 850,000 by April 5, the lower bound would need to reach ~425,000 (at 2:1 ratio). That requires adding ~305,000 more lower-bound hospitalizations after early January. This is plausible given the season was still accelerating in early January, but it's a large number.

Looking at 2024-25 (610,000 final hospitalizations), if we assume 2025-26 reaches a similar final lower bound of ~500,000-600,000, the preliminary upper bound could be ~750,000-1,200,000. This makes the 850,000 upper bound threshold quite plausible for a season of this severity.

But the CDC classified 2025-26 as "moderately severe" - suggesting it might not reach 2024-25 levels. If the final lower bound is ~350,000-450,000, the upper bound would be ~525,000-900,000. This is right at the threshold.

Given the significant uncertainty and the fact that the upper-bound-only criterion makes this easier to satisfy, I'll settle at approximately **38%** - essentially maintaining the outside view estimate, as the inside view factors roughly cancel out.

---

**Probability Calibration:**

The outside view gives 38%. The inside view analysis reveals:
- The season is "moderately severe" (not extreme), which is a downward pressure
- The upper-bound-only criterion is an upward pressure
- The current trajectory (120K lower bound in early January, season past peak) suggests the final lower bound might be 400K-550K, putting the upper bound at 600K-1.1M
- The threshold of 850K is right in the middle of the plausible range for the upper bound

I'll maintain approximately **37%** as my final estimate, reflecting genuine uncertainty about whether this moderate-to-high severity season will push the preliminary upper bound above 850K.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will CDC's preliminary flu hospitalization estimate for 2025-26 have an upper bound ≥850,000 before April 5, 2026? Yes, this matches my analysis.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 38% (based on ~2/14 historical seasons exceeding this threshold). My final prediction of 37% is rooted to this base rate with minor adjustments.

3. **Consistency check**: "37 out of 100 times, the CDC's preliminary upper bound estimate reaches 850,000 before April 5, 2026." This is plausible given the moderate-to-high severity season and the upper-bound-only criterion.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - CDC historical range tops at 710K for *final* estimates (suggests 850K upper bound is rare) ✓
   - Season classified "moderately severe" with 120K lower bound in early January ✓
   - Upper-bound-only criterion makes threshold easier to reach ✓
   - H3N2 subclade K associated with more severe outcomes ✓
   - Week 6 data suggests season transitioning/past peak ✓

5. **Blind spot**: If the season had a later, larger second wave (Influenza B surge after H3N2 peak), the upper bound could easily exceed 850K. This scenario would make my ~37% look too low. Conversely, if the season peaked earlier than expected and is declining rapidly, 37% might be too high.

6. **Status quo**: The current status quo is a moderately severe season that appears past or near peak. The status quo outcome is that the upper bound reaches somewhere in the 600K-800K range - just below the threshold. This slightly nudges me toward a lower probability.

Probability calibration: Settling at **37%**, reflecting genuine uncertainty about whether this moderate-to-high severity season will push the preliminary upper bound above 850K.

Probability: 37%
