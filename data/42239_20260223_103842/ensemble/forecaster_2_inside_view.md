**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **CDC FluView Week 51 (2025)** – Official CDC surveillance report. High quality. Factual: Flu positivity increasing nationally, H3N2 dominant. No cumulative burden estimates. Dated late December 2025.

2. **CDC Flu Burden page (Nov 21, 2025)** – Official CDC methodology page. High quality. Factual: Historical final-season hospitalizations ranged 120k–710k (2010–2025). No 2025-26 specific numbers yet available.

3. **CDC 2025-26 Preliminary Burden page** – Official primary source for resolution. High quality. Factual: Same historical range cited; no current-season numerical estimates captured in extraction.

4. **CDC FluVaxView (Feb 18, 2026)** – Official vaccination dashboard. High quality. Factual: ~134.8M doses distributed; adult coverage 46.2% (slightly higher than last year). No hospitalization burden data.

5. **NBC News (Dec 30, 2025)** – Journalistic report citing CDC data. Medium quality. Factual: As of week ending Dec 20, 2025: ~7.5M illnesses, hospitalizations nearly doubled week-over-week to 19,053 weekly. Expert opinion (Kuritzkes, Goebel, Yealy): season not near peak, expected to peak late January/February.

7. **AskNews articles (Taiwan CDC)** – Taiwan CDC data, not US CDC. Low relevance to US resolution criteria. Factual for Taiwan context only.

8. **KSL/Reuters/multiple outlets (Jan 5-6, 2026)** – Multiple independent sources citing CDC classification. Medium-high quality. Factual: CDC classified 2025-26 as "moderately severe" (first time); as of early January: ~11M illnesses, **120,000 hospitalizations**, 5,000 deaths. H3N2 subclade K dominant. Weekly hospital admissions ~33,301 in week ending Dec 27.

9. **Becker's Hospital Review (Oct 10, 2025)** – Pre-season CDC projection. Medium quality. Factual: CDC projected "moderate" season; 2024-25 had 610,000 final hospitalizations (highest since 2010).

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Multiple sources confirm**: As of early January 2026, cumulative hospitalizations were ~120,000. The season was classified "moderately severe" – the first time CDC used this designation. This is well below 850,000 with ~3 months of season remaining.
- **Historical range**: CDC's own data shows final-season hospitalizations 2010-2025 ranged 120k–710k. The upper bound of the *preliminary model* (which is wider than final estimates) has only exceeded 850k in 2017-18 (a very high severity season). The 2024-25 season (highest hospitalization rate on record) had a final estimate of ~610k.
- **Season trajectory**: By early January 2026, ~120k cumulative hospitalizations with the season classified as "moderately severe." To reach 850k upper bound, the season would need to be extraordinarily severe – well beyond the 2024-25 record final total.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **H3N2 subclade K**: This variant was linked to severe early seasons in UK/Japan. However, WHO noted no evidence of increased severity. The season is tracking as "moderately severe," not "high severity."
- **Early season surge**: The season started earlier and more intensely than 2024-25 at the same time point. However, early surges don't necessarily translate to record-breaking totals.
- **Flu B increasing (Week 6)**: A secondary wave of Influenza B could extend the season and add hospitalizations. This is a modest upward factor.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Vaccination rates slightly higher than last year** (46.2% vs 44.3% adults): This slightly suppresses hospitalization burden.
- **Taiwan CDC data**: Not relevant to US resolution.

**Key quantitative anchor**: 120,000 hospitalizations as of early January 2026. Even in the worst season (2017-18), the preliminary upper bound reaching 850k required the season to be classified as "high severity" with a final estimate around 800k+. The current "moderately severe" classification with 120k by early January suggests a final total well below 850k. The preliminary model's upper bound is typically ~1.5-2x the central estimate, so even if the final central estimate reaches 500k (which would be extraordinary for a "moderate" season), the upper bound might reach 750k-1M. But this scenario seems unlikely given current trajectory.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Today**: Feb 23, 2026. Resolution: Apr 5, 2026. **~41 days remaining.**
- The flu season typically peaks in January-February and declines through March. By late February, most of the hospitalization burden has already accumulated.
- If the timeframe were **halved** (~20 days): Even less likely, as the season would need to surge dramatically in a very short window.
- If the timeframe were **doubled** (~82 days, through May): Slightly more likely as the full season burden would be captured, but flu seasons rarely extend significantly past April.
- **Current status quo**: If the season continues on its "moderately severe" trajectory, the final total will likely be in the 400k-700k range (central estimate), with the preliminary upper bound possibly reaching 600k-900k. The 850k threshold is at the very upper edge of plausibility.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view baseline is ~11%. Now considering inside view factors:

**Upward adjustments:**
- The season started earlier and more intensely than average, with H3N2 subclade K driving severity (+2%)
- Influenza B wave emerging in Week 6 could extend the season and add to cumulative burden (+1%)
- The preliminary model's upper bounds are typically quite wide (potentially 1.5-2x central estimate)

**Downward adjustments:**
- CDC classified season as "moderately severe" not "high severity" – the 850k threshold has only been approached in truly high-severity seasons (-3%)
- As of early January, only 120k hospitalizations – the trajectory would need to be extraordinary to reach 850k upper bound (-2%)
- 2024-25 (highest hospitalization rate on record) had a FINAL estimate of only 610k; the preliminary upper bound for that season likely didn't reach 850k (-2%)
- Vaccination rates slightly higher than last year (-1%)
- Season appears to be past peak or near peak as of late February (-1%)

**Net adjustment**: -6% from base rate of 11% → ~5%

However, I need to be careful: the resolution criterion is specifically the **upper bound** of the preliminary estimate range, which is wider than final estimates. If the season's central estimate reaches ~500-600k, the upper bound could potentially reach 750k-900k. This creates some residual probability. But given the "moderately severe" classification and 120k by early January, even this scenario seems unlikely.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view is 11%. The inside view evidence, particularly the "moderately severe" classification, the 120k hospitalization count as of early January, and the historical record showing only 2017-18 (a true high-severity season) clearly exceeded this threshold, pushes the probability down. The emerging Influenza B wave and wide preliminary model bounds provide some upside risk. I settle on approximately **8%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will CDC's 2025-26 preliminary flu hospitalization estimate's upper bound reach ≥850,000 before April 5, 2026? Resolution based on CDC's specific burden page.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 11% (1-2 out of 15 seasons historically exceeded this threshold in preliminary estimates).

3. **Consistency check**: "8 out of 100 times, the CDC preliminary upper bound reaches 850k before April 5, 2026." This aligns with a season classified as moderately severe with 120k hospitalizations by early January.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - CDC classified season "moderately severe" (not high severity) – historically only high-severity seasons approach 850k
   - ~120k cumulative hospitalizations as of early January 2026 – well below threshold trajectory
   - 2024-25 (record season) had final estimate of ~610k – 850k upper bound would require exceeding this
   - H3N2 subclade K + emerging Flu B wave could extend/worsen season
   - Season likely at or past peak by late February

5. **Blind spot**: If the preliminary model's upper bound is unusually wide this season (e.g., due to data uncertainty), or if a late Influenza B surge dramatically extends the season, the upper bound could cross 850k even with a moderate central estimate. This could push probability to ~15-20%.

6. **Status quo**: The season is winding down from its peak. The status quo is that cumulative hospitalizations continue to accumulate but at a decelerating rate, ending well below 850k upper bound.

Probability: 8%
