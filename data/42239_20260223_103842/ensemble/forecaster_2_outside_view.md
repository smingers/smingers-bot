Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **CDC Flu Burden 2025-26 page (Nov 21, 2025)**: Official CDC source. States historical range of end-of-season hospitalizations (2010-2025) is 120,000-710,000. No specific 2025-26 estimates captured in text extraction. High quality but limited data.

2. **CDC Flu Burden 2024-25 page (May 9, 2025)**: Official CDC source. States historical range (2010-2024) is 120,000-710,000. Confirms the 2024-25 final estimate was not yet incorporated or remained within this range. High quality.

3. **CDC MMWR (Sep 11, 2025)**: Peer-reviewed surveillance report. Documents 2024-25 as highest severity since 2010-11, with hospitalization rate of 127.1/100,000. Highly credible.

4. **CNN article (Jan 9, 2026)**: News report citing CDC data. States cumulative season estimates as of early January 2026: ~15 million illnesses, ~180,000 hospitalizations, ~7,400 deaths. Season not yet peaked. Reasonable quality; cites CDC directly.

5. **Agent Report**: Synthesizes multiple CDC sources. Key finding: 2017-18 had preliminary upper bound of ~1,357,043; 2024-25 likely exceeded 800K preliminary upper bound. As of mid-February 2026, lower bound estimate ~300,000. The agent notes the 2025-26 season appears "moderate-to-high severity." Useful synthesis but some claims are inferred rather than directly documented.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes apply:

- **All flu seasons 2010-2025**: Historical upper bound of end-of-season estimates is 710,000, below the 850,000 threshold. Only 2017-18 had a preliminary in-season upper bound exceeding 800,000 (reaching ~1.36M). That's 1 out of ~14 seasons (~7%).

- **High-severity seasons only (2017-18, 2024-25)**: Both likely had preliminary upper bounds exceeding 800,000. 2024-25 was the most severe since 2017-18. The 2025-26 season appears moderate-to-high, not classified as "high severity for all ages" like 2024-25.

- **Seasons where preliminary upper bound exceeded 850,000**: Only 2017-18 definitively confirmed. Possibly 2024-25. That's 1-2 out of ~14 seasons (~7-14%).

The most suitable reference class is: **seasons where the preliminary in-season upper bound of hospitalization estimates reaches 850,000 before April 5** = roughly 1-2 out of 14 seasons, or ~7-14%.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- The question resolves April 5, 2026 — approximately 6 weeks from today (Feb 23, 2026).
- As of early January 2026, cumulative hospitalizations were ~180,000 (lower bound). By mid-February 2026, the lower bound was ~300,000.
- The season was not yet peaked as of January 9, 2026. By late February, the season may be near or past peak.
- Weekly hospitalizations were ~40,000/week in early January. If the season peaked around late January/early February 2026 and is now declining, remaining weeks will add fewer hospitalizations.
- For the upper bound to reach 850,000, given the lower bound is ~300,000 in mid-February, the upper bound would need to be roughly 450,000-600,000+ currently (CDC ranges typically have upper bounds ~1.5-2x the lower bound). 
- If the upper bound is currently ~450,000-600,000, it would need to grow by another ~250,000-400,000 in the remaining 6 weeks. This seems unlikely unless the season is unusually prolonged and severe.

**(d) Justification**

Key factors:
1. Historical base rate: Only ~1-2 of 14 seasons had preliminary upper bounds exceeding 850,000 (the threshold), suggesting ~7-14% base rate.
2. The 2025-26 season appears moderate-to-high severity, not the extreme severity of 2017-18 or 2024-25.
3. As of mid-February 2026, lower bound ~300,000 → upper bound likely ~450,000-600,000. To reach 850,000 upper bound requires substantial additional accumulation in 6 weeks.
4. The season may be past peak or near peak, limiting remaining accumulation.
5. The CDC's historical range (2010-2025) is 120,000-710,000 for final estimates, suggesting even final upper bounds rarely approach 850,000.
6. The resolution criterion uses the **upper bound** of the range, which is more generous than the point estimate. This slightly increases probability vs. using the midpoint.
7. The 2024-25 season (most severe in 14 years) likely had preliminary upper bounds exceeding 850,000 during its peak, suggesting it's achievable in very severe seasons.

The 2025-26 season, while active and moderately severe, does not appear to be tracking toward 2017-18 or 2024-25 severity levels. The current trajectory suggests the upper bound will likely peak well below 850,000.

Outside view calibration:

- Base rate from reference class: ~7-14% (1-2 seasons out of 14 had upper bounds this high)
- Current season severity: moderate-to-high (not extreme), suggesting below the threshold for achieving 850K upper bound
- Current trajectory: lower bound ~300K in mid-February, upper bound likely ~450-600K, needing ~250-400K more to reach threshold
- Season likely near or past peak, limiting remaining accumulation
- The upper bound criterion is more generous than point estimate, slightly boosting probability
- Adjusting downward from base rate given moderate (not high) severity classification and current trajectory

I estimate approximately 12-18% probability. The upper bound criterion adds some probability vs. using point estimates, but the season trajectory doesn't support reaching 850K.
