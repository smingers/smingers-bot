Analysis:
1) Paraphrase (aligning to resolution criteria)
Will the CDC’s “Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden 2025–2026 Flu Season” page post (between Feb 23 and Apr 4, 2026) any cumulative hospitalization *range* whose **upper bound ≥ 850,000**?

(a) Source analysis (what each source says + quality/date)
- CDC Flu Burden 2025–26 data-vis page (Nov 21, 2025): Primary resolver page/method description; notes historical end-of-season hospitalization estimates (2010–2025) range 120k–710k. High-quality (CDC), but the extraction doesn’t include current-season numeric ranges. Date is early-season.
- CDC Flu Burden general index (Nov 21, 2025): Explains modeling rationale; no 2025–26 numbers. High-quality but not directly decision-relevant.
- CDC FluView week 51 (2025) + week 06 (2026): Surveillance indicators (positivity, strain mix, ILI), not the burden model outputs. High-quality, but indirect for this exact threshold question.
- CDC FluVaxView dashboard (Feb 18, 2026): Vaccination uptake (adults slightly higher than last season; kids similar). High-quality, indirect; relevant as a mitigating factor for severity/hospitalizations.
- NBC News (Dec 30, 2025): Reports a sharp rise and strain details; includes expert quotes about not yet peaking at that time. Medium quality (journalism summarizing clinicians/CDC-like stats), earlier than the forecast window.
- Reuters-syndicated coverage / KSL / Investing.com / MarketScreener (Jan 5–6, 2026): States CDC labeled season “moderately severe” and estimated ~120k hospitalizations as of early Jan. Medium-high quality given it’s attributed to CDC; still earlier than the window and not the specific burden-page range behavior.
- Becker’s Hospital Review (Oct 10, 2025): Pre-season expectations (“moderate”) and historical note that CDC hasn’t recorded two consecutive high-severity seasons in 20+ years. Medium quality; partly interpretive and pre-season.
- AskNews Taiwan CDC articles (Feb 22–23, 2026): About Taiwan’s norovirus/flu B trends; not U.S. CDC flu-burden estimates. Low relevance to U.S. hospitalization threshold; treat as noise here.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to the resolution criterion: upper bound ≥ 850k during Feb 23–Apr 4)
Strong evidence (large directional pull)
- Historical end-of-season U.S. hospitalization estimates (2010–2025) max out around **710k** per CDC background. Threshold **850k** is materially above the historic final-estimate ceiling. This strongly suggests “Yes” requires either an exceptional season or unusually wide in-season uncertainty bands.
- Timing/structure: we are already at **Feb 23** with ~6 weeks left; preliminary uncertainty bands typically narrow later in season, making a very high *upper bound* less likely unless the underlying point estimate is itself extremely high.

Moderate evidence (moderate pull)
- CDC characterization of 2025–26 as “moderately severe” (Jan 5, 2026 reporting of CDC): pushes away from a once-in-a-decade type season needed to plausibly generate ≥850k upper bound late in-season.
- Vaccination coverage is **similar or slightly higher** than last season (FluVaxView Feb 18): modestly reduces tail risk of extreme hospitalization burden.
- Surveillance showed broad increases earlier (week 51), H3N2 predominance and later B increases (week 06): supports “not mild,” but doesn’t specifically imply extreme cumulative hospitalizations.

Weak evidence (small adjustments)
- Media/clinician impressions of hospital strain (NBC Dec 30) and general “surge” framing: informative for direction but not quantitative and far from the exact CDC burden upper-bound criterion.
- Taiwan CDC reports: not decision-relevant to U.S. CDC burden modeling.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window length: **41 days** (Feb 23 → Apr 5, 2026; with postings through Apr 4 counting).
- If the remaining window were halved (~20 days): probability would drop further because there would be fewer weekly updates and less cumulative accrual/lag correction.
- If the window were doubled (hypothetically): probability would rise somewhat because late reporting and model revisions could push cumulative estimates up—but the actual question endpoint is fixed at Apr 5, limiting that effect.

(d) Justification (inside-view update from the outside-view base rate)
Outside view base rate given: **15%** (based on how rarely preliminary upper bounds reach such high levels historically, likely only in the most extreme seasons).

Key inside-view adjustments:
- Downward: The season being labeled **“moderately severe”** is inconsistent with the kind of extreme hospitalization burden usually needed for an **upper bound ≥ 850k**, especially this late in season when uncertainty ranges tend to compress. (Moderate downward shift.)
- Downward: CDC’s own historical context (final estimates historically ≤710k) makes ≥850k a “tail-of-tail” event unless preliminary bands remain unusually wide. Late-season wide bands are less typical. (Moderate downward shift.)
- Slight upward: H3N2 (subclade K) and evidence of substantial early-season surge suggests the season is not mild; if there were a prolonged second wave (e.g., influenza B) plus reporting lags, cumulative could rise more than expected. But this seems more like a path to a high-but-not-extreme season than to crossing 850k. (Small upward shift.)

Net: modestly *lower* than 15% because the strongest available signal (“moderately severe” + late timing) points away from crossing such a high threshold during the remaining window.

Probability calibration
- Status quo continuation: if current trend is a typical post-peak decline with narrowing uncertainty bands, the burden-page upper bound likely peaks below 850k.
- Main “Yes” path: a surprisingly large late-season upward revision (reporting lag/test-adjustment) plus sustained hospitalizations that keep the modeled cumulative point estimate very high, leaving the upper bound ≥850k on at least one weekly update before Apr 5.
- I land at **11%**: still non-trivial because the criterion uses the **upper bound** (not midpoint) and revisions can jump, but low because 850k is above the historic final-estimate ceiling and we’re late in the season.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Yes if CDC burden-page cumulative hospitalization *range* upper bound hits ≥850k on any posting Feb 23–Apr 4, 2026.
2. Outside view base rate: 15%.
3. Consistency check: “11 out of 100 times, CDC posts an upper bound ≥850k before Apr 5.” Plausible as a tail event.
4. Top evidence (3–5):
   - CDC historical end-of-season hospitalization estimates (2010–2025) top out ~710k (threshold is 850k).
   - Only ~6 weeks left; late-season ranges likely narrower, making 850k harder absent extreme underlying burden.
   - CDC/Reuters reporting: 2025–26 labeled “moderately severe,” not extreme.
   - Vaccination coverage similar/slightly higher than last season (mitigating).
5. Blind spot: A major late-season upward revision in CDC’s in-season model (e.g., testing-practice adjustment or backlog) could spike the *upper bound* above 850k even if the season isn’t historically unprecedented. Would push probability upward (maybe into ~20% range).
6. Status quo outcome: No (upper bound remains <850k) seems the default absent surprising revisions.

Probability: 11%
