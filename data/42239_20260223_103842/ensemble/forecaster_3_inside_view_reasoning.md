**Evaluating CDC estimates**

I need to write an analysis for forecasting whether the CDC's preliminary estimates will reach an upper bound of 850k before April 5, 2026. I have to remember that only estimates after February 23 count. Since I'm focusing on the window starting then, I should also note that if the threshold was reached earlier, it doesn’t count. 

I'm gathering information since we don’t have current burden numbers, but I know that historically, the CDC mentions final estimates ranging from 120k to 710k.**Assessing hospitalization estimates**

I'm analyzing hospitalization estimates for the upcoming season. In 2024-25, there were about 610k hospitalizations, and the upper bound may have approached 850k. However, for a more moderate season, I'm estimating final numbers around 300-500k, with a preliminary upper bound of 600-700k.

With only six weeks left, hitting 850k would require high hospitalizations or significant uncertainty in the model. As we near the end of the season, uncertainty should narrow, making it less likely we’ll reach that upper bound. I'll adjust the probability from 15% to around 10-12%.**Evaluating hospitalization designations**

The "moderately severe" label might not directly align with what we consider mild. For 2024-25, the final estimate was around 610k, while a moderate season could see 400-500k, with an upper bound of 650-750k, but not reaching 850k. I'll set my internal estimate at 10%, but I need to analyze sources like CDC FluView and other media for quality evidence.

The timeframe is crucial; with 41 days left, and if it were halved, the probability shrinks even more. However, it can't extend beyond April 5 for this analysis.**Justifying estimation adjustments**

I'm looking at justifications for adjusting the 15% outside base rate downward. The reasons include the season being labeled as moderate, the high threshold exceeding historical final estimates, narrowing intervals as we approach late season, and no signs of extreme severity like in 2017-18. Plus, there's slightly higher vaccine uptake this year.

However, factors like the H3N2 subclade K mismatch and potential early surges might make things worse. I need to ensure my response meets the criterion for an upper bound of 850k between February 23 and April 4 for the 2025-26 burden page.
