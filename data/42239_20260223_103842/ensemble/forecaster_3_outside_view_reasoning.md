**Evaluating season projections**

I need to rely on an outside view for the February 23, 2026, opening date. I'm considering historical data from 2010-2025, especially focusing on seasons with upper bounds reaching 850k or more. So far, 2017-18 is confirmed as having an upper bound over 800k, and it seems likely that 2024-25 might too, although that's uncertain. The threshold I'll consider is 850k, applying a general historical rate for the 2025-26 season without inside data.**Analyzing upper bounds**

Looking back at the historical data, it seems the 2009-10 season isn't part of the 2010-2025 analysis. The final maximum for those years suggests around 710k, but preliminary readings might exceed 850k in a few seasons. The agent report indicates that 2017-18 had an upper bound of 1.357M, and there's a chance 2024-25 could also beat 800k. With a base rate of 1 to 2 in 8 seasons, I'm estimating around 14-28% for reaching 850k but with uncertainty involved. The 850k threshold is higher than historical maxes, yet early in the season, those upper bounds could rise!**Assessing CDC estimates**

I’m recognizing that the CDC uses credible intervals, which can be quite broad when uncertainty is high. This might allow for upper bounds to exceed 850k, especially in moderately high seasons, like in 2017-18. However, I’m noticing a wide range from 620k to 1.357M, suggesting a substantial factor above the 808k point estimate. For an estimated upper of 850k, I'd need around a 530k point estimate. Many seasons hover around 490k, with upper limits possibly near 800k, but reports claim only 2017-18 and 2024-25 exceeded 800k. I should analyze sources like the CDC, MMWR, and CNN for a better outside view, aiming for a base rate of about 12.8%.**Estimating flu season probabilities**

I'm determining a reference class based on U.S. flu seasons from 2010, using CDC preliminary burden ranges. Specifically, I'm interested in seasons that have an upper bound of 850k or higher before early April. Counting from 2010-11 to 2024-25, that gives me 15 seasons (excluding 2020-21, though data might be incomplete). If only 2017-18 crosses that threshold, the probability is 7.1%. If 2024-25 also crosses, it could be up to 14.3%. Considering uncertainty, I estimate a final outside view prediction of about 11.3%.
