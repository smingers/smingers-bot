Analysis:
1. Paraphrase of title & criterion (≤30 words) – Question resolves “Yes” if, any time before 5 Apr 2026, the CDC Preliminary 2025-26 Burden page shows a cumulative-hospitalisation range whose UPPER bound ≥ 850 000.

------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (ordered by relevance)

1) CDC “Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden 2025-26” page (official, updated weekly). Factual, high-quality. Only methodology captured in extraction; numeric range on 23 Feb 2026 must be checked live (not provided).  
2) Reuters/Investing.com 5 Jan 2026 wire (CDC press-briefing). Factual counts: 11 M illnesses, 120 000 modelled hospitalisations, 5 000 deaths to end-Dec; labelled season “moderately severe.” High reliability; numbers are CDC’s own.  
3) NBC News 30 Dec 2025 article. Factual CDC counts (≈19 k admissions that week) + physicians’ opinions that the peak still ahead. Medium quality; near-real-time.  
4) CDC FluView Week 6 (early Feb 2026) & Week 51 (Dec 2025) surveillance reports. Lab and ILI data only; no burden estimates—weak relevance.  
5) Historic CDC burden pages 2010-25 cited in extraction. Show FINAL seasons range 120 k–710 k hospitalisations. High-quality, structural evidence.  
6) AskNews Taiwan norovirus articles, Sudan WHO report, WHO vaccine assessment. Different geographies / topics—no bearing on US hospitalisation burden. Discard for forecast.

(b) Evidence weighing

Strong evidence  
• Historic final-season hospitalisations never exceeded 710 k (2010-25). Structural, CDC-verified.  
• Present season labelled only “moderately severe” with 120 k hospitalisations by 27 Dec (Reuters).  

Moderate evidence  
• 2017-18 preliminary upper bound reportedly > 1 M, so upper bounds can overshoot true total by ~60 %. Shows criterion can be met without reaching 850 k true cases.  
• Weekly admissions peaked at 33 k late-Dec and declined through Jan/Feb (FluView trends typical). Momentum suggests tapering. About six weeks remain.

Weak evidence  
• Expert comments (NBC) in late Dec that peak “weeks away.” Already historical and proved: activity peaked mid-Jan and is now receding.  
• Absence of January/February numeric burden range on extracted page (informational gap).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days remaining: 41. Hospitalisations accrue but growth rate now falling. Halving window to 20 days would cut probability roughly in half; doubling (to 82 days) would raise it modestly (+2–3 pp) because late-season accumulation is usually limited.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base rate (section above) = 11 %.  
Current season facts shift probability downward:

1. Point estimate as of late Dec only 120 k. Even if hospitalisations doubled since, point ≈ 240 k. CDC preliminary intervals have historically been 1.5–2.0× the point. An optimistic upper-bound multiplier of 2.5 still yields ≈ 600 k < 850 k. (Strong).  
2. “Moderately severe” classification – historically associated with final totals 280 k–500 k. Seasons classified “high” or “very high” (e.g., 2017-18) are the ones whose upper bounds breached 850 k. (Strong).  
3. Peak of hospitalisations has already passed (Week 2-3) with weekly FluSurv-NET rates now falling. Little runway left for huge upward revisions. (Moderate).  
4. Only one confirmed season in 15 crossed the threshold; nothing in current virological or healthcare data suggests 2025-26 is comparably extreme. (Strong).

Combining: multiply base-rate 11 % by ~0.45 (aggregate downward pressure) ⇒ ≈ 5 %. Small residual probability reflects model-revision risk and the possibility that current numeric range (not yet seen) is unexpectedly wide.

Probability calibration
I expect that in 5 out of 100 comparable seasons, the CDC page would ever display an upper-bound ≥ 850 000 between now and 5 Apr 2026.

Checklist:
1. Criteria restated (see top) – ok.  
2. Base rate 11 % used – yes.  
3. Consistency line above – yes.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • 120 k hospitalisations by 27 Dec, CDC.  
   • Historic final-season max 710 k (2010-25).  
   • “Moderately severe” label not “high.”  
   • Peak admissions already passed; weekly totals falling.  
   • Only 2017-18 known to cross 850 k upper bound.  
5. Blind-spot: Testing under-ascertainment far worse than assumed, causing model to widen interval > 3× point in March. Would raise odds >20 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome = “No”; time short, trend downward—slight nudge to “No” incorporated.

Probability: 5%
