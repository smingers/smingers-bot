**Estimating flu hospitalizations**

I need to estimate flu hospitalizations based on some key figures. In the 2017-18 season, we saw about 808k final cases, with an upper estimate of 1.3 million. We had around 17 million reported illnesses and 290k hospitalizations by the end of January. Flu hospitalizations tend to peak between December and February. I suspect by early January, we saw around 120k, with weekly admissions peaking at 33k. By February 23, the cumulative admissions could be between 200k and 250k, which is still below the 850k mark.**Adjusting hospitalization estimates**

I’m considering that the upper bound for estimated hospitalizations could be around 400k, significantly less than 850k. Therefore, the likelihood of reaching that higher number seems small. Unless there’s considerable underreporting, it’s uncommon for figures to exceed double the point estimate. I’m thinking to adjust my estimate, factoring in a severity classification of 'moderately severe' and a moderate baseline. Given the low current hospitalizations, a downward adjustment by about half seems reasonable, resulting in a revised estimate of around 5-6%. I’ll compile a full analysis with all components and evidence.
