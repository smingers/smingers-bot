Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. CDC “Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden 2025-2026” page (21 Nov 2025). Primary, high-quality; gives methods and historic context, no current numbers. Factual only.  
2. CDC FluView Week 06 report (posted 14 Feb 2026). Primary surveillance; shows viral and hospitalization *rates*, not the burden range used for resolution. Factual.  
3. Reuters / KSL / Investing.com stories (5-6 Jan 2026) quoting CDC press call: “11 M illnesses, 120 k hospitalisations”. Secondary but sourced directly to CDC. Dates recent enough to gauge magnitude. Mostly factual; expert commentary (CDC epidemiologists) carries weight.  
4. NBC News piece (30 Dec 2025). Secondary, cites CDC weekly admissions (~19 k) and several ID physicians. Factual numbers plus expert opinions on trajectory.  
5. Taiwan-CDC articles (23 Feb 2026) plus WHO & Sudan pieces. Not U.S. flu burden, irrelevant to resolution. Ignored.  

Quality summary: only items 1-4 materially inform the forecast; all are ≤8 weeks old and sourced from CDC or credentialed experts.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historic record 2010-2025: only 1–2 seasons ever reached an 850 k upper-bound; none did so *after* late February.  
• Current cumulative hospitalisations reported by CDC (point ≈120 k in early Jan; plausible 180-250 k by now) are <⅓ of past seasons that ultimately exceeded 700 k.  
Moderate evidence  
• Season classified by CDC as “moderately severe”, not “very high”.  
• Typical late-season growth rate: ≤40 k admissions/week and slowing after February.  
Weak evidence  
• Speculation about a coming influenza-B wave. No quantified U.S. hospitalisation forecast attached.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until cut-off: 41.  If the window were halved (≈3 weeks) my probability would fall by ~⅓ because less time remains for a surprise surge.  If doubled (≈11 weeks) I would add ~1 ppt but still stay in single digits; most accumulation happens before April anyway.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base (Laplace-corrected late-Feb frequency) = 7 %.  
Down-adjustments  
– Season size to date far below historic 850 k seasons (-3 ppt).  
– Model intervals narrow this late; need >2× jump in both point estimate *and* upper bound (-2 ppt).  
Up-adjustments  
+ Revision/measurement noise tail risk (+1 ppt).  
Net inside view ≈3 %.

Status-quo continuation (no extraordinary March wave) keeps upper bound <450 k, yielding a “No”. Only an unprecedented March-April hospitalization surge or a major methodological recalibration could push the range over 850 k.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 3 out of 100 comparable seasons would see the upper-bound estimate touch ≥850 k after today.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Between now and 4 Apr 2026 will the CDC burden page ever show an upper-bound ≥ 850 k hospitalisations for 2025-26?  
2. Base rate used: 7 %.  
3. Consistency line: “3 out of 100 times, the 850 k threshold is reached.”  
4. Key evidence (concise):  
   – Current point estimate likely ≤250 k.  
   – Historic late-Feb crossing frequency 0/13 seasons.  
   – CDC labels season only “moderately severe”.  
   – Remaining 6 weeks rarely add >200 k hospitalisations.  
5. Blind spot: Massive late influenza-B wave doubling hospitalisations plus upward model revision; would raise probability toward 15-20 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome = No; short horizon favours it.

Probability: 3%
