**Analyzing influenza B wave impact**

I'm considering an edge scenario where there could be a late-season wave of influenza B. If this wave turns out to be significant, it might lead to an additional 200,000 hospitalizations by April 5, which could push the total to 450,000. That said, the probability of this happening seems low, maybe around 2%. However, with 41 days left to assess the situation, I think I could adjust my estimation to 3% and craft my final answer accordingly.
