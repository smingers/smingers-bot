Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. CDC Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden 2025-26 page (Nov 21 2025).  
   • Factual: methodology and statement that historical end-of-season hospitalisations (2010-25) ranged 120 k–710 k.  
   • No quantitative 2025-26 figures shown in the scrape; quality high but information thin and two months old.  
2. CDC Preliminary pages for 2024-25, 2023-24 etc.  
   • Consistently give the same historical 120 k–710 k range; high-quality primary data, but again no 2025-26 numbers.  
3. CDC MMWR 74(34) (Sep 11 2025) on the completed 2024-25 season.  
   • Factual: 2024-25 was a high-severity season with the highest FluSurv-NET hospitalisation rate since 2010-11.  
   • Opinion: calls for vaccination—policy not relevant to the numeric threshold.  
   • High source quality, peer-reviewed, nine months old.  
4. CNN article (Jan 9 2026) quoting CDC weekly situation update.  
   • Factual: cumulative preliminary estimate “at least 180 000 hospitalisations” as of early January.  
   • Opinion: season “probably has not peaked”.  
   • Timely, but a secondary source; useful for cross-checking order of magnitude.  
5. Agent report (Feb 2026) that collated archived CDC pages.  
   • Factual elements: 2017-18 preliminary upper bound 1.36 M, only confirmed season to exceed 850 k; 2024-25 very likely but not documented; provides a table of seasons 2010-25.  
   • This is a tertiary synthesis—helpful but should be treated with modest confidence until underlying CDC screenshots are verified.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Potential classes:  
i) All U.S. flu seasons 2010-11 through 2024-25 (15 seasons with routinely modelled prelim estimates).  
ii) Sub-set of “high-severity” seasons (2012-13, 2014-15, 2017-18, 2024-25).  
iii) Seasons in which, by the last week of February, the CDC preliminary upper bound was still < 850 k.  

Class (i) is broad and objective, but dilutes the extreme-season signal.  
Class (ii) focuses on seasons capable of producing very high counts, but we lack an agreed cut-off and the sample is small.  
Class (iii) matches the question’s current date—late February—and directly asks “how often did the threshold get crossed after this point?”; this is the most decision-relevant frame. I adopt class (iii).

c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today → resolution cut-off = 41 days (23 Feb 2026 → 4 Apr 2026).  
• Historical pattern: Peak hospitalisation accrual almost always occurs between late December and mid-February. 2017-18 and 2024-25 both peaked in early February and had already blown past their eventual maxima by late February.  
• After early March, cumulative estimates rise but at a rapidly decelerating pace; late-season surges large enough to add > 250 k hospitalisations in just six weeks are unprecedented in the 2010-25 record.

d) Justification  
Historical frequency:  
– Out of 15 seasons (2010-25) only one is firmly documented to have had a preliminary upper bound ≥ 850 k (2017-18). That is 6.7 %.  
– A second season (2024-25) probably met the criterion; if true, frequency becomes 13.3 %. I treat this as a plausible upper bound on the base rate.  
  
Late-February conditional:  
– In both candidate seasons the ≥ 850 k mark had already been reached before week 8.  
– Across the remaining 13 seasons none crossed 850 k later in the season.  
– Therefore, conditional on the threshold not yet being reached by 23 Feb, historical frequency is 0/13 = 0 %.  
Because the sample is small, apply a Laplace correction (add one pseudo-success and one pseudo-failure): (0 + 1)/(13 + 2) ≈ 6.7 %.

Magnitude consideration:  
– Current public-domain figures (e.g., CNN citing CDC) put cumulative hospitalisations in the low-hundreds-of-thousands. Even if weekly admissions stayed at a January-peak-like 40 k, adding six weeks yields only ≈ 250 k extra. Reaching an 850 k upper bound would therefore require a modelling uncertainty interval more than doubling from its present level—historically rare this late in the season.  
  
Upset rate:  
– Influenza seasons occasionally produce surprises (2009-10, 2017-18), but once February data are in hand truly “out-of-left-field” explosions are unusual. I assign a 4 %‐points allowance for tail risk and modelling artefacts.

Outside view calibration:
• Unconditional late-Feb base rate (Laplace-adjusted) ≈ 7 %.  
• Adjust downward because the 2025-26 season to date appears only moderate-to-high, not extreme (–3 %).  
• Add 1 % for model/revision noise and reporting quirks that might pop the upper bound briefly above the line.  
Resulting outside-view probability ≈ 5 %.

Outside View Prediction:
5.2 %
