**Analyzing flu hospitalization predictions**

I need to analyze and predict the probability of CDC’s estimate for flu-related hospitalizations reaching 850,000 for the 2025–26 season before April 5, 2026. This requires looking at historical data, like previous end-of-season upper bounds from 2010–2024, which ranged from 120k to 710k. Preliminary numbers can exceed final tallies, but historically, only 1 or 2 seasons might exceed the 850k threshold, suggesting a base rate of around 6-12%.**Evaluating flu season probabilities**

I’m considering that if only two seasons have reached 850k and both did so before February 23, the probability of hitting that threshold by April 5 is extremely low—maybe between 0-3%. Examining the trend, seasons tend to peak in early February, indicating that once a season hasn’t reached that threshold by late February, it likely won’t. Historical data suggests an upper bound of 400k to 600k as of January 2026, supporting this low probability. I’ll gather relevant sources to back this analysis.**Crafting probability text**

I want to determine a probability and think I should choose around 4%. To be a bit more precise, I might present it as 4.1%. Now, I’ll work on articulating this in a clear and concise way. Let’s make sure I effectively communicate this probability as part of the overall analysis I’m putting together. Time to get creative and structure this in an engaging manner!
