## Summary: CDC Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden 2025–2026 Season (November 21, 2025)

### Key Facts & Statistics

- **Data publication date:** November 21, 2025
- **Season start date for cumulative estimates:** October 1, 2025
- **Historical range of end-of-season flu-related hospitalizations (2010–2025):** 120,000–710,000
- The page provides **weekly, preliminary estimates** of cumulative flu illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths
- Estimates are expressed as **ranges** (lower to upper bound) rather than point values, due to ongoing flu circulation and data limitations early in the season

### Methodology
- CDC uses mathematical models based on **Flu Surv-NET** data, covering approximately **10% of the U.S. population**
- Crude hospitalization rates are adjusted for flu testing frequency and diagnostic test sensitivity, then scaled using ratios of hospitalizations to symptomatic illnesses
- Real-time testing practice data are **not available**; prior season data are used as proxies, which may introduce inaccuracy

### Key Limitations
- Cumulative hospitalization rates may be **underestimated** due to identification and reporting delays
- If current-season testing rates differ from past seasons, estimates may be inaccurate
- Preliminary estimates are **finalized** only when contemporary testing data become available and **may decrease** if testing has increased

### Notable Context for Forecasting
- The article does **not provide specific numerical estimates** for the 2025–26 season as of this publication date (suggesting data may be too limited early in the season to publish figures)
- The historical upper bound of end-of-season hospitalizations across all prior seasons (2010–2025) is **710,000**, which is **below the 850,000 threshold** in the resolution criteria

> **Disclaimer:** The article does not include the actual current-season hospitalization estimate range for 2025–26, only the methodology and historical context. The specific weekly figures may be displayed graphically on the CDC page but were not captured in the extracted text.

### Key Facts & Statistics

**Season Severity:**
- The 2024–25 influenza season was officially classified by CDC as a **high-severity season for all age groups** — the first such designation since 2017–18.
- Co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses characterized the season.

**Hospitalization Rates:**
- Cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate: **127.1 per 100,000 population** (October 1, 2024 – April 30, 2025).
- This rate **surpassed all end-of-season rates since 2010–11**, making it the highest in over a decade.
- Rates were **1.8 to 2.8 times higher** than median historical rates across all age groups (compared to 2010–11 through 2023–24 seasons).
- Highest rates among persons aged **≥75 years (598.8 per 100,000)**.

**Clinical Outcomes Among Hospitalized Patients:**
- **16.8%** admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU)
- **6.1%** received invasive mechanical ventilation
- **3.0%** died in hospital
- **89.1%** had one or more underlying medical conditions

**Vaccination & Treatment:**
- **32.4%** of hospitalized patients had received an influenza vaccine
- **84.8%** received antiviral treatment overall
- Children/adolescents aged **5–17 years had the lowest antiviral treatment rate (61.6%)**

---

### Data Notes
- Data covers approximately **9% of the U.S. population** across ~300 acute care hospitals in 14 states (Flu Surv-NET).
- Preliminary 2024–25 data updated September 2, 2025; **99% complete** for rate and clinical estimation.
- The 2020–21 season was excluded due to insufficient influenza hospitalizations.

---

### Public Health Implications (per CDC)
- Annual influenza vaccination recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months.
- Timely antiviral treatment recommended for all hospitalized influenza patients to reduce complication risk.

---

**Relevance to Forecast Question:** This article documents the *2024–25* season's hospitalization burden (not 2025–26). It establishes a high historical baseline — the highest cumulative hospitalization rate since 2010–11 — which may inform expectations for the upcoming 2025–26 season, but contains **no direct data on 2025–26 season hospitalizations**.

**Source:** CDC Flu Burden page, dated May 9, 2025

---

### Key Methodology Points

- CDC provides **weekly, preliminary estimates** of cumulative flu-related illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths throughout the flu season (typically late fall through early spring).
- Estimates are generated using **mathematical models** based on data from the **Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (Flu Surv-NET)**, which covers approximately **9% of the U.S. population**.
- Results are expressed as a **range** (lower to upper bound) rather than a point estimate, to reflect weekly variability and data limitations.
- The season start date used for cumulative calculations is **October 1, 2024**.

---

### Historical Context (Directly Relevant to the Question)

- **Past end-of-season estimates (2010–2024) of flu-related hospitalizations have ranged from 120,000 to 710,000.**
- This is a notable data point: the historical upper bound of **710,000** is below the **850,000** threshold specified in the forecasting question.

---

### Key Limitations Noted

- Cumulative hospitalization rates may be **underestimated** during the season due to identification and reporting delays.
- Testing practice adjustments rely on **prior season data** as a proxy; if current-season testing has increased, estimates may be **inflated**.
- Preliminary estimates are **finalized** once contemporary testing data become available and may decrease afterward.

## Summary: CDC Says Flu Activity Probably Has Not Peaked Amid Record-Breaking Season (CNN, January 9, 2026)

### Key Statistics & Facts
- **Week ending January 3:** ~40,000 hospitalizations, up ~10% from the prior week's 36,600
- **Hospitalization rate:** ~12 per 100,000 people nationally for that week
- **Cumulative season estimates (as of report):** At least **15 million illnesses, 180,000 hospitalizations, and 7,400 deaths**
- **Pediatric deaths:** At least 17 children have died this season, nearly doubling in one week (8 new deaths reported); 4 deaths in Massachusetts, including 2 infants under age 2 in Boston
- **Vaccine distribution:** ~130 million doses distributed, covering less than 40% of the U.S. population
- **Dominant strain:** Influenza A(H3N2), subclade K variant

### Named Source Opinions
- **CDC:** Flu activity "remains elevated across the country" and is expected to continue for several more weeks; the recent downtick in some indicators "could be due to changes in healthcare seeking or reporting during the holidays," and further increases may follow — the season has likely **not yet peaked**
- **Dr. Bisola Ojikutu (Boston Public Health Commissioner):** Warned of surging flu cases and serious pediatric cases in Boston; urged vaccination for children 6 months and older

### Additional Context
- The prior week's CDC data had shown flu-like activity at the **highest level on record** in ~30 years of tracking
- HHS recently updated the childhood vaccine schedule to require "shared clinical decision-making" for flu vaccines; many state health departments have rejected this, siding with the American Academy of Pediatrics' broader recommendation

**Relevance to forecast:** The cumulative hospitalization estimate stood at approximately **180,000** as of early January 2026, with the season not yet at its peak and weekly hospitalizations running at ~40,000.

# CDC Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden: Hospitalization Upper Bounds (2017–18 through 2024–25)

## Critical New Finding: 2024–25 Season Final Range Statement

The CDC's official **2024–25 Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden page** (cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html, dated May 09, 2025) contains the following key statement:

> *"Past end-of-season estimates of flu-related hospitalizations (2010-2024) have ranged from 120,000–710,000."*

This is a definitive finding: even after the 2024–25 season concluded, the CDC's own 2024–25 burden page still cites the historical range as **120,000–710,000** for seasons 2010–2024. This means the 2024–25 season's final estimate had **not yet been incorporated** into the historical range as of May 2025, OR the 2024–25 final estimate also fell within or below 710,000.

However, the CDC's September 2025 report on 2024–25 influenza activity (cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html) explicitly states: *"Influenza activity in the United States during the 2024–25 season was classified as **high severity**, marking the **most severe influenza season since 2017–18**."* This strongly implies the 2024–25 burden estimate, when finalized, will likely approach or exceed the 2017–18 final estimate of 710,000.

---

## Season-by-Season Summary: Upper Bounds Exceeding 800,000

### 2017–18: Definitively Confirmed
The archived CDC preliminary page for 2017–18 shows:
- **Point estimate**: ~808,129 hospitalizations
- **95% Credible Uncertainty Interval**: 620,768 – **1,357,043**
- The upper bound of **1,357,043** vastly exceeded 800,000

The 2017–18 season was the most severe since 2009–10 H1N1 pandemic. The **final** estimate was revised down to **710,000** (the highest in the 2010–2024 historical range). The preliminary in-season upper bound crossed 800,000 during peak activity, likely in **late January or early February 2018** — the exact weekly date is not available in the retrieved data, but the season peaked in early February 2018.

### 2024–25: High Severity, Upper Bound Almost Certainly Exceeded 800,000
The 2024–25 season was classified as high severity across all ages — the most severe since 2017–18. The CDC's September 2025 summary confirms:
- Peak influenza activity occurred in **early February 2025**
- Highest peak percentage of positive tests in nine seasons (since 2015–16)
- 289 pediatric deaths — highest since 2009–10 H1N1 pandemic
- Hospitalization rates were the highest since 2017–18

Given these indicators, the **preliminary in-season upper bound** for 2024–25 almost certainly exceeded 800,000 during the peak weeks (late January–early February 2025). The exact figures from the weekly tracking are not available in the retrieved data, but the season's severity profile is directly comparable to 2017–18, which had a preliminary upper bound of 1.35 million.

The **final** 2024–25 estimate has not yet been incorporated into the historical range statement as of May 2025, suggesting it may still be pending finalization.

### 2018–19 through 2023–24 (excluding 2020–21)
None of these seasons had upper bounds exceeding 800,000. The CDC's consistent statement that end-of-season estimates from 2010–2024 ranged from **120,000–710,000** confirms this. The 2020–21 season had near-zero influenza activity due to COVID-19 mitigation measures and is effectively excluded from meaningful comparison.

## 2025–26 Season: Current Status and Forecasting Implications

The CDC's 2025–26 Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden page (active as of November 21, 2025) states:
- Past end-of-season estimates (2010–2025) ranged from **120,000–710,000**
- This range now includes 2024–25 in its upper bound reference year, suggesting the 2024–25 final estimate was incorporated and remained at or near 710,000

The NFID page (updated February 2026) reports: *"According to preliminary estimates for the 2025-2026 flu season, there have been at least 23 million illnesses, **300,000 hospitalizations**, and 19,000 deaths from flu so far this season."* This figure of ~300,000 hospitalizations as of mid-February 2026 represents the **lower bound** of the current range estimate.

For context:
- The FluView Week 1 (ending January 3, 2026) data shows influenza activity was increasing, with H3N2 predominating
- Week 51 (ending December 20, 2025) showed increasing positivity rates, with Region 8 at 34.9%
- The 2025–26 season appears to be a **moderate-to-high severity** season based on early indicators

**For the 850,000 upper bound threshold**: Given that the current lower bound estimate is ~300,000 as of mid-February 2026, and the season is still active, the upper bound is likely in the range of **400,000–600,000** at this point in the season. For the upper bound to reach 850,000 before April 5, 2026, the season would need to intensify significantly beyond current projections — approaching 2017–18 or 2024–25 severity levels. The CDC's moderate severity outlook for 2025–26 makes this less likely, but the season is ongoing and the outcome remains uncertain.

---

## Key Conclusions

1. **Seasons where the preliminary hospitalization upper bound definitively exceeded 800,000**: **2017–18** (upper bound: 1,357,043, confirmed by archived CDC data)

2. **Seasons where the preliminary hospitalization upper bound almost certainly exceeded 800,000**: **2024–25** (high severity, most severe since 2017–18, though exact weekly figures not retrieved)

3. **All other seasons (2018–19 through 2023–24)**: Upper bounds did not exceed 800,000

4. **Date the 800,000 threshold was first reached in 2017–18**: Not precisely documented in available data; likely **late January or early February 2018** based on the season's trajectory

5. **2025–26 season**: As of mid-February 2026, the lower bound estimate is ~300,000 hospitalizations; reaching an upper bound of 850,000 before April 5, 2026 would require exceptional late-season intensification beyond current moderate severity projections</Agent_report>
