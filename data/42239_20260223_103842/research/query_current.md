Analysis:
The key to judging whether the 850 k threshold is likely to be crossed is knowing the most recent CDC in-season burden estimate for 2025-26 and its trajectory. The CDC updates that estimate weekly (usually on Friday) and the figure is frequently quoted in FluView, CDC press releases, and health-news coverage. Therefore, the most relevant articles will be very recent (February 2026) pieces citing the current hospitalization range or analysts commenting on season severity. Good search terms must include: “CDC”, “flu burden” or “preliminary estimate”, the season “2025-26”, and “hospitalizations”. Google web search can pull the actual CDC page, Google News can surface the freshest journalism, and AskNews can retrieve explanatory pieces summarizing the latest numbers and outlook.
