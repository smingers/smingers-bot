Analysis:
Key context: How high CDC’s in-season cumulative hospitalization estimates have gone in past flu seasons, and how quickly they rise. Historical peak upper-bound figures from the “Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden” pages for 2017-18, 2018-19, 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25, etc. will anchor an outside view of whether 850 k is plausible before early April 2026. We therefore want pages that show the CDC’s historical hospitalization burden ranges and recent media or CDC commentary on unusually severe seasons.
