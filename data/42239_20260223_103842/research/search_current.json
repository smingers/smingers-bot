On that day, influenza-like illness visits reached about 2,422, up 3.2% from 2,348 the day before, and diarrhea visits reached about 2,402, up 2.7% from 2,338. Compared to the same Lunar New Year dates over the past three years, influenza-like illness visits were 33.1% lower than in 2025, 6.6% lower than in 2024, and 35.1% higher than in 2023. Diarrhea visits were 37.9% lower than in 2025, 101% higher than in 2024, and 93.2% higher than in 2023. CDC spokesperson Lin Ming-cheng stated that after school reopens, outbreaks of norovirus clusters and enterovirus may rise, and the influenza strain has shifted, with B-type influenza increasing and A-type decreasing, showing a 'B-increase, A-decrease' trend. Lin warned that B-type influenza may surpass A-type in prevalence within the next one to two weeks, raising the risk of reinfection. The CDC emphasized that norovirus, enterovirus, and influenza are closely linked to personal hygiene. Since alcohol-based disinfectants are less effective against norovirus and enterovirus, proper handwashing with soap is recommended. Older adults, children, and those with weakened immunity should wear masks and monitor their health when visiting crowded places.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 07:45 AM\nSource:[ETtoday\u5065\u5eb7\u96f2](https://health.ettoday.net/news/3121787)\n\n**Diarrhea Outbreaks Rise Amid Concerns Over Norovirus, B-Flu, and Enterovirus Post-Lunar New Year**\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Taiwan reported a continuous rise in diarrhea-related cases since the first week of 2026, with norovirus accounting for over 80% of cases. Although influenza cases are declining, the proportion of type B influenza (B-flu) is rapidly increasing and is approaching that of type A. The CDC noted that the recent holiday period created a 'group transition phase,' increasing the risk of outbreaks in workplaces and schools. On February 22, 2026, there were approximately 2,402 emergency department visits for diarrhea\u2014up 2.7% from the previous day and 101% higher than the same period in 2023, though still lower than the same period in 2024. For influenza, emergency visits totaled about 2,422, a 3.2% increase from the previous day and a 33.1% decrease compared to the same day in 2024. The CDC's Deputy Director, Lin Ming-cheng, emphasized that norovirus is highly contagious and urged the public to practice preventive measures, including proper handwashing with soap, avoiding cross-contamination in food preparation, and disinfecting surfaces and clothing with diluted bleach. He also warned that B-flu is on the verge of surpassing A-flu, with B-flu increasing from 28% to 38.1% and A-flu decreasing from 68% to 59.5% after the Lunar New Year. Additionally, enterovirus cases are expected to rise after the holiday season, with peak incidence typically occurring around the Dragon Boat Festival and declining after summer vacation. The CDC reiterated the importance of hygiene and preventive practices during this high-risk period.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 05:55 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20260223002368-260405)\n\n**Post-Lunar New Year School Return: CDC Warns of Norovirus, Enterovirus Outbreaks and Flu Shift to Type B**\nThe Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that emergency department visits for influenza-like illness and diarrhea increased by approximately 3% compared to the previous day. On February 22, 2026, influenza-like illness emergency visits reached about 2,400 cases, a 3.2% increase from the prior day, and were 33.1% lower than the same lunar calendar date in 2025, 6.6% lower than in 2024, but 35.1% higher than in 2023.

CDC spokesperson Lin Ming-cheng warned that three infectious diseases are of concern after the Lunar New Year: norovirus, which often causes outbreaks in schools after the break; enterovirus, which may rise in incidence; and influenza, where type B is expected to surpass type A in prevalence within the next one to two weeks, increasing the risk of reinfection. The CDC emphasized that norovirus and enterovirus are not killed by alcohol, urging the public to use soap and water for handwashing to prevent multiple infections. High-risk groups, including the elderly and young children, should wear masks in crowded places. The government has allocated NT$1.6 billion to incentivize primary care clinics to open during the holiday, and special outpatient clinics were established to reduce emergency department congestion, alleviating the overcrowding seen in previous years.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 05:25 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/7266/9339212)\n\n**Back-to-School and Back-to-Work Alert: Preventing Flu and Norovirus Outbreaks Amid Rising Travel Risks**\nFollowing the 9-day spring break, schools and workplaces are reopening, prompting health authorities to issue warnings about potential resurgence of infectious diseases. The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that while influenza cases declined during the Lunar New Year period, B-type influenza is increasingly replacing A-type, with community prevalence nearly equal. With increased social interactions post-holidays, the risk of outbreaks in schools and group settings remains high. According to CDC Deputy Director Lin Ming-cheng, outpatient visits for influenza-like illness dropped to 2,069 on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, a 19.5% decrease from the previous day (2,571), and significantly lower than the same period in the past three years\u201461% lower than 2025 (5,303), 38.3% lower than 2024 (3,351), and 4.9% lower than 2023 (2,175). Despite the decline, vigilance is still required. In addition to influenza, dengue prevention remains critical, with 10 imported cases reported by February 6, 2026, primarily from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The CDC urges schools to maintain mosquito control and promote proper handwashing. For travelers to Japan and South Korea, the CDC warns of ongoing outbreaks: South Korea reported 709 norovirus cases in week 5 (January 25\u201331), the highest in five years, while Japan saw the highest rate of infectious gastroenteritis in a decade, with an average of 9.42 cases per healthcare facility in week 5 (January 26\u2013February 1). Norovirus is highly contagious and resistant to alcohol, with children under six being especially vulnerable. The CDC advises travelers to avoid raw foods and practice strict hand hygiene.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 04:29 AM\nSource:[\u4e09\u7acb\u65b0\u805e](https://www.setn.com/News.aspx)\n\n**Alcohol Ineffective! Norovirus and Enterovirus May Rise in School Season \u2013 Soap and Water Are Key**\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Taiwan warns that norovirus and enterovirus are still active in communities, with enterovirus cases entering an upward phase and norovirus potentially peaking at the start of the school term. The CDC emphasizes that alcohol-based hand sanitizers are ineffective against these viruses, which are non-enveloped, and that handwashing with soap is essential. According to the latest data, outpatient visits for influenza-like illness rose to 2,422 on the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, a 3.2% increase from the previous day, though still lower than in 2025 and 2024. Gastrointestinal emergency visits reached 2,402, up 2.7% from the previous day and significantly higher than in 2024 (1,195) and 2023 (1,243), indicating a rising threat. The CDC noted that emergency room congestion improved during the Lunar New Year due to outpatient\u5206\u6d41 measures, including expanded primary care clinics and special flu clinics. However, with students returning to school, the risk of outbreaks increases. The CDC has raised the alert level for enterovirus and will initiate school and childcare facility inspections if the outbreak threshold is met. Influenza has shifted from A-type dominance to a rising trend in B-type cases, which may soon surpass A-type. The CDC recommends cleaning high-touch surfaces with a 1:1,000 bleach solution (1 capful of bleach per 1,000 cc of water) for effective disinfection.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 04:29 AM\nSource:[\u5065\u5eb7\u91ab\u7642](https://health.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/5348487)\n\n**Spring Festival Season: Influenza and Diarrhea Cases Drop, but Norovirus Threat Remains After Holiday**\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, acute respiratory infection and diarrhea emergency department visits in Taiwan decreased by 19.5% and 11.5% respectively on the last day of the Lunar New Year holiday (February 21, 2026), compared to the previous day. These numbers are also significantly lower than the same period last year, with a 61% drop in acute respiratory infections and a 72.5% drop in diarrhea cases.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirmed these figures on X, noting a hospital attack in Sennar state that killed three patients and wounded seven, including a staff member. Earlier in the month, three other attacks in South Kordofan resulted in over 30 deaths. Since the war began in April 2023, the WHO has documented at least 206 attacks on medical facilities, leading to approximately 2,000 deaths and hundreds of injuries. In 2025 alone, 65 attacks killed over 1,620 people, accounting for 80% of global deaths linked to attacks on healthcare. The ongoing civil war, now entering its fourth year, has caused tens of thousands of deaths and displaced 11 million people, creating one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises. The country faces multiple disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, dengue, and measles, alongside severe malnutrition: 4.2 million acute malnutrition cases are projected in 2026, including over 800,000 severe cases.

The WHO's Full Value of Improved Influenza Vaccine Assessment (FVIVA) and a related article in the journal *Vaccine* evaluate the health, economic, and policy impacts of these advanced vaccines, identifying key barriers to global uptake. Seasonal influenza causes approximately one billion infections annually, with 3 to 5 million severe cases and 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory-related deaths. Current vaccines vary in effectiveness by season, population, and product, and provide protection for only one season. Despite 143 countries reporting availability of seasonal vaccines, upper-middle and high-income nations use the majority of doses. The FVIVA estimates that widespread use of next-generation or universal vaccines could reduce unnecessary antibiotic use by up to 1.3 billion defined daily doses between 2025 and 2050, significantly contributing to global efforts against antimicrobial resistance. These vaccines are projected to remain cost-effective or even cost-saving in many countries. The WHO's Preferred Product Characteristics, updated in December 2025, emphasize broader, longer-lasting protection, better efficacy against severe disease, suitability for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and transferable technologies to support local manufacturing. As of February 2026, 46 next-generation influenza vaccines are in clinical development across diverse platforms, as reported by the Influenza Vaccines R&D Roadmap. The FVIVA framework supports evidence-based decision-making among governments, researchers, manufacturers, and partners, aligning with WHO\u2019s Global Influenza Strategy 2019\u20132030 and the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of the final week of December 2025, the season has caused an estimated 11 million illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths. This represents a significant increase from the 2024-25 season, which saw 5.3 million illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations, and 2,700 deaths by December 28, 2024. The CDC reported 33,301 influenza patients admitted to hospitals in the week ending December 27, 2025, a sharp rise from earlier weeks. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness reached 8.2% of all health care visits, exceeding seasonal baselines. Influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant strain, accounting for over 91% of subtyped influenza A cases, with 90.5% of 389 genetically characterized A(H3N2) viruses belonging to subclade K. Public health experts attribute the surge to holiday travel, low vaccination rates, misinformation, and a partial vaccine mismatch. One pediatric flu-related death was reported in the latest week, bringing the season\u2019s total to nine. Experts, including Eric Ascher of Northwell\u2019s Lenox Hill Hospital, note that flu cases are under-reported and predict the peak will occur in at least another one to two weeks. Aaron Milstone of Johns Hopkins University cautioned against premature conclusions about the season\u2019s trajectory.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 04:11 AM\nSource:[KSL.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51428543/cdc-says-2025-26-flu-season-moderately-severe-as-cases-hit-11-million)\n\n**CDC Labels 2025-26 Flu Season 'Moderately Severe' With 11 million Illnesses So Far**\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has classified the 2025-26 flu season as 'moderately severe,' estimating at least 11 million illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths as of January 5, 2026. This marks a significant increase compared to the same period in the previous season, which saw 5.3 million illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations, and 2,700 deaths.

Last year\u2019s flu season was one of the most severe since 2010, with a hospitalization rate of 127.1 per 100,000 people, resulting in at least 47 million illnesses, 21 million healthcare visits, 610,000 hospitalizations, and 28,000 flu-related deaths according to preliminary CDC estimates. The CDC has never recorded two consecutive high-severity flu seasons in over 20 years of tracking, but acknowledges it is possible. Therefore, the agency forecasts a moderate impact across all age groups. Additionally, the CDC analyzed the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s flu season (April\u2013September 2025), which serves as a predictor for the Northern Hemisphere. The flu vaccine was 50.4% effective at preventing outpatient visits and 49.7% effective at preventing hospitalizations in the Southern Hemisphere. Since the 2025-2026 flu vaccine has the same composition as the one used in the Southern Hemisphere, the CDC suggests it 'might be similarly effective if the same viruses circulate in the coming season.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[Hospital Review](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/public-health/cdc-projects-moderate-flu-season-what-to-know/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
