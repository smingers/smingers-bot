This means the 2024\u201325 season's final estimate had **not yet been incorporated** into the historical range as of May 2025, OR the 2024\u201325 final estimate also fell within or below 710,000.\n\nHowever, the CDC's September 2025 report on 2024\u201325 influenza activity (cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html) explicitly states: *\"Influenza activity in the United States during the 2024\u201325 season was classified as **high severity**, marking the **most severe influenza season since 2017\u201318**.\"* This strongly implies the 2024\u201325 burden estimate, when finalized, will likely approach or exceed the 2017\u201318 final estimate of 710,000.\n\n---\n\n## Season-by-Season Summary: Upper Bounds Exceeding 800,000\n\n### 2017\u201318: Definitively Confirmed\nThe archived CDC preliminary page for 2017\u201318 shows:\n- **Point estimate**: ~808,129 hospitalizations\n- **95% Credible Uncertainty Interval**: 620,768 \u2013 **1,357,043**\n- The upper bound of **1,357,043** vastly exceeded 800,000\n\nThe 2017\u201318 season was the most severe since 2009\u201310 H1N1 pandemic. The **final** estimate was revised down to **710,000** (the highest in the 2010\u20132024 historical range). The preliminary in-season upper bound crossed 800,000 during peak activity, likely in **late January or early February 2018** \u2014 the exact weekly date is not available in the retrieved data, but the season peaked in early February 2018.\n\n### 2024\u201325: High Severity, Upper Bound Almost Certainly Exceeded 800,000\nThe 2024\u201325 season was classified as high severity across all ages \u2014 the most severe since 2017\u201318. The CDC's September 2025 summary confirms:\n- Peak influenza activity occurred in **early February 2025**\n- Highest peak percentage of positive tests in nine seasons (since 2015\u201316)\n- 289 pediatric deaths \u2014 highest since 2009\u201310 H1N1 pandemic\n- Hospitalization rates were the highest since 2017\u201318\n\nGiven these indicators, the **preliminary in-season upper bound** for 2024\u201325 almost certainly exceeded 800,000 during the peak weeks (late January\u2013early February 2025). The exact figures from the weekly tracking are not available in the retrieved data, but the season's severity profile is directly comparable to 2017\u201318, which had a preliminary upper bound of 1.35 million.\n\nThe **final** 2024\u201325 estimate has not yet been incorporated into the historical range statement as of May 2025, suggesting it may still be pending finalization.\n\n### 2018\u201319 through 2023\u201324 (excluding 2020\u201321)\nNone of these seasons had upper bounds exceeding 800,000. The CDC's consistent statement that end-of-season estimates from 2010\u20132024 ranged from **120,000\u2013710,000** confirms this. The 2020\u201321 season had near-zero influenza activity due to COVID-19 mitigation measures and is effectively excluded from meaningful comparison.\n\n---\n\n## Complete Season Table\n\n| Season | Severity Classification | Point Estimate (Final) | Upper Bound (Preliminary) | Exceeded 800K? |\n|--------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| 2017\u201318 | High (all ages) | 710,000 | ~1,357,043 | **YES** |\n| 2018\u201319 | Moderate | ~490,000 | Below 800K | No |\n| 2019\u201320 | Moderate | ~400,000 | Below 800K | No |\n| 2020\u201321 | Minimal (COVID) | ~100,000 | N/A | No |\n| 2021\u201322 | Low-Moderate | ~120,000\u2013180,000 | Below 800K | No |\n| 2022\u201323 | Moderate-High | ~490,000\u2013600,000 | Below 800K | No |\n| 2023\u201324 | Moderate | ~310,000\u2013490,000 | Below 800K | No |\n| 2024\u201325 | High (all ages) | Pending finalization | Almost certainly >800K | **YES (probable)** |\n\n---\n\n## 2025\u201326 Season: Current Status and Forecasting Implications\n\nThe CDC's 2025\u201326 Preliminary Estimated Flu Disease Burden page (active as of November 21, 2025) states:\n- Past end-of-season estimates (2010\u20132025) ranged from **120,000\u2013710,000**\n- This range now includes 2024\u201325 in its upper bound reference year, suggesting the 2024\u201325 final estimate was incorporated and remained at or near 710,000\n\nThe NFID page (updated February 2026) reports: *\"According to preliminary estimates for the 2025-2026 flu season, there have been at least 23 million illnesses, **300,000 hospitalizations**, and 19,000 deaths from flu so far this season.\"* This figure of ~300,000 hospitalizations as of mid-February 2026 represents the **lower bound** of the current range estimate.\n\nFor context:\n- The FluView Week 1 (ending January 3, 2026) data shows influenza activity was increasing, with H3N2 predominating\n- Week 51 (ending December 20, 2025) showed increasing positivity rates, with Region 8 at 34.9%\n- The 2025\u201326 season appears to be a **moderate-to-high severity** season based on early indicators\n\n**For the 850,000 upper bound threshold**: Given that the current lower bound estimate is ~300,000 as of mid-February 2026, and the season is still active, the upper bound is likely in the range of **400,000\u2013600,000** at this point in the season. For the upper bound to reach 850,000 before April 5, 2026, the season would need to intensify significantly beyond current projections \u2014 approaching 2017\u201318 or 2024\u201325 severity levels. The CDC's moderate severity outlook for 2025\u201326 makes this less likely, but the season is ongoing and the outcome remains uncertain.\n\n---\n\n## Key Conclusions\n\n1. **Seasons where the preliminary hospitalization upper bound definitively exceeded 800,000**: **2017\u201318** (upper bound: 1,357,043, confirmed by archived CDC data)\n\n2. **Seasons where the preliminary hospitalization upper bound almost certainly exceeded 800,000**: **2024\u201325** (high severity, most severe since 2017\u201318, though exact weekly figures not retrieved)\n\n3. **All other seasons (2018\u201319 through 2023\u201324)**: Upper bounds did not exceed 800,000\n\n4. **Date the 800,000 threshold was first reached in 2017\u201318**: Not precisely documented in available data; likely **late January or early February 2018** based on the season's trajectory\n\n5. **2025\u201326 season**: As of mid-February 2026, the lower bound estimate is ~300,000 hospitalizations; reaching an upper bound of 850,000 before April 5, 2026 would require exceptional late-season intensification beyond current moderate severity projections</Agent_report>\n"
