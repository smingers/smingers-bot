Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

The current information sources are largely irrelevant to the specific question of when Cannes will announce its 2026 official selection:

- **Numéro (Jan 9 / Feb 16, 2026)**: Fashion/culture magazine speculating about potential 2026 Cannes competition films. Non-official, speculative. Confirms no official selection announced as of mid-February 2026. Low relevance to timing question.

- **Variety (undated, late 2025/early 2026)**: Trade publication covering potential 2026 festival films. Notes Thierry Frémaux conducting LA scouting trips in January. No information about announcement timing. Moderate quality, low relevance.

- **IMDb/Buzz Focus (April 15, 2010)**: Historical document confirming the 2010 Cannes official selection was announced April 15, 2010 — after the April 10 threshold. Strong quality as a historical data point.

- **AskNews articles**: None of the AskNews articles contain any information about when Cannes will announce its 2026 official selection. They cover unrelated topics (Cannes Lions, other film festivals, AI festivals, recruitment for festival staff). The recruitment article confirms the 79th Cannes Film Festival runs May 12-23, 2026, which is consistent with historical patterns.

- **Raoul Peck documentary article**: Mentions a film premiering at Cannes Film Festival on February 25, 2026 — this appears to be in the "Cannes Première" section of the 2026 festival, but the date (February 25, 2026) seems inconsistent with the May 2026 festival dates. This may be referring to a different screening event or the article has an error. Not directly relevant.

No current sources provide any information suggesting Cannes has pre-announced an earlier-than-usual selection announcement date for 2026.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence (supporting "No"):**
- Historical record (2010-2025): 0 instances in 12+ years where the official selection was announced before April 10. The 2010 announcement was April 15; 2024 was April 11; 2025 was April 10 (on the threshold, not before). This is a strong structural pattern with high predictive power.
- No current sources indicate any deviation from historical norms for 2026.

**Moderate evidence (supporting "No"):**
- The 2025 announcement on April 10 itself doesn't satisfy "before April 10," meaning even the most recent and earliest-ever announcement wouldn't have resolved this "Yes."
- The festival runs May 12-23, 2026, consistent with historical timing, suggesting no structural reason to announce earlier.

**Weak evidence (supporting "Yes"):**
- Trend toward slightly earlier announcements over the decade (from ~April 17-18 to ~April 10). If this trend continued by one more day, an April 9 announcement would be possible.
- Thierry Frémaux conducting LA scouting in January 2026 (per Variety) is consistent with normal preparation — no signal of accelerated timeline.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- Today: February 24, 2026. Resolution date: April 10, 2026. Approximately 45 days remain.
- The announcement window historically falls April 10-18. The question asks about "before April 10."
- If the timeframe were halved (resolving ~March 17): probability would drop to near 0%, as no Cannes selection has ever been announced in March.
- If the timeframe were doubled (resolving ~May 20): probability would approach ~95%+, as the festival itself starts May 12 and the selection would certainly be announced by then.
- The current timeframe captures the exact boundary of historical announcement dates, making this a very tight question.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate is 0% based on 12+ years of historical data. The current information provides no evidence to shift this materially upward. Key factors:

1. **Zero historical precedent**: No Cannes official selection has ever been announced before April 10 in the modern era (2010-2025). This is the strongest anchor.

2. **2025 precedent is the closest**: The April 10, 2025 announcement is the earliest on record, but it still doesn't satisfy "before April 10." For 2026 to resolve "Yes," Cannes would need to announce on April 9 or earlier — unprecedented.

3. **No signals of change**: No current sources (as of February 24, 2026) indicate any planned deviation from historical norms. No pre-announcement of an earlier date, no institutional changes signaled.

4. **Structural constraints remain**: Films continue to be finalized through March/April; the selection process requires adequate screening time. These constraints haven't changed.

5. **Modest trend toward earlier announcements**: The only factor supporting "Yes" is the gradual trend from ~April 17 (2014) to April 10 (2025). If this continued, an April 9 announcement is conceivable but would still be unprecedented.

The probability should remain very close to the base rate of ~4% (allowing for genuine uncertainty about future behavior and the possibility of an unprecedented early announcement). Given the complete absence of any current evidence suggesting an earlier announcement, I see no reason to shift meaningfully from the outside view.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view is 4%. Current information provides:
- No evidence supporting an earlier announcement
- Confirmation that as of February 24, 2026, no selection has been announced
- Historical data point (2010: April 15) reinforcing the pattern

I'll maintain the estimate at approximately 4%, perhaps nudging slightly lower given that no current information provides any upward pressure. The 2025 "April 10" precedent is the most relevant recent data point, and even that doesn't satisfy the criteria. I'll set my inside view at 4%.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Cannes publish its 2026 official selection list on the official website before April 10, 2026? (Partial teasers don't count.)

2. **Outside view base rate**: 0% historically (0/12+ years); adjusted to ~4% for genuine uncertainty. Final prediction is rooted to this near-zero base rate.

3. **Consistency check**: "4 out of 100 times, Cannes publishes its official 2026 selection before April 10, 2026." This is consistent — it's a rare but non-impossible event given the trend toward earlier announcements.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - 0/12 historical instances of pre-April 10 announcement (strong, factual)
   - 2025 announcement was April 10 (on threshold, not before) — strong, factual
   - 2024 announcement was April 11 — strong, factual
   - No current signals of earlier 2026 announcement — moderate, factual
   - Modest trend toward earlier announcements — weak, directional

5. **Blind-spot**: Cannes could decide to announce earlier for strategic reasons (e.g., competition with other festivals, streaming platform deals requiring earlier marketing windows). This could shift probability to ~15-20%, but there's no evidence of this.

6. **Status quo outcome**: The status quo is "No" — the announcement happens on or after April 10, as it always has. The world changes slowly; the status quo strongly favors "No."

Probability: 4%
