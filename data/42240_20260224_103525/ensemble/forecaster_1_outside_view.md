Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Screen Daily (March 19, 2025)**: Reputable trade publication confirming the 2025 Cannes Official Selection announcement date as April 10, 2025. High quality, factual reporting from a credible industry source.

2. **Deadline (March 19, 2025)**: Major entertainment industry outlet confirming the same April 10, 2025 announcement date. High quality, corroborates Screen Daily.

3. **Sortiraparis.com**: Secondary source summarizing the 2025 selection after the fact. Confirms the April 10 announcement date and notes a second wave followed. Moderate quality but consistent with primary sources.

4. **Le Monde (April 10, 2025)**: Major French newspaper reporting on the actual April 10, 2025 announcement. High quality, confirms the date as historical fact.

5. **IndieWire (2025 predictions piece)**: Speculation/preview article about 2025 Cannes films. Not directly relevant to the resolution criteria but provides context. Low relevance to the question.

6. **Screen Daily (April 11, 2024)**: Confirms the 2024 Official Selection was announced on April 11, 2024 — one day after the April 10 threshold. High quality, directly relevant historical data point.

7. **Agent Report**: Comprehensive analysis of Cannes announcement dates from 2014–2025. The agent concludes that in all 12 years examined, the announcement was never made strictly before April 10. The 2025 announcement on April 10 is the earliest in modern history. This is a well-structured analysis with good sourcing, though some dates (2015–2019, 2022–2023) are approximated rather than precisely confirmed. The overall conclusion is well-supported.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are applicable:

- **Cannes Official Selection announcement dates (2014–2025)**: The most directly relevant class. In 12 years, 0 announcements were made before April 10. The earliest was April 10, 2025 (which doesn't satisfy "before April 10"). Base rate: 0/12 = 0%.

- **Major film festival selection announcement timing**: Festivals generally announce selections 4-6 weeks before the festival opens. Cannes typically runs mid-to-late May, making April 10-18 the natural window. This structural constraint makes pre-April 10 announcements unlikely.

- **Institutional behavior change**: Organizations occasionally shift timelines. The trend shows modest movement from April 17-18 (2014, 2019) toward April 10 (2025). A further shift to before April 10 is conceivable but would be unprecedented.

The most suitable reference class is the direct historical record of Cannes announcement dates (2014–2025), which gives a base rate of 0%.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- Today is February 24, 2026. The question resolves April 10, 2026 — approximately 45 days away.
- The question asks whether the announcement will happen before April 10, 2026.
- Historical pattern: Cannes announces in the April 10-18 window in normal years. The 2025 announcement was on April 10 (not before). The 2024 announcement was April 11.
- The trend is toward slightly earlier announcements over the decade, but the movement has been from ~April 17 to ~April 10 over 10+ years — roughly one day earlier per year at the extreme. Moving to before April 10 would require breaking the trend's boundary.
- No information suggests Cannes has pre-announced an earlier date for 2026.

**(d) Justification**

The historical base rate is 0% for announcements strictly before April 10. The 2025 announcement on April 10 is the closest Cannes has come to the threshold, but it still doesn't satisfy the resolution criteria. The structural logic is clear: Cannes needs sufficient time to screen films (which continue arriving through March/April), and announcing 5+ weeks before the festival (which typically opens around May 13-17) is already at the early end of their practice.

For 2026 to resolve "Yes," Cannes would need to break with its entire documented modern history. While there's a modest trend toward earlier announcements, the jump from "on April 10" to "before April 10" is small in absolute terms but would still be unprecedented.

Factors that could push toward "Yes" (but are speculative):
- Continued trend toward earlier announcements
- Some logistical or strategic reason to announce earlier in 2026
- The 2026 festival being scheduled earlier than usual (no evidence of this)

Factors supporting "No":
- 0/12 historical base rate
- No pre-announcement of an earlier date for 2026
- Structural constraints (films still arriving in March/April)
- Leadership continuity (Knobloch through 2027) suggests no major procedural changes

Outside view calibration:

The base rate is 0% across 12 years. However, I should not assign exactly 0% because:
- There is genuine uncertainty about future behavior
- The trend toward earlier announcements is real
- The 2025 announcement was exactly on the threshold, making a 2026 announcement one day earlier (April 9) conceivable
- Unknown factors could shift the timeline

However, the probability should be very low — perhaps 3-5%. The "on April 10" precedent from 2025 is the most relevant recent data point, and even that doesn't satisfy the criteria. The probability of the announcement being on April 9 or earlier in 2026 is small but non-zero.

I'll set this at approximately 4%, reflecting the near-zero historical base rate with a small allowance for the possibility of an unprecedented early announcement.
