Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Numéro Magazine (Jan 9 / updated Feb 16, 2026)** – Fashion/culture publication aggregating rumors about potential 2026 Cannes competition films. Non-official source; purely speculative. Confirms no official selection announced as of mid-February 2026. Low evidentiary value for timing question.

2. **Variety (undated, early 2026)** – Reputable trade publication discussing films potentially targeting Cannes/Venice 2026. Notes Thierry Frémaux conducting LA scouting trip in January. No information about announcement timing. Moderate quality source, but irrelevant to timing question.

3. **IMDb/Buzz Focus (April 15, 2010)** – Historical document confirming 2010 official selection was announced April 15, 2010 — after the April 10 threshold. Single historical data point supporting "No" resolution.

4. **AskNews articles** – Multiple articles about Cannes-adjacent topics (Cannes Lions, AI festival, job recruitment for 79th festival, Berlinale 2026, etc.). None contain information about the timing of the 2026 official selection announcement. The recruitment article confirms the festival runs May 12–23, 2026, consistent with prior knowledge.

5. **Raoul Peck documentary article (Feb 24, 2026)** – States a documentary will "premiere on February 25, 2026, at the Cannes Film Festival in the Cannes Première section." This is almost certainly an error or refers to a different screening event (perhaps a pre-festival screening or a different "Cannes" event), as the main festival runs in May. This does not constitute an official selection announcement.

**No source provides any evidence that Cannes has announced or plans to announce its 2026 official selection before April 10, 2026.**

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence (supporting "No"):**
- Historical pattern (2010-2025): In every normal year, Cannes announces its official selection in mid-April, with the earliest being April 10, 2025. Zero instances of pre-April 10 announcement in the historical record. This is a structural/institutional pattern with strong predictive power.
- The festival runs May 12–23, 2026, consistent with prior years. No structural reason to announce significantly earlier.
- As of February 24, 2026 (today), no announcement has been made and no press conference date has been publicized — Cannes typically pre-announces the press conference date ~3 weeks in advance, meaning we'd expect that meta-announcement around March 20 at the earliest.

**Moderate evidence (supporting "No"):**
- The recruitment article mentions recruitment "between February and late April 2026," suggesting the festival's own operational timeline doesn't anticipate an unusually early announcement.
- No trade press speculation about an early announcement date.

**Weak evidence (potentially supporting "Yes"):**
- The secular trend toward earlier announcements (from ~April 17 in 2014 to April 10 in 2025) could theoretically continue to push the date to April 9 or earlier in 2026. However, this is a weak trend with high variance, and the 2025 date of April 10 is exactly at the resolution threshold — one day earlier would resolve "Yes."
- The Raoul Peck article mentions a "February 25, 2026" Cannes premiere, but this almost certainly refers to a different event or is an error; it does not constitute an official selection announcement.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Days remaining:** 45 days (Feb 24 to Apr 10, 2026).
- **If timeframe halved (~22 days, to ~March 17):** Probability would drop to near 0%, as Cannes has never announced in March.
- **If timeframe doubled (~90 days, to ~May 25):** Probability would approach ~95%+, as the festival itself would have occurred.
- The current 45-day window is the critical one: it encompasses the expected announcement date (mid-April) but the resolution cutoff is April 10, which is at or just before the historical earliest date.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate is 9% (Laplace-adjusted from 0/10 normal years, with a modest upward adjustment for the secular trend toward earlier dates).

Current information provides **no new evidence** that shifts this meaningfully. There is:
- No announcement made yet (consistent with historical pattern)
- No pre-announcement of a press conference date (which Cannes typically does ~3 weeks in advance)
- No trade press speculation about an unusually early 2026 announcement
- No structural change (same festival director, same May timing, same institutional calendar)

The only scenario that resolves "Yes" is if Cannes breaks its historical pattern and announces before April 10. The secular trend (earliest date moving from ~April 17 in 2014 to April 10 in 2025) suggests the 2026 announcement *might* land on April 9 or earlier, but this requires:
1. The trend to continue (uncertain)
2. The specific date chosen to fall before April 10 (April 9 is a Thursday in 2026, a plausible press conference day)

I estimate roughly a 10-12% chance the announcement lands before April 10, consistent with the outside view. No current information warrants a significant shift from the base rate.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view is 9%. Current evidence neither confirms nor contradicts this. The secular trend toward earlier dates provides a small upward nudge (perhaps +2-3%), while the absence of any early announcement signals or pre-announcement of press conference date provides a small downward nudge (perhaps -1-2%). Net effect: approximately neutral.

Final inside view: **~9%**

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Cannes publish its official 2026 selection list on its website before April 10, 2026? (A teaser doesn't count; must be a full selection announcement.)

2. **Base rate:** 9% (Laplace-adjusted from 0/10 historical normal years, with trend adjustment). Final prediction is anchored to this.

3. **Consistency check:** "9 out of 100 times, Cannes publishes its official 2026 selection before April 10, 2026." This is consistent — it's a rare but not impossible event given the secular trend toward earlier dates.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - Historical pattern: 0/10 normal years had pre-April 10 announcement (strong, factual)
   - 2025 announcement was exactly April 10 — one day earlier would have resolved Yes (strong, factual)
   - No current announcement or pre-announcement of press conference date (moderate, factual)
   - Secular trend toward earlier dates continues (weak, trend-based)
   - Festival confirmed May 12–23, 2026 (neutral, consistent with status quo)

5. **Blind spot:** If Cannes decided to move its announcement significantly earlier (e.g., to late March) due to competitive pressure from other festivals or streaming platforms, my forecast would look too low. However, there is zero evidence of this occurring.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo is "No announcement before April 10" — this has been true in every normal year. Slight nudge toward status quo is appropriate.

Probability: 9%
