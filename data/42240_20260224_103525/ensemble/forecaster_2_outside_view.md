Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Screen Daily (March 19, 2025)** – Reputable trade publication confirming Cannes 2025 Official Selection announcement date as April 10, 2025. High quality, factual reporting from a credible industry source.

2. **Deadline (March 19, 2025)** – Another top-tier trade publication confirming the April 10, 2025 announcement date. Corroborates Screen Daily. High quality.

3. **Sortiraparis (2025)** – French entertainment website summarizing the 2025 selection announced April 10. Secondary source but consistent with primary sources. Medium quality, factual content reliable.

4. **Le Monde (April 10, 2025)** – Major French newspaper confirming the April 10, 2025 announcement. High quality, authoritative.

5. **IndieWire (2025 predictions piece)** – Speculation/preview article about 2025 Cannes films. Not directly relevant to timing question. Low relevance.

6. **Screen Daily (April 11, 2024)** – Confirms 2024 Official Selection announced April 11, 2024 — one day after the April 10 threshold. High quality, directly relevant.

7. **Agent Report** – Comprehensive historical analysis of announcement dates 2014-2025. Well-researched with citations. Key finding: **0 out of 12 years (2014-2025) had announcements strictly before April 10**. The 2025 announcement on April 10 is the earliest in modern history. The trend shows a modest drift earlier (from April 17-18 toward April 10-13), but never before April 10.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

- **Most suitable reference class:** Cannes Film Festival Official Selection announcement dates, 2014-2025 (excluding pandemic years 2020-2021). This gives 10 normal years, all with announcements on or after April 10 (with 2025 being exactly April 10, and all prior years being April 11 or later).
- **Alternative reference class:** All major film festivals' selection announcement timing relative to their stated cutoff dates — less suitable due to different institutional practices.
- **Pandemic-adjusted class:** Excluding 2020-2021, the base rate for "before April 10" is 0/10 = 0%.

The most suitable reference class is the 10 normal years (2014-2019, 2022-2025), yielding a 0% historical base rate for announcements strictly before April 10.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- Today is February 24, 2026. The resolution date is April 10, 2026 — approximately 45 days away.
- The question asks whether Cannes will announce its 2026 Official Selection before April 10, 2026.
- Historical pattern: Cannes consistently announces in the April 10-18 window, with 2025 being the earliest at exactly April 10 (not before).
- The trend toward earlier announcements is real but modest: from ~April 17 (2014) to April 10 (2025) over 11 years — roughly one day earlier per year on average. Extrapolating this trend to 2026 might suggest April 9, but this is a very rough extrapolation and the trend is not linear.
- No known structural factors (new leadership, format change, pandemic) would push the 2026 announcement dramatically earlier.

**(d) Justification**

The historical base rate is unambiguous: in 12 years of documented history (2014-2025), Cannes has never announced its Official Selection strictly before April 10. The 2025 announcement on April 10 is the closest approach to the threshold. The resolution criteria require the announcement to be dated *before* April 10 — meaning April 10 itself would not count.

For a "Yes" resolution, Cannes would need to break with its entire documented modern history. While there is a modest trend toward earlier announcements, the magnitude required (even one day earlier than the 2025 record) represents an unprecedented shift. There is no known 2026-specific factor (new festival dates, leadership change, logistical reason) that would motivate such an early announcement.

The slight possibility of a "Yes" comes from: (1) the trend toward earlier announcements, (2) the possibility that Cannes pre-announces the date even earlier in 2026 and selects a date before April 10, and (3) unknown structural changes. However, these factors are speculative and run against strong historical evidence.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate is 0/12 = 0%. However, I should not assign exactly 0% because:
- There is a genuine (if small) trend toward earlier announcements
- Unknown future events could accelerate the timeline
- Model uncertainty warrants some probability mass on unexpected outcomes

The 2025 announcement was exactly on April 10 — the boundary. The question requires "before" April 10. Even if the trend continues at its historical pace (roughly 1 day earlier per year), 2026 might see an April 9 announcement — which would resolve "Yes." However, this extrapolation is highly uncertain, and the trend is not smooth or guaranteed.

Given the 0% historical base rate but acknowledging the small possibility of a trend-driven earlier announcement, I'd assign a very low probability — perhaps 3-5%. The trend argument is real but weak, and the historical evidence is overwhelming.
