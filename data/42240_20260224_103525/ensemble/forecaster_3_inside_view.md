Analysis:
**1) Paraphrase / what resolves**
This resolves **Yes** if the *official Cannes website press-release feed* publishes a dated announcement of the **2026 Official Selection** **before Apr 10, 2026** (teasers don’t count). Otherwise **No**.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)

**Strong evidence**
- **Historical pattern:** 2014–2025 shows **no** official selection announcements **before Apr 10**; 2025 was **Apr 10** (earliest, but fails “before”). This is a stable institutional behavior and hard to shift casually.
- **Status quo:** As of **Feb 24, 2026**, there is **no official selection** announcement (and none of the provided reputable sources suggest an earlier-than-usual planned date).

**Moderate evidence**
- **Slight trend earlier** (late-April drifting toward ~Apr 10–13). Trend supports a *small* chance of Apr 9 in 2026, but trend is noisy and bounded by institutional cadence (press conference scheduling, film confirmations, rights clearances).

**Weak evidence**
- **Operational hiring through late April (actu.fr):** Could weakly indicate Cannes is still in normal operational mode; doesn’t pin official selection date (which is typically earlier than late-April anyway).
- **Rumor/preview lists (Numéro/Variety):** Indicate active courting/industry chatter, but that’s normal and not predictive of the exact announcement date.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: **Feb 24, 2026**. Resolution cutoff: **Apr 10, 2026 (00:00)**. Time left: **~45 days**.
- If the remaining time were **halved (~22 days left, i.e., mid‑March)** and still no official announcement date/signals appeared, I would **lower** the Yes probability (less runway).
- If time were **doubled (~90 days left)**, I would keep a slightly higher uncertainty band (more chance for an institutional change), but Cannes’ timing is typically clustered in early April regardless.

## (d) Justification (inside view vs outside view)
**Outside view base rate:** ~**3.5%** (yours), anchored on “never before Apr 10” but allowing for nonzero tail risk and mild earlier drift.

**What’s changed since the outside view?** Nothing material pointing to an earlier announcement. Current articles are overwhelmingly *not about timing*; the only directly timing-relevant information remains the historical cadence. Cannes 2026 dates (May 12–23) look typical; no leadership change or structural disruption is cited.

So the inside view stays close to the outside view: a very small chance Cannes breaks precedent by **at least one day** (publishing on Apr 9 or earlier). The strongest “Yes” pathway is simply: **Cannes repeats 2025’s early behavior but nudges it one day earlier** (e.g., press conference/press release on Apr 9). The strongest “No” pathway is: **announcement on Apr 10–18**, consistent with essentially all modern years.

Probability calibration
- **Status quo continuation:** announcement around **Apr 10–13** (or later) ⇒ **No**.
- **Yes requires an unprecedented shift** (relative to 2014–2025) of at least **1 day earlier than the earliest observed boundary**.
- Given no new inside-view drivers, I make only a minimal adjustment from 3.5% → **4%** (reflecting residual uncertainty + mild drift earlier, but no confirming signals).

Checklist:
1) Criteria check: Yes only if official Cannes site posts an “Official Selection” announcement dated **before Apr 10, 2026** (not teasers; first wave counts).  
2) Outside view base rate used: **3.5%**.  
3) Consistency line: **4 out of 100** times, Cannes posts its 2026 official selection announcement on its official site **before Apr 10, 2026**.  
4) Key evidence:
   - 2014–2025: **0 years** with announcement strictly before Apr 10.
   - 2025 was **Apr 10** (earliest but still not “before”).
   - No credible reporting suggests an earlier-than-usual 2026 release.
   - Cannes timing is an institutional process; changes are usually incremental.  
5) Blind spot: Cannes could intentionally move the press conference **one day earlier** (Apr 9) for scheduling/PR reasons; that would push probability up (perhaps into ~10–15%) if credible hints emerged.  
6) Status quo outcome: Normal early‑April announcement cadence ⇒ **No**.

Probability: 4%
