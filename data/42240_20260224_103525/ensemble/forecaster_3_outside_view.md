Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis
- **ScreenDaily (Mar 19, 2025) – “Cannes confirms 2025 official selection announcement date”**  
  - **What it provides (facts):** Cannes *officially confirmed* the 2025 Official Selection announcement would be **April 10, 2025** (press conference in Paris).  
  - **Quality:** High. Trade outlet with good festival access; dated well before the event but reporting an official confirmation.  
  - **Usefulness:** Strong anchor for “how Cannes schedules this” (date-setting practice).

- **Deadline (Mar 19, 2025) – “Cannes sets date…”**  
  - **What it provides (facts):** Confirms the **April 10, 2025** announcement date and details (time, venue change).  
  - **Quality:** High-medium. Well-sourced entertainment trade; overlaps ScreenDaily.  
  - **Usefulness:** Corroboration.

- **Sortir à Paris roundup (about 2025 selection)**  
  - **What it provides (facts):** Says the 2025 selection press conference happened **April 10** and references later “additional announcements.”  
  - **Quality:** Medium-low for our purpose. It’s a secondary roundup, not the primary Cannes site.  
  - **Usefulness:** Minor corroboration only.

- **Le Monde (Apr 10, 2025) report**  
  - **What it provides (facts):** Reports the **April 10, 2025** selection announcement.  
  - **Quality:** High. Major newspaper; after-the-fact confirmation.  
  - **Usefulness:** Good confirmation of the realized date.

- **IndieWire predictions (2025)**  
  - **What it provides:** Speculation about films; no timing info for 2026.  
  - **Quality:** N/A to this question.

- **ScreenDaily (Apr 11, 2024) – “Cannes unveils 2024 official selection”**  
  - **What it provides (facts):** The 2024 lineup unveiled **April 11, 2024**.  
  - **Quality:** High.  
  - **Usefulness:** Important: shows the announcement can fall just *after* April 10.

- **Agent report (compiled dates 2014–2025; delayed years 2020/2021)**  
  - **What it provides (facts/claims):** A table of announcement dates, many marked with “~” approximations; highlights COVID disruption (2020 cancellation; 2021 delayed).  
  - **Quality:** Mixed. Useful as a *pointer*, but several dates are approximate and should be treated cautiously unless cross-verified. Still, the broad pattern (mid-April, with 2025 on April 10) matches high-quality sources for 2024–2025 and generally aligns with common festival calendars.  
  - **Usefulness:** Good for identifying the *range* and the existence of a stable seasonal pattern, but not as definitive for each pre-2024 exact date.

### (b) Reference class analysis
Plausible reference classes:
1. **Cannes Official Selection announcement timing (normal years) over the last ~10–12 editions** (excluding COVID-disrupted 2020–2021).  
   - **Suitability:** Highest. Same institution, same process, same incentives.
2. **Recent Cannes practice (post-pandemic “current regime”), e.g., 2022–2025**.  
   - **Suitability:** Also strong, because organizational practices can shift and then stabilize (communications cadence, venue, marketing lead times).
3. **Other A-list festivals’ lineup announcement timing** (Berlin/Venice/Toronto).  
   - **Suitability:** Lower. Cannes has its own longstanding cadence and strategic reasons.

**Chosen reference class:** (1) Cannes in normal years, with (2) used as a *recency-weighted modifier*.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: **2026-02-24**. Resolution cutoff: **before 2026-04-10**. That’s ~**45 days** away.
- Historically, Cannes announces the Official Selection roughly **mid-April**, several weeks before the festival (typically mid-May).  
- Key recent realized dates:
  - **2024:** April 11  
  - **2025:** April 10  
  These are extremely close to the threshold, suggesting the event is “on the margin.”

A crucial calendar observation from the historical dates given: announcements often cluster in the **second week of April**, and (notably in recent years) appear to be moving earlier by a day or two. If Cannes keeps roughly the same *relative lead time* to a likely mid-May 2026 festival start, **April 9** becomes a plausible announcement day—just inside the “Yes” condition.

### (d) Justification (outside view)
**Baseline (outside view) from the long-run record:**  
From 2014–2025 (normal years), the Official Selection announcement is consistently in **mid-April**, and **none** of the cited years clearly place the publication **before April 10**; 2025 is exactly **April 10**, and 2024 is **April 11**. Taken literally, that’s a very strong historical tilt to **“No.”**

**But the margin is extremely tight, and recent drift matters:**  
- The distribution is not “anytime in April”; it’s concentrated around a narrow window (roughly April 10–April 18 historically, with 2025 hitting April 10).  
- When a process sits near a threshold, small scheduling choices (weekday preference, venue availability, communications strategy, or simply aligning the press conference to the festival start date) can flip the outcome.  
- Recency suggests Cannes is comfortable announcing around **April 10–11**; if the 2026 festival dates pull slightly earlier, announcing on **April 9** (or earlier) becomes a natural, non-shocking move.

So the outside view is a tug-of-war between:
- **Historical base rate (strictly before Apr 10):** near-zero in the provided record.
- **Structural proximity to the cutoff + recent drift earlier:** meaning a non-trivial chance 2026 crosses the line.

Given how close the last two years are to the threshold, I treat “before April 10” in 2026 as a **meaningful upset risk**, not a tail event.

Outside view calibration:
- **Tether to sources:** The best-verified recent anchors are **Apr 11 (2024)** and **Apr 10 (2025)**. That places the “typical” outcome essentially at the cutoff.  
- **Upset rate / volatility:** Festival operational dates tend to be sticky but not perfectly; moving by 1 day is common. Because the threshold is only 0–1 days away from the recent norm, I assign a **substantial** (but <50/50?) chance of being earlier.  
- My calibrated view: the event is close to a coin flip but still slightly favors **No**, because breaking to *earlier than April 10* is still a step beyond the recent confirmed practice (which has reached April 10 but not earlier in the cited history).

Outside View Prediction:
