**Evaluating Cannes selection probability**

I need to look for sources to evaluate the probability of a Cannes selection being announced before April 10, 2026. Historically, announcements typically occur around April 12-18. There haven't been any before April 10 from 2014 to 2025. I estimate the chance could be around 6-8%, considering past trends and upward movement. Using a beta prior approach yields a range of around 4-8%. I'd set it around 6.8% for precision.**Analyzing Cannes announcement dates**

I need to analyze various sources for confirmation on the Cannes selection dates, focusing on quality. ScreenDaily has high credibility for 2025, while Deadline is similar, and SortirAParis is lower. Other sources like IndieWire are less relevant. Typically, selections are announced 4-6 weeks before the festival in mid-May, which narrows the window to April 9-17 for 2026's announcements. If April 10, 2026, is a Friday, then the press conference could occur the previous Thursday, April 9. That aligns with the 2025 pattern as well.**Identifying announcement patterns**

If the preference is for Thursdays, then 2026 might see the selection announced on April 9, which would work. From past patterns, press conferences have consistently fallen on Thursdays in mid-April for years, which is intriguing! If they stick to this Thursday schedule and the usual lead time of about 5 weeks, then April 9 or 16 would be likely. Since 2025 was also April 10, I think April 9 is quite possible, possibly raising the probability above 50%. I need to confirm the Cannes festival dates for 2026, which should be around May 12-23.**Clarifying festival timeline**

If the Cannes festival starts on May 12, 2026, which is a Tuesday, then 5 weeks prior would be early April. Specifically, April 9 is 33 days before May 12, which is slightly less than the usual 5-week lead time. However, previous festivals had announcements around 33-37 days before the event, so April 9 seems plausible. The festival tends to start on Tuesdays in mid-May, fitting the pattern. Thus, the announcement could likely be on Thursday, April 9, to keep that timeline.**Estimating Cannes announcement probability**

To satisfy the requirement of an announcement before April 10, the probability might rely more on calendar patterns than policy. Given past data, if Cannes starts on May 12, 2026, then an announcement on April 9 is quite plausible because it aligns with the historical lead time of 33 days before the festival. While identifying a shift in earlier announcements, the chance could be around 67.4%. The consistent Thursday announcement pattern adds to this likelihood. Overall, it seems likely we'll see the announcement on April 9.
