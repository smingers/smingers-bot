Analysis:

1. Paraphrased question & resolution criteria (≤30 words)  
“Will Cannes post a press release with the full 2026 ‘Official Selection’ on its own website dated before 10 April 2026 (UTC)?”  

2. Source analysis (quality, factual take-aways)  
• ScreenDaily 19 Mar 2025 & Deadline 19 Mar 2025 – trade papers citing an official Cannes communiqué: 2025 line-up press conference set for 10 Apr 2025. High quality, factual.  
• ScreenDaily 11 Apr 2024 – reports 2024 line-up unveiled 11 Apr 2024. High quality.  
• Le Monde 10 Apr 2025 – confirms announcement occurred 10 Apr 2025. High quality.  
• Historical table (2014-2023, mixed sources) – shows announcements almost always on a Thursday between 11-18 Apr except pandemic years. Medium quality; still useful trend data.  
• Numéro 16 Feb 2026, Variety rumours, assorted AskNews stories (Feb 2026) – confirm no 2026 line-up yet; contain no timing information. Low value for timing but corroborate that nothing has been announced as of 24 Feb 2026.  
No other retrieved item establishes (or even speculates on) the 2026 announcement date.

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence  
A. Structural pattern: press conference 33 days before festival opening for both 2024 & 2025.  
B. Week-day preference: every normal-year announcement since 2017 fell on a Thursday.  

Moderate evidence  
C. Festival opens two days earlier in 2026 (12 May vs 14 May 2024). Keeping the 33-day gap places the press conference on Thu 9 Apr 2026 – one day inside the “Yes” window.  
D. Cannes tends to maintain tight logistical routines (venue, Paris morning presser, simultaneous web post).  

Weak evidence  
E. Possible one-off slippage for travel, politics, strikes, etc. Historically ±2 days variability exists.  
F. Absence of any rumour about the 2026 presser date so far (§ Feb 2026) leaves uncertainty.

4. Timeframe analysis  
• 45 days until the 10 Apr deadline.  
• If the horizon were halved (≈22 days) with still no date announced, probability would fall ~10 pts (to mid-50s) because very early April would then be the only path to “Yes.”  
• If the horizon were doubled, added slack would not matter; probability barely changes because pattern is tightly coupled to festival start date.

5. Justification / inside-view update  
Outside-view base rate (strictly <10 Apr) from 2014-2025 = 1/10 ≈ 10%. However, that statistic hides how the cut-off has crept earlier:  
2018 Apr 12, 2019 Apr 18, 2022 Apr 14, 2023 Apr 13, 2024 Apr 11, 2025 Apr 10. Linear drift ≈ ~1 day earlier every year since 2022. Extending that trend by one day lands exactly on 9 Apr 2026.  

The festival’s fixed 33-day lead time (A) + Thursday preference (B) + earlier festival start (C) together form a strong structural mechanism—hard to change at short notice—pushing the 2026 presser to Thu 9 Apr 2026.  

Counter-considerations: a slip to Fri 10 Apr (still a “No”) or Mon 13 Apr (bigger slip) is plausible; the range of variation historically is ±2 days. Labour action, late internal wrangling, or desire for Friday coverage could push to the 10th. These account for the remaining 30-35% “No” probability.  

6. Most influential evidence (≤20 words each)  
• 2024 announcement: Thu 11 Apr, 33 days pre-festival.  
• 2025 announcement: Thu 10 Apr, 33 days pre-festival.  
• 2026 festival opens Tue 12 May, implying Thu 9 Apr for identical 33-day gap.  
• Cannes habitually schedules Thursday Paris pressers.  
• Historical ±2 day variance still allows slip to Fri 10 Apr or later.

7. Blind-spot scenario  
Unexpected security/political event in Paris forces postponement to the following week; “No” resolves despite the planning logic. Estimated 8 % likelihood.

8. Status-quo bias check  
Status-quo (last two years) straddles the threshold; sticking literally to 10 Apr would be a “No.” Recognising the one-day systematic drift corrects for mechanical status-quo anchoring.

Consistency line  
“66 out of 100 times, Cannes will publish the 2026 Official Selection before 10 Apr 2026.”

Probability calibration:
Final inside-view probability that Cannes releases its 2026 official selection before 10 April 2026 = 66 %.  
(Outside view 42 % → +24 pts upward after structural timetable analysis.)
