**Evaluating announcement probabilities**

I need to craft a forecasting analysis based on the likelihood of an announcement date. We previously estimated a 41.8% probability of a publication before April 10. Currently, there haven't been updates from Cannes, and the historical pattern suggests announcements happen between April 10-15. Given the festival runs from May 12-23, 2026, this could indeed shift the timeline to possibly April 8-9 for the press conference, considering past announcements. So, it looks like we need to weigh these historical factors carefully.**Analyzing announcement probabilities**

I’m noticing a pattern: announcements tend to happen 33 days before the festival starts. For the 2026 festival on May 12, that places the predicted announcement on April 9, which is a Thursday. This pattern is consistent historically. There's a strong likelihood of an announcement with a probability of about 66%-70%. While there could be variables like scheduling conflicts, the absence of contradictory information supports this estimate. I need to format the analysis sections and gather evidence from relevant sources next.**Structuring the analysis**

I'm organizing a step-by-step approach for the analysis section. First, I’ll conduct a source analysis, focusing on key materials like ScreenDaily from March 19, 2025, and others that directly impact our findings. Since summarizing all sources can be tedious, I'll create a bullet list of relevant insights. Next, I'll weigh the evidence, analyze timeframes, and provide justifications. Lastly, I’ll calibrate the probability, marking it around 68%. Let’s ensure everything is clearly outlined and concise!
