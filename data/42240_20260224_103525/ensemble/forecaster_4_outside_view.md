Analysis:  

(a) Source analysis  
1. Screen International, 19 Mar 2025 – Straight news wire confirming the 2025 press-conference date (10 Apr 2025).  Credible trade publication; information is factual (date, venue, festival executives).  
2. Deadline, 19 Mar 2025 – Same information as (1) from another reputable Hollywood trade.  Factual.  
3. Sortir à Paris roundup, 10 Apr 2025 – Reports what was announced.  Secondary but factual; no opinions relevant to timing.  
4. Le Monde, 10 Apr 2025 – French newspaper covering the 2025 announcement.  High-quality primary reporting; confirms date.  
5. Indiewire “predictions” piece (2025) – Pure speculation about film titles, no bearing on announcement timing.  
6. Screen International, 11 Apr 2024 – Confirms 2024 announcement occurred 11 Apr 2024.  Reliable.  
7. Agent report (compiled from contemporaneous press releases 2014-2025) – Collates official-selection announcement dates.  The underlying facts can be cross-checked; conclusion (no announcement before 10 Apr in any normal year) is well supported.  
All sources are dated, factual, and largely consistent; none express mere opinion about 2026 timing.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
1. All Cannes Official-Selection announcement dates, 2014-2025 (10 “normal” editions).  
2. Announcement dates for other A-list spring festivals (Berlin, SXSW) – less relevant because their calendar slots differ.  
3. Pandemic-affected Cannes editions (2020-2021) – atypical; not suitable.  
Class 1 is the most germane: same institution, same decision makers, same May festival slot.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Today: 24 Feb 2026.  • Resolution deadline: 10 Apr 2026.  • Days remaining: 45.  
Historical pattern (normal years): announcement made 4–6 weeks before opening night.  Festival 2026 is expected 12–23 May 2026 (exact dates not yet public but historically mid-May).  That implies a likely announcement window 09–17 Apr 2026.  Over the last decade the earliest date has been exactly 10 Apr 2025; the modal window is 12–14 Apr.  The long-term drift toward slightly earlier dates averages ≈0.6 day/year, but with noise and one regression (2019).  Extending that trend one more year would nudge the expected date to roughly 9.4 Apr 2026—but would still require the festival to cross an unprecedented boundary (≤9 Apr) to resolve “Yes.”

(d) Justification  
Base rate: 0/10 normal years (2014-2019, 2022-2025) saw a pre-10 Apr announcement, giving an uninformative 0 %.  Replacing 0 with a Laplace correction (1/(n+2)) → 1/12 ≈ 8 %.  
Trend adjustment: Earliest date crept from 17 Apr (2014) to 10 Apr (2025).  If that linear drift continued exactly, 2026 might hit 9 Apr.  However, the decision is discrete (press-conference slots, media logistics) and subject to weekend constraints; the marginal benefit of going earlier than 10 Apr is small.  I estimate a 30 % chance the festival tries an earlier date (e.g., 9 Apr), and conditional on trying earlier, about a 70 % chance that earlier date actually lands before 10 Apr (because the natural earlier choices are 9 Apr or 8 Apr).  That yields 0.30 × 0.70 ≈ 0.21 added probability above the “never earlier” scenario.  Scaling by uncertainty in the drift itself (50 % confidence the drift continues) cuts this to ~10 %.  

Expert/market expectation: No public betting market exists; trade-press chatter in January-February 2026 has not yet mentioned a press-conference date.  Absence of an early announcement is itself weak evidence that the date will again be mid-April (because Cannes now pre-announces the date about three weeks in advance; we are still six weeks out).  That leans slightly toward status-quo timing.

Upset rate in comparable institutional decisions (e.g., Oscar nomination calendar shifts) is low but not zero; perhaps 5-10 % of years feature an unexpected timing change.

Combining:  
• Laplace-adjusted base 8 %  
• +2 % for continuation of earlier-and-earlier drift beyond statistical expectation  
• –1 % because the festival has already tended to stop at “earliest feasible weekday” (10 Apr 2025 was a Thursday; 2026 calendar shows 9 Apr is a Thursday as well, so slight logistical headroom remains but not much)  
Rounded integrated outside-view probability ≈ 9 %.

Outside view calibration:  
I am forecasting true probability, not hedging.  The factual base rate is 0 %, but structural drift, date-selection flexibility, and a thin history all argue for a modest tail.  Upset frequency in comparable cultural-calendar events (roughly 1 in 10) supports a high single-digit figure.  The outside view therefore clusters near 8-10 %; I choose 9 % to reflect both Laplace smoothing and the slight forward drift.

Outside View Prediction: 9 %
