Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological order, relevance to timing):
   • Agent-compiled table of Cannes “Official Selection” press-conference dates 2014-25, backed by Screen Daily, Deadline, Le Monde, etc.  All primary sources are trade papers or newspaper articles published on the day of the conferences – high reliability, purely factual.  
   • Screen Daily 11 Apr 2024 piece confirming 2024 line-up unveiled that day – high reliability, factual.  
   • Deadline 10 Apr 2025 recap of 2025 press conference – high reliability, factual.  
   • Variety, Numéro and other Feb 2026 “rumour” articles – medium reliability, clearly labelled speculation; confirm only that no line-up has yet been published.  
   • AskNews feed (24 Feb 2026) – multitude of festival-related items, none from the Cannes organisation; confirms again “not yet announced”.  

   No source offers an opinion by a Cannes insider suggesting any change to the long-standing procedure.

2. Evidence analysis (weighing):
   Strong evidence
   • Historical pattern: in 10 non-pandemic years 2014-25, the announcement has always fallen on a THURSDAY between 10 Apr and 18 Apr (10/10 = 100 %).  
   • Day-of-week rule: 9/10 of those years use the “second Thursday” of April (2016-25), the lone exception being 2019 when it slipped to the third Thursday.  
   Structural factors behind the rule (committee still chaired by Thierry Frémaux; in-person Paris press conference requiring venue & TV slots) are unchanged – hard to alter quickly.

   Moderate evidence
   • Festival dates 2026: 12-23 May.  Second-Thursday-rule implies 9 Apr 2026 (33 days lead-time, identical to median).  
   • If the date slipped one full week, the conference would be 16 Apr, comfortably after the 10 Apr cut-off.  Either scenario is plausible; nothing in the news hints at extra urgency that would force the earlier date or obstacles that would force the later one.  

   Weak evidence
   • Easter 5 Apr 2026 occurs the preceding Sunday; previous instances show Cannes is happy to schedule either side of Easter, so impact is uncertain.  
   • Digital-first / live-stream only formats could in theory make an earlier date easier, but there is no sign the festival plans to ditch the customary Paris press-room.

3. Timeframe analysis
   • Days remaining until the cut-off: 46.  
   • If that window were halved (23 days), we would already be inside mid-March and lack of a scheduled press event would start tilting harder toward “No”, probably reducing the probability by ~15 pp.  Doubling the window (92 days) would increase uncertainty only slightly.

4. Justification / inside-view update
   Outside-view base rate (strictly before 10 Apr): 0/10 ⇒ 5 % after generic uncertainty padding.  
   Inside-view upward adjustment:
      +45 pp because the “second-Thursday” algorithm (observed 8 of last 9 occasions) happens this year to fall on 9 Apr, i.e., inside the qualifying window.  This is a robust structural regularity with clear causal drivers (press-conference logistics, media cycle).  
      –5 pp for realistic chance (≈1/2) that 2026 will instead follow the “third-Thursday” variant (16 Apr) or slip for ad-hoc reasons (late film negotiations, jury finalisation).  
      +0 pp news flow (nothing unusual).  
   Net inside-view probability ≈ 45 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 45 out of 100 times, Cannes will publish its 2026 official selection before 10 Apr 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Cannes’ official web site post the 2026 “Official Selection” press release dated earlier than 10 Apr 2026?  
2. Base rate: 5 %.  
3. Consistency: “45 out of 100 times…” – matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   a. 8/9 recent years = second Thursday of April pattern.  
   b. Second Thursday 2026 falls on 9 Apr (inside window).  
   c. Same festival leadership & logistics; no reform rumours.  
   d. Historical slip to third Thursday happens roughly 1 in 5 times.  
5. Blind-spot: Cannes might pre-announce a smaller “first wave” list in late March (“teaser”) that already satisfies criteria, boosting Yes.  
6. Status-quo tilt: Absent process change, third-Thursday tradition is equally plausible – reason for keeping probability below 50 %.

Probability: 45%
