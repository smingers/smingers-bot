Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Screen Daily (Mar-19-2025) – Trade paper, factual report that Cannes 2025 press conference would occur on 10 Apr 2025. High‐quality, dated.  
2. Deadline (Mar-19-2025) – Trade paper, corroborates the 10 Apr 2025 date. High‐quality, same information.  
3. Sortir à Paris (Apr-10-2025) – Local entertainment site, factual recap of the 10 Apr 2025 conference. Medium quality but consistent.  
4. Le Monde (Apr-10-2025) – Major newspaper, factual recap; high quality.  
5. IndieWire (early-2025) – Speculation about possible titles; no data on dates. Low relevance.  
6. Screen Daily (Apr-11-2024) – Factual report that 2024 selection was unveiled on 11 Apr 2024. High quality.  
7. Agent report – Collates press-conference dates 2014-2025 from trade and newspaper archives. Gives a 12-year, year-by-year list; cites sources where available. Internal synthesis but verifiable; useful for base-rate formation.

Across all sources, the factual kernel is the calendar date of each year’s “Official Selection” press conference; none of the quoted sources contains material opinion except IndieWire’s speculation about eligible films, which is irrelevant to timing.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
• All Cannes “Official Selection” announcement dates (2014-2025, excluding pandemic anomalies 2020-21) – 10 observations.  
• Announcement dates of other A-list festivals (Venice, Berlin, Toronto). Less directly pertinent – different scheduling logic.  
• Post-pandemic Cannes only (2022-2025) – 4 observations.

The first class (all modern-era Cannes announcements excluding pandemic years) best balances sample size and direct comparability; festival leadership, May calendar slot, and 4-to-6-week lead time have been stable since 2014.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 24 Feb 2026. Resolution threshold: 10 Apr 2026. Days remaining: 46.  
Historical pattern (reference class of 10 normal years):

Announcement date distribution  
– 17 Apr 2014  
– 16 Apr 2015  
– 14 Apr 2016  
– 13 Apr 2017  
– 12 Apr 2018  
– 18 Apr 2019  
– 14 Apr 2022  
– 13 Apr 2023  
– 11 Apr 2024  
– 10 Apr 2025

Key facts:  
• 0/10 came before 10 Apr.  
• Earliest was exactly 10 Apr (once).  
• Modal window is 12-16 Apr.  
• Variance is small (σ ≈ 2.4 days).  
• Non-pandemic outliers only skew later, never earlier.

(d) Justification  
Base rate: 0 % (0/10) of modern-era years had an announcement strictly before 10 Apr.  
Trend: Incremental drift of ≈0.6 day earlier per 3-year period, probably ceiling-constrained by (i) internal viewing schedule finishing in late March, (ii) Easter holiday logistics, (iii) marketing strategy requiring a 4-5-week runway, but not demonstrably poised to leap an additional full day.  
Structural continuity: Same leadership team (Knobloch, Frémaux) and settled replacement venue (UGC Montparnasse) argue for status-quo process.  
Possible upside shocks toward an earlier date:  
• A desire to avoid a French public-holiday conflict (none in mid-April 2026).  
• Digital-first reveal replacing in-person press conference (would free scheduling) – no signals of such a change.  
• An unusually light submission pool allowing the committee to lock earlier – unknown but historically the pool grows, not shrinks.  

Upset frequency: For Cannes, process deviations are rare; only force-majeure events (COVID‐19) moved the date, and they pushed it later, not earlier. I assign a ~1 in 10 chance that 2026 breaks precedent (analogous to a sports team that has never won still occasionally winning). That 10 % is a ceiling; because the direction must be earlier, I cut it roughly in half (≈5 %) to account for the asymmetry.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 0 % empirical base rate.  
Adjustments:  
+2 % for continued gradual earlier drift (extrapolating linear trend could touch 10 Apr 2026 ≈ 0 days margin; slipping one more day is plausible but not likely).  
+2 % for generic model uncertainty/unknown procedural reforms.  
+1 % fat-tail allowance for black-swan administrative decision.  
Total upward adjustment = 5 %.  

Resulting outside-view probability = 5 %.

Given the small sample size and the fact that even a 5 % event happens once every twenty iterations, this feels appropriately calibrated.

Outside View Prediction: 5%
