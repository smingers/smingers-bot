**Analyzing event timelines**

I'm looking at crafting a thorough analysis based on specified components. This will take an outside perspective without adjusting for recent news, except for a few current unknowns. I need to summarize each source's information while evaluating quality and dates. Key dates include Cannes announcements and other major festivals, focusing on the timeframe from February 24, 2026, to April 10, 2026. I’ll also provide reasoning and consider an upset probability, possibly estimating it at a conservative 10%.**Calculating probability estimates**

I'm considering the base rate of 0%, which indicates a low probability, but there’s still a chance, so maybe around 12%. I’m thinking we might settle at an 8% estimate, emphasizing that I'm looking at an outside view without adjusting for specific insider information. Realistically, I could suggest a range of 5% to 10%. If we assume a 90% chance of tradition continuing and a 10% probability of an earlier date due to potential shifts, I think 8% is a reasonable figure to go with.
