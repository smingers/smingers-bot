You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the Cannes Film Festival publish its 2026 official selection before April 10, 2026?

Question background:
This forecasts whether Cannes releases its official selection list before April 10, 2026, which affects film marketing calendars, distribution strategy, and festival planning.

`{"format":"bot_tournament_question","info":{"hash_id":"421294556a662fa9","sheet_id":266.0}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves to yes if, before April 10, 2026, the official Cannes site publishes a press release or official post that announces the Cannes Film Festival 2026 official selection and is dated before April 10, 2026. This question resolves to no if no such official-selection announcement is published on the official Cannes site before April 10, 2026. The primary source is the Cannes press releases feed: https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-releases/

Additional fine-print:
A partial teaser without an official selection list does not count. If Cannes publishes multiple waves, the first publication that clearly constitutes an official selection announcement counts.

The press conference was held at UGC Normandie on the Champs-Élysées, presided over by Thierry Frémaux and outgoing president Gilles Jacob (his final year after 37 years).
- Screen Daily (April 16, 2014) confirmed the shorts lineup was announced the day before features: "With the Official Selection of features for the 67th Cannes Film Festival set to be revealed tomorrow (April 17)..."
- **Before April 10?** No — announced April 17.

### 2015 (68th Festival, May 13–24)

The selection included Ken Loach's *I, Daniel Blake* (Palme d'Or winner), Park Chan-wook's *The Handmaiden*, Paul Verhoeven's *Elle*, and Asghar Farhadi's *The Salesman*.
- **Before April 10?** No.

### 2017 (70th Festival, May 17–28)
- **Announcement date: ~April 13, 2017**

### 2019 (72nd Festival, May 14–25)
- **Announcement date: ~April 18, 2019**
- **Before April 10?** No.

### 2020 (73rd Festival — COVID-19 Cancellation)
- **No standard Official Selection announcement.**
- The festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A "Cannes 2020 Label" was awarded to 56 films in June 2020 that would have been selected.
- **Before April 10?** No — and no traditional Official Selection was published.
- **Reason for delay/cancellation:** Global pandemic; France's lockdown made a May festival impossible, and rescheduling to summer was ruled out due to ongoing restrictions and competition with Venice/Toronto.

### 2021 (74th Festival — COVID-delayed to July 6–17)
- **Announcement date: June 3, 2021**
- The festival was postponed from its usual May slot to July 6–17, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and France's extended lockdown measures. The Official Selection announcement followed approximately one month before the festival, consistent with the usual lead time but far later in the calendar year.
- **Before April 10?** No — announcement was in June.
- **Reason for delay:** COVID-19 pandemic; France's vaccination rollout was still underway and large gatherings were restricted through spring 2021.

### 2022 (75th Festival, May 17–28)
- **Announcement date: ~April 14, 2022**
- **Before April 10?** No.

### 2023 (76th Festival, May 16–27)
- **Announcement date: ~April 13, 2023**
- **Before April 10?** No.

### 2024 (77th Festival)
- **Announcement date: ~April 11–18, 2024**
- The Variety interview with Frémaux (published ahead of the April 10, 2025 press conference) references 2024 as a normal year with a mid-April announcement. Frémaux noted that *Anora* was seen "very late, in mid-April" during the 2024 selection process, consistent with an announcement in the second or third week of April 2024.
- **Before April 10?** No.

### 2025 (78th Festival, May 13–24)
- **Announcement date: April 10, 2025**
- Confirmed by multiple sources: Deadline (March 19, 2025) pre-announced the date: "The Cannes Film Festival will announce the Official Selection for its 78th edition...on April 10 in Paris." Hollywood Reporter (April 10, 2025) confirmed: "Cannes delegate general Thierry Frémaux and president Iris Knobloch announced this year's lineup at a press conference in Paris on Thursday morning." The press conference began at 11 a.m. local time (3 a.m. PT / 5 a.m. ET).
- The venue changed from the historic UGC Normandie on the Champs-Élysées (which closed permanently in summer 2024) to UGC Montparnasse.
- The 2025 selection included Wes Anderson's *The Phoenician Scheme*, Richard Linklater's *Nouvelle Vague*, Ari Aster's *Eddington*, Kelly Reichardt's *The Mastermind*, Jafar Panahi's *A Simple Accident*, and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning out of competition.
- **Before April 10?** No — announced *on* April 10, not before it. Under a strict "before April 10" criterion, this does not qualify.

## Years with Delayed Announcements and Reasons

**2020:** The festival was cancelled entirely due to COVID-19. No traditional Official Selection was published. Instead, a "Cannes 2020 Label" was awarded to 56 films in June 2020 that would have been selected. The cancellation was due to the pandemic making a May festival impossible, and rescheduling to summer was ruled out due to ongoing restrictions and competition with Venice/Toronto.

**2021:** The festival was postponed to July 6–17, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and France's extended lockdown. The Official Selection announcement was made on June 3, 2021 — roughly one month before the festival opened, consistent with the usual lead time but far later in the calendar year than normal. Variety additionally reported that the press conference was delayed by one week within the 2021 planning cycle due to an unusually large volume of film submissions.

---

## Structural Pattern Analysis

The data reveals a remarkably consistent structural pattern in normal (non-pandemic) years:

1. **Announcement window:** In all normal years from 2014–2025, the Official Selection was announced between **April 10 and April 18**, approximately 4–6 weeks before the festival opens in mid-to-late May.

2. **Trend toward earlier announcements:** There is a slight trend toward earlier announcements over the decade. The range has shifted from April 17–18 (2014, 2019) toward April 10–13 (2022–2025). The 2025 announcement on April 10 represents the earliest known announcement in the modern era.

3. **Venue consistency:** From at least 2014 through 2024, the press conference was held at UGC Normandie on the Champs-Élysées. In 2025, it moved to UGC Montparnasse following the permanent closure of UGC Normandie in summer 2024.

4. **Pre-announcement of the date:** Cannes now pre-announces the press conference date weeks in advance. In 2025, the date was announced on March 19 — 22 days before the April 10 press conference (Deadline, March 19, 2025).

---

## Implications for the 2026 Forecasting Question

**Historical base rate for announcement strictly before April 10: 0 out of 12 years (2014–2025), or 0%.**

The 2025 announcement on April 10 is the closest Cannes has come to the threshold, but it still does not satisfy a "before April 10" criterion under strict interpretation. The trend toward earlier announcements is real but modest — moving from April 17–18 to April 10–13 over a decade. For the 2026 question to resolve "Yes," Cannes would need to announce before April 10, breaking with its entire documented modern history.

Key considerations for 2026:
- The 2026 festival is the 79th edition, with no known structural reason to dramatically advance the announcement timeline.
- Iris Knobloch was confirmed for a second three-year term until 2027, providing leadership continuity.
- The new venue (UGC Montparnasse) is now established, removing any logistical disruption.
- The trend toward earlier announcements could theoretically push the date to April 9 or earlier, but this would require a more dramatic shift than observed in any prior year.
- No pandemic or other exceptional circumstance is currently anticipated for 2026.

The strong historical evidence supports a **"No" resolution** for the 2026 question, with the base rate of 0% for pre-April 10 announcements being the dominant factor. Even if Cannes continues its modest trend toward earlier announcements, reaching a date before April 10 would represent an unprecedented break from established practice.</Agent_report>

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
