Disagreement Analysis:

The forecasters split into two clear camps with a massive spread (4% to 66%):

**Disagreement 1: Does the "second Thursday of April" pattern predict April 9, 2026?**
- Forecasters 4 (66%) and 5 (45%) argue that Cannes has a strong structural pattern of announcing on the second Thursday of April, and in 2026 that falls on April 9 — one day before the cutoff. They treat this as a near-mechanical scheduling rule.
- Forecasters 1 (4%), 2 (9%), and 3 (4%) focus on the raw historical record: zero announcements have ever occurred strictly before April 10. They treat the "second Thursday" pattern as less reliable or don't identify it at all.
- This is the single largest driver of disagreement, accounting for ~50+ percentage points of spread.

**Disagreement 2: What is the correct base rate and how should it be constructed?**
- Forecasters 1, 2, and 3 use a base rate of 0/10-12 years (0%) with small uncertainty adjustments (3.5-9%).
- Forecasters 4 and 5 acknowledge the 0/10 raw rate but argue the structural "day-of-week + lead-time" pattern is more informative than the raw date cutoff, arriving at base rates of ~42-50% after structural analysis.
- This affects predictions by 30-60 percentage points.

**Disagreement 3: Is the 33-day lead time before festival opening a reliable predictor?**
- Forecaster 4 claims both 2024 and 2025 had exactly 33-day gaps between announcement and festival opening, and since the 2026 festival opens May 12, this points to April 9.
- Other forecasters don't verify or use this specific claim.
- If true and reliable, this would strongly support a higher probability.

Root Causes:

1. **Different factual beliefs** (verifiable): Whether the "second Thursday of April" pattern holds consistently (8/9 or 9/10 recent years), and whether the 33-day lead time is accurate for 2024 and 2025. These are checkable claims about specific historical dates and day-of-week patterns.

2. **Different weighting of evidence**: Even if the Thursday pattern is confirmed, forecasters disagree on how much weight to give a day-of-week regularity vs. the raw "never before April 10" record. This is partly judgment-based.

3. **Different factual beliefs** (verifiable): The exact dates of recent Cannes announcements (2022, 2023, 2024, 2025) and what day of the week they fell on. Forecaster 4 claims specific dates; forecasters 1-3 seem to work from vaguer historical summaries.

3. What exact dates did Cannes announce its Official Selection for each year from 2017 to 2025? For each year, please provide the day of the week, the exact date, and the number of days before the festival opening. I need to verify whether the announcement consistently falls on the second Thursday of April and whether there is a consistent ~33-day lead time before the festival opening. (Agent)
