Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1: Does the "second Thursday of April" pattern predict April 9, 2026?**

The research strongly supports forecasters 4 and 5. The agent report confirms:
- The announcement has fallen on a Thursday in every confirmed year (2019, 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025)
- The "second Thursday of April" pattern holds for 2022, 2024, and 2025 (three consecutive recent years)
- The 2019 exception (third Thursday, April 18) demonstrates the pattern can shift, but this was the only exception in recent non-COVID years
- The second Thursday of April 2026 is indeed **April 9, 2026** — one day before the resolution cutoff

**Disagreement 2: Is the 33-day lead time reliable?**

The research confirms this pattern is remarkably consistent:
- 2021: 33 days (June 3 → July 6)
- 2022: ~33 days (~April 14 → May 17)
- 2024: 33 days (April 11 → May 14)
- 2025: 33 days (April 10 → May 13)
- Exception: 2019 had only 26 days (April 18 → May 14)

With the 2026 festival opening May 12, the 33-day lead time points to **April 9, 2026** — converging with the second-Thursday method.

**Disagreement 3: What is the correct base rate?**

The raw "0/10 years before April 10" base rate used by forecasters 1-3 is factually correct but misleading. The structural analysis reveals that the reason no announcement has ever fallen before April 10 is simply that the second Thursday of April has never previously fallen before April 10 (it was April 10 in 2025, April 11 in 2024, April 14 in 2022, etc.). In 2026, the calendar alignment is uniquely favorable — the second Thursday falls on April 9 for the first time in this dataset.

Updated Analysis:

The research clearly resolves the key factual disagreements in favor of forecasters 4 and 5. Both the "second Thursday of April" pattern and the "33-day lead time" pattern independently converge on **April 9, 2026** as the most likely announcement date.

However, important uncertainty remains:

**Factors supporting YES (before April 10):**
1. Both structural methods converge on April 9, 2026
2. The pattern has been consistent for 2022-2025 (4 consecutive years)
3. Same leadership (Frémaux, Knobloch) through 2027
4. No signals of institutional change

**Factors supporting NO (on or after April 10):**
1. The 2019 exception shows the pattern can shift to the third Thursday (~20% historical rate for non-COVID years)
2. Easter 2026 falls on April 5 — the week of April 6-10 is Easter week, and Cannes might delay to avoid scheduling conflicts with Easter holidays
3. Any ad-hoc delay (late film negotiations, venue issues, political events) pushes to April 16
4. The margin is razor-thin — even a one-day slip to Friday April 10 resolves NO
5. No official pre-announcement of the press conference date has been made yet

The Easter factor is worth noting: April 9 falls on the Thursday after Easter Sunday (April 5). In France, Easter Monday (April 6) is a public holiday, and many people take the full week off. This could plausibly push the press conference to April 16 (the following Thursday). However, looking at historical data, the 2017 announcement (~April 13) fell just after Easter (April 16, 2017 was Easter), and 2014 (~April 17) was near Easter as well, so Cannes hasn't consistently avoided Easter-adjacent dates.

Weighing the evidence: The structural convergence on April 9 is strong (I'd estimate ~60-65% chance the announcement falls on April 9 specifically), but there's meaningful probability (~25-30%) it shifts to April 16, and smaller probability (~5-10%) of other dates. The weighted average of 25.6% seems too low given the clear structural evidence, but forecaster 4's 66% may be slightly high given the Easter week concern and the 2019 precedent.

I estimate approximately 50% probability, reflecting the strong structural prediction of April 9 tempered by genuine uncertainty about whether the pattern holds exactly in 2026.

Confidence: MEDIUM

Probability: 50%
