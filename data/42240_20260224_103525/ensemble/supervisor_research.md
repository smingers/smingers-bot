Query: What exact dates did Cannes announce its Official Selection for each year from 2017 to 2025? For each year, please provide the day of the week, the exact date, and the number of days before the festival opening. I need to verify whether the announcement consistently falls on the second Thursday of April and whether there is a consistent ~33-day lead time before the festival opening.

## Confirmed Data Points with Sources

### 2019 (72nd edition) — CONFIRMED
- **Announcement date: April 18, 2019**
- **Day of week:** Thursday
- **Festival opening:** May 14, 2019
- **Days before opening:** 26 days
- **Second Thursday of April 2019?** No — April 18 is the **third** Thursday of April 2019 (first Thursday = April 4; second = April 11; third = April 18)
- **Source:** Screen Daily (March 28, 2019): "The Official Selection of the Cannes Film Festival will be unveiled on April 18, the festival has confirmed."
- **Note:** 2019 is a notable exception to the "second Thursday" pattern. The announcement was one week later than the second Thursday. This may relate to the festival's later-than-usual start date (May 14 vs. the typical mid-May opening), though the lead time was only 26 days rather than 33.

### 2021 (74th edition) — CONFIRMED
- **Announcement date: June 3, 2021**
- **Day of week:** Thursday
- **Festival dates:** July 6–17, 2021
- **Days before opening:** 33 days
- **Source:** Screen Daily (June 3, 2021): "The Official Selection of the 2021 Cannes Film Festival has been announced. Festival president Pierre Lescure and general delegate Thierry Frémaux revealed the line-up at a press conference at the Normandie Cinema in Paris."
- **Note:** The festival was postponed from its original May 11–22 dates due to COVID-19. The announcement was made 33 days before the July 6 opening, maintaining the lead-time convention even in an exceptional year.

### 2024 and 2025 — Previously Confirmed
- **2024:** April 11, 2024 (Thursday, 2nd Thursday of April, 33 days before May 14 opening)
- **2025:** April 10, 2025 (Thursday, 2nd Thursday of April, 33 days before May 13 opening)

## Pattern Analysis

### Thursday Announcement Convention
The Thursday announcement pattern is **extremely consistent** across all confirmed years:
- 2019: Thursday (April 18) ✓
- 2021: Thursday (June 3) ✓
- 2022: Thursday ✓
- 2024: Thursday (April 11) ✓
- 2025: Thursday (April 10) ✓

Cannes consistently holds its official selection press conference on a **Thursday**, regardless of the month or specific date.

### "Second Thursday of April" Pattern
The second Thursday of April pattern holds for **2022, 2024, and 2025**, but **2019 is a clear exception** (third Thursday). This suggests the pattern is a tendency rather than a rigid rule. The festival appears to target the second Thursday of April in normal years, but can shift to the third Thursday when scheduling requires it.

### ~33-Day Lead Time
The 33-day lead time is remarkably consistent:
- 2021: June 3 → July 6 = **33 days** ✓
- 2022: ~April 14 → May 17 = **~33 days** ✓
- 2024: April 11 → May 14 = **33 days** ✓
- 2025: April 10 → May 13 = **33 days** ✓

**Exception:** 2019 had only a 26-day lead time (April 18 → May 14). This is the primary outlier in the dataset.

The 33-day convention appears to be the dominant pattern in recent years (2021–2025), with 2019 being an anomaly.

## 2026 Forecast Analysis

### Festival Dates
The 2026 Cannes Film Festival (79th edition) is confirmed for **May 12–23, 2026** (Source: Deadline, June 2025).

### Projected Announcement Date
Applying the two pattern-based methods:

**Method 1 — Second Thursday of April 2026:**
- April 2026 calendar: April 2 (Thu), April 9 (Thu), April 16 (Thu), April 23 (Thu)
- Second Thursday = **April 9, 2026**

**Method 2 — 33-day lead time:**
- May 12, 2026 minus 33 days = **April 9, 2026**

Both methods converge on **April 9, 2026** as the most likely announcement date.

### Resolution of the Forecasting Question
The question asks: **Will Cannes publish its 2026 official selection before April 10, 2026?**

- If the announcement falls on **April 9, 2026** (second Thursday, 33-day lead): **Resolves YES**
- If the announcement falls on **April 16, 2026** (third Thursday, 26-day lead, as in 2019): **Resolves NO**
- If the announcement falls on **April 2, 2026** (first Thursday): **Resolves YES** (unlikely)

### Probability Assessment

**Factors favoring YES (announcement before April 10):**
1. The second Thursday of April 2026 is April 9, which falls before the April 10 threshold
2. The 33-day lead time from May 12 opening points precisely to April 9
3. The pattern has been consistent in 2022, 2024, and 2025 — three consecutive recent years
4. Even in the COVID-postponed 2021, the 33-day lead time was maintained
5. The festival's May 12 opening is very close to recent years (May 13 in 2025, May 14 in 2024), suggesting similar scheduling logic

**Factors favoring NO (announcement on or after April 10):**
1. In 2019, the announcement was on the **third** Thursday (April 18), not the second — demonstrating the pattern can shift
2. In 2019, the lead time was only 26 days, not 33
3. The resolution threshold of April 10 is extremely tight — any single-week delay would push the announcement to April 16 (third Thursday), resolving NO
4. The 2019 exception shows that when the festival opens on May 14 (as in 2019 and 2024), the announcement timing can vary

**Critical observation:** In 2024, the festival also opened on May 14, and the announcement was April 11 (33 days before). In 2019, the festival opened May 14, and the announcement was April 18 (26 days before). This inconsistency for the same opening date underscores that the pattern is not perfectly deterministic.

### Base Rate Calculation
From the non-COVID years with available data (2019, 2022, 2024, 2025):
- Years where announcement was before April 10: 2022 (~April 14 — actually AFTER April 10), 2024 (April 11 — AFTER April 10), 2025 (April 10 — ON the boundary, which resolves NO per "before April 10" criteria)
- Years where announcement was before April 10: **None confirmed** from recent history

This is a crucial realization: **In 2024, the announcement was April 11 (after April 10). In 2025, the announcement was April 10 (on the boundary, which per "before April 10" would resolve NO).** Only if 2026 follows the April 9 projection does it resolve YES.

The question essentially hinges on whether 2026 follows the second-Thursday/33-day pattern precisely, given that the second Thursday happens to fall on April 9 — one day before the resolution threshold.

**Estimated probability of YES: approximately 65–70%**

The convergence of both the second-Thursday and 33-day-lead methods on April 9 is strong evidence, but the 2019 exception and the tight margin introduce meaningful uncertainty. The recent trend (2022–2025) strongly favors the second Thursday pattern, and the 2026 festival's May 12 opening date aligns perfectly with an April 9 announcement.</Agent_report>
