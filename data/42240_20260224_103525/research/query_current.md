Analysis:
The key to forecasting is learning whether Cannes organizers or reputable trade outlets (Variety, Deadline, Screen, THR, etc.) have already stated a target announcement date for the 2026 lineup. Historically the Official Selection press conference happens in the first half of April, but sometimes slips to mid-April. Any 2026 accreditation notes, interviews with festival president Iris Knobloch/Thierry Frémaux, or calendar pieces in industry press could reveal the planned date. Therefore, searches should focus on:  
• Official Cannes press releases or website pages mentioning “2026 Official Selection” or “press conference.”  
• Recent (January–February 2026) trade-press articles predicting or confirming the announcement schedule.  
• Coverage of key festival milestones (submission deadlines, accreditation opening) that often include the lineup-announcement date.
