This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves to yes if, before April 10, 2026, the official Cannes site publishes a press release or official post that announces the Cannes Film Festival 2026 official selection and is dated before April 10, 2026. This question resolves to no if no such official-selection announcement is published on the official Cannes site before April 10, 2026. The primary source is the Cannes press releases feed: https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-releases/

Additional fine-print:
A partial teaser without an official selection list does not count. If Cannes publishes multiple waves, the first publication that clearly constitutes an official selection announcement counts.

Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-24 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.
