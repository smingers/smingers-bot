Analysis:
To estimate whether the 2026 list will come out before 10 April, the most valuable outside-view data are (a) the publication dates of Cannes “Official Selection” press releases in prior years and (b) any coverage explaining why the date sometimes shifts (e.g., pandemic delays, strike disruptions). Therefore we need quick access to the official press-release URLs for 2025, 2024, 2023, etc., plus contemporary news articles noting the announcement date. Broader commentary on Cannes scheduling practices can be obtained via an Agent query that explicitly asks for a year-by-year timeline.
