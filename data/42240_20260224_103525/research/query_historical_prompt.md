This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves to yes if, before April 10, 2026, the official Cannes site publishes a press release or official post that announces the Cannes Film Festival 2026 official selection and is dated before April 10, 2026. This question resolves to no if no such official-selection announcement is published on the official Cannes site before April 10, 2026. The primary source is the Cannes press releases feed: https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-releases/

Additional fine-print:
A partial teaser without an official selection list does not count. If Cannes publishes multiple waves, the first publication that clearly constitutes an official selection announcement counts.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-24. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-24 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
