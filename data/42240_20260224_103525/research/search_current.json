The honor reflects France's deep-rooted leadership across advertising, fashion, craftsmanship, technology, culture, and business. According to LIONS CEO Simon Cook, France has a strong creative output and rich cultural heritage, with over \u20ac10 billion invested by the French government in more than 20,000 creative enterprises since 2020 and a cultural and creative industries sector generating \u20ac92 billion annually. France has consistently ranked among the top 10 global performers at the festival since its inception, placing fourth in 2024. The festival has been held in Cannes since 1984, and France\u2019s cultural spirit is deeply embedded in its identity. As part of the recognition, a series of France-themed events\u2014including showcases, celebrations, forums, and brand activations\u2014will take place during the 2026 festival. Special social events will also bring together French and global creative leaders. David Lisnard emphasized the significance of the honor, noting the longstanding historical ties between Cannes Lions and France, and highlighting France\u2019s 'France 2030' national investment plan, which prioritizes cultural content production and immersive technologies as strategic pillars. France has won 1,603 Lions awards and 39 Grand Prix since the festival began, with its first Grand Prix in 1955 and its first Lion in 1954 for a Camay soap ad. In 2025, French brand AXA led all companies with 13 awards, including three for 'AXA - Three Words' by Publicis Conseil Paris. Over 250 French creatives have served as festival judges, with 18 chairing the jury. To support emerging talent, a special initiative will allow French representatives to gift free passes to first-time attendees. The project is backed by AACC, Mairie de Cannes, Publicis, Havas, IAA, and Le Club des Directeurs Artistiques.

The film, which won the Jury Prize at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival and is Germany's official submission for the 2026 Oscar for Best International Feature, is set in a farm in northern Germany and portrays a century of female memory through trauma, echoes, and identity. The story follows four young women across different eras, whose lives intersect in the same house, where walls act as resonant chambers for memory. The film employs non-linear time, recurring gestures, and sensory storytelling to explore how the female body preserves history. Schilinski describes the film as an act of remembering, emphasizing perception, shifting perspectives, and emotional suggestion over exposition. It has received critical acclaim, earning eight European Film Award nominations and recognition at the Torino Film Festival. The film will be released in Italian cinemas on February 26, 2026, distributed by I Wonder Pictures. The clip offers a preview of a work that challenges cinematic form and invites audiences to listen as much as to watch.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 07:45 AM\nSource:[Sky](https://tg24.sky.it/spettacolo/cinema/video/2026/02/24/il-suono-di-una-caduta-film-1076950)\n\n**Raoul Peck's 'Orwell: 2+2=5' Revisits the Visionary Legacy of George Orwell in a Powerful Documentary**\nRaoul Peck's documentary 'Orwell: 2+2=5', set to premiere on February 25, 2026, at the Cannes Film Festival in the Cannes Premi\u00e8re section, explores the final months of George Orwell's life and his visionary work, particularly '1984'. Through Orwell's own writings\u2014letters, journals, and texts\u2014presented as a first-person voiceover, the film examines his deep concerns about totalitarianism, racism, social inequality, and threats to freedom. The documentary interweaves archival footage, photographs, film clips, and data to visually connect Orwell\u2019s ideas with contemporary realities. It highlights Orwell\u2019s belief that 'to hate totalitarianism, you must experience it firsthand,' referencing his time in colonial Burma. The film underscores how Orwell\u2019s concepts\u2014such as 'doublethink,' 'newspeak,' 'Big Brother,' and 'thoughtcrime'\u2014remain strikingly relevant today. Peck emphasizes that Orwell foresaw the erosion of objective truth and warns that 'to be corrupted by totalitarianism, it is not necessary to live in a totalitarian state.' The film, featuring voice performances by Eric Ruf and Damian Lewis, is a 2-hour documentary produced in the United States by Le Pacte, serving as a urgent call to vigilance in the face of modern authoritarian tendencies. According to the synopsis, the film 'plunges into the last months of Orwell\u2019s life and his visionary work to explore the roots of the disturbing concepts he revealed in his dystopian masterpiece.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[Franceinfo](https://www.franceinfo.fr/culture/cinema/sorties-de-films/orwell-2-2-5-raoul-peck-revisite-l-uvre-de-l-auteur-de-1984-a-l-aune-de-notre-present-dans-un-documentaire-passionnant_7824395.html)\n\n**Seville Hosts Free Screenings of Finalist Films for the European Parliament's LUX Prize**\nSeville will host the first screening session of the five films selected as finalists for the European Parliament's LUX Prize, with the winner to be announced on April 14, 2026, at the European Parliament in Brussels.

Director Tricia Tuttle, in her second edition at the helm, highlights that the festival reflects the current state of global cinema, with recurring motifs of how personal lives are shaped by broader political and social forces. The festival will award an Honorary Golden Bear to Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh, Oscar-winning for her role in 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' in 2023. Women filmmakers are prominently featured: a slight majority of selected films are directed by women, and nine of the 22 official competition entries are by female directors\u2014more than in Cannes or Venice. The opening film, 'No Good Men' by Afghan director Shahrbanoo Sadat, is her third feature and reflects the experiences of Afghan women, a story made possible only through her work. Sadat fled Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021 and now lives in Hamburg. The festival continues to struggle with attracting major American productions, as high-budget, auteur-driven films are increasingly bypassing festivals in favor of controlled, studio-led releases. Tricia Tuttle notes that such films, like 'One More Battle', 'Sinners', and 'Marty Supreme', are no longer premiering at festivals due to risks of negative reviews and loss of control. Instead, the festival emphasizes European co-productions, with films such as Joachim Trier\u2019s 'A Very Human Story'\u2014co-financed by Norway, Denmark, France, and Germany\u2014showcasing collaborative models. Streaming platforms remain largely absent; only one Netflix film, a Mexican documentary about a woman fabricating pregnancy to avoid family pressure, is featured in a parallel section, underscoring the festival\u2019s commitment to theatrical exhibition as a core value.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 04:00 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/96QG9NQ)\n\n**AI Film Festival 'WAIFF' to Launch in Kyoto, Japan in March 2026 with Ise Marie and KENTO MORI as Official Ambassadors**\nThe World AI Film Festival (WAIFF), the world's first and largest international film festival dedicated to artificial intelligence, is set to be held in Kyoto, Japan, from March 12\u201313, 2026.
