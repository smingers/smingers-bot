The selection included Ken Loach's *I, Daniel Blake* (Palme d'Or winner), Park Chan-wook's *The Handmaiden*, Paul Verhoeven's *Elle*, and Asghar Farhadi's *The Salesman*.\n- **Before April 10?** No.\n\n### 2017 (70th Festival, May 17\u201328)\n- **Announcement date: ~April 13, 2017**\n- **Before April 10?** No.\n\n### 2018 (71st Festival, May 8\u201319)\n- **Announcement date: ~April 12, 2018**\n- **Before April 10?** No.\n\n### 2019 (72nd Festival, May 14\u201325)\n- **Announcement date: ~April 18, 2019**\n- **Before April 10?** No.\n\n### 2020 (73rd Festival \u2014 COVID-19 Cancellation)\n- **No standard Official Selection announcement.**\n- The festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A \"Cannes 2020 Label\" was awarded to 56 films in June 2020 that would have been selected.\n- **Before April 10?** No \u2014 and no traditional Official Selection was published.\n- **Reason for delay/cancellation:** Global pandemic; France's lockdown made a May festival impossible, and rescheduling to summer was ruled out due to ongoing restrictions and competition with Venice/Toronto.\n\n### 2021 (74th Festival \u2014 COVID-delayed to July 6\u201317)\n- **Announcement date: June 3, 2021**\n- The festival was postponed from its usual May slot to July 6\u201317, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and France's extended lockdown measures. The Official Selection announcement followed approximately one month before the festival, consistent with the usual lead time but far later in the calendar year.\n- **Before April 10?** No \u2014 announcement was in June.\n- **Reason for delay:** COVID-19 pandemic; France's vaccination rollout was still underway and large gatherings were restricted through spring 2021.\n\n### 2022 (75th Festival, May 17\u201328)\n- **Announcement date: ~April 14, 2022**\n- **Before April 10?** No.\n\n### 2023 (76th Festival, May 16\u201327)\n- **Announcement date: ~April 13, 2023**\n- **Before April 10?** No.\n\n### 2024 (77th Festival)\n- **Announcement date: ~April 11\u201318, 2024**\n- The Variety interview with Fr\u00e9maux (published ahead of the April 10, 2025 press conference) references 2024 as a normal year with a mid-April announcement. Fr\u00e9maux noted that *Anora* was seen \"very late, in mid-April\" during the 2024 selection process, consistent with an announcement in the second or third week of April 2024.\n- **Before April 10?** No.\n\n### 2025 (78th Festival, May 13\u201324)\n- **Announcement date: April 10, 2025**\n- Confirmed by multiple sources: Deadline (March 19, 2025) pre-announced the date: \"The Cannes Film Festival will announce the Official Selection for its 78th edition...on April 10 in Paris.\" Hollywood Reporter (April 10, 2025) confirmed: \"Cannes delegate general Thierry Fr\u00e9maux and president Iris Knobloch announced this year's lineup at a press conference in Paris on Thursday morning.\" The press conference began at 11 a.m. local time (3 a.m. PT / 5 a.m. ET).\n- The venue changed from the historic UGC Normandie on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es (which closed permanently in summer 2024) to UGC Montparnasse.\n- The 2025 selection included Wes Anderson's *The Phoenician Scheme*, Richard Linklater's *Nouvelle Vague*, Ari Aster's *Eddington*, Kelly Reichardt's *The Mastermind*, Jafar Panahi's *A Simple Accident*, and Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning out of competition.\n- **Before April 10?** No \u2014 announced *on* April 10, not before it. Under a strict \"before April 10\" criterion, this does not qualify.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Year | Announcement Date | Before April 10? | Notes |\n|------|------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| 2014 | April 17, 2014 | No | Confirmed; UGC Normandie; Gilles Jacob's final year |\n| 2015 | ~April 16, 2015 | No | Pierre Lescure's first year as president |\n| 2016 | ~April 14, 2016 | No | Normal year |\n| 2017 | ~April 13, 2017 | No | Normal year |\n| 2018 | ~April 12, 2018 | No | Normal year |\n| 2019 | ~April 18, 2019 | No | Normal year |\n| 2020 | No standard announcement (June 2020 label) | No | COVID-19 cancellation |\n| 2021 | June 3, 2021 | No | COVID-19 delay; festival moved to July |\n| 2022 | ~April 14, 2022 | No | Normal year |\n| 2023 | ~April 13, 2023 | No | Normal year |\n| 2024 | ~April 11\u201318, 2024 | No | Normal year |\n| 2025 | April 10, 2025 | No (on April 10) | Earliest in modern history; new venue |\n\n---\n\n## Years with Delayed Announcements and Reasons\n\n**2020:** The festival was cancelled entirely due to COVID-19. No traditional Official Selection was published. Instead, a \"Cannes 2020 Label\" was awarded to 56 films in June 2020 that would have been selected. The cancellation was due to the pandemic making a May festival impossible, and rescheduling to summer was ruled out due to ongoing restrictions and competition with Venice/Toronto.\n\n**2021:** The festival was postponed to July 6\u201317, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and France's extended lockdown. The Official Selection announcement was made on June 3, 2021 \u2014 roughly one month before the festival opened, consistent with the usual lead time but far later in the calendar year than normal. Variety additionally reported that the press conference was delayed by one week within the 2021 planning cycle due to an unusually large volume of film submissions.\n\n---\n\n## Structural Pattern Analysis\n\nThe data reveals a remarkably consistent structural pattern in normal (non-pandemic) years:\n\n1. **Announcement window:** In all normal years from 2014\u20132025, the Official Selection was announced between **April 10 and April 18**, approximately 4\u20136 weeks before the festival opens in mid-to-late May.\n\n2. **Trend toward earlier announcements:** There is a slight trend toward earlier announcements over the decade. The range has shifted from April 17\u201318 (2014, 2019) toward April 10\u201313 (2022\u20132025). The 2025 announcement on April 10 represents the earliest known announcement in the modern era.\n\n3. **Venue consistency:** From at least 2014 through 2024, the press conference was held at UGC Normandie on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. In 2025, it moved to UGC Montparnasse following the permanent closure of UGC Normandie in summer 2024.\n\n4. **Pre-announcement of the date:** Cannes now pre-announces the press conference date weeks in advance. In 2025, the date was announced on March 19 \u2014 22 days before the April 10 press conference (Deadline, March 19, 2025).\n\n---\n\n## Implications for the 2026 Forecasting Question\n\n**Historical base rate for announcement strictly before April 10: 0 out of 12 years (2014\u20132025), or 0%.**\n\nThe 2025 announcement on April 10 is the closest Cannes has come to the threshold, but it still does not satisfy a \"before April 10\" criterion under strict interpretation. The trend toward earlier announcements is real but modest \u2014 moving from April 17\u201318 to April 10\u201313 over a decade. For the 2026 question to resolve \"Yes,\" Cannes would need to announce before April 10, breaking with its entire documented modern history.\n\nKey considerations for 2026:\n- The 2026 festival is the 79th edition, with no known structural reason to dramatically advance the announcement timeline.\n- Iris Knobloch was confirmed for a second three-year term until 2027, providing leadership continuity.\n- The new venue (UGC Montparnasse) is now established, removing any logistical disruption.\n- The trend toward earlier announcements could theoretically push the date to April 9 or earlier, but this would require a more dramatic shift than observed in any prior year.\n- No pandemic or other exceptional circumstance is currently anticipated for 2026.\n\nThe strong historical evidence supports a **\"No\" resolution** for the 2026 question, with the base rate of 0% for pre-April 10 announcements being the dominant factor. Even if Cannes continues its modest trend toward earlier announcements, reaching a date before April 10 would represent an unprecedented break from established practice.</Agent_report>\n"
