Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**AskNews - China Box Office Articles (Feb 23-24, 2026)**: Multiple Chinese sources (CCTV, Phoenix News, Maoyan data) confirm China's 2026 box office has reached ~8 billion yuan (~$1.1B USD) as of Feb 23. These are factual market reports. Key finding: "Fast & Furious 3" (Chinese domestic film, not the Hollywood franchise) leads with 2.8 billion yuan (~$385M USD). These are Chinese domestic films that would NOT appear on Box Office Mojo's worldwide 2026 page as Hollywood releases. High reliability for Chinese market data, but these films are domestic Chinese productions unlikely to be tracked on BOM's worldwide page in the same way.

**ScreenRant (Jan 28, 2026)**: Projects 10 films could reach $1B in 2026, including Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3). Opinion/analysis piece but cites industry context. Moderate reliability - entertainment journalism.

**ScreenRant (Dec 18, 2025)**: Cites Gower Street Analytics (credible industry forecaster) projecting $35B global box office for 2026. Lists Super Mario Galaxy Movie as April 3 release. Moderate-high reliability for the analytical framework.

**Comicbook (Jan 18, 2026)**: Gives specific probability estimates for 4 films crossing $1B - notably all are summer/fall releases (Mandalorian, Toy Story 5, Spider-Man, Avengers: Doomsday). None are before May 1. The article implicitly suggests no pre-May film is expected to cross $1B except possibly Super Mario. Moderate reliability.

**Comicbook (Jan 25, 2026)**: 2027 projections article, mentions 2025 had 4 films cross $1B. Confirms Avatar: Fire and Ash crossed $1B in January 2026 (as a 2025 release). This is crucial - Avatar's 2026 earnings would be on BOM's 2026 page, but the film started in 2025.

**Koimoi (Feb 22, 2026)**: Analysis of "Michael" (Michael Jackson biopic, April 24 release) as potential first 2026 $1B film. Trailer got 116M views in 24 hours. Entertainment outlet, not expert financial analysis. Weak-moderate reliability. April 24 release gives only ~7 days before May 1 - extremely tight for $1B.

**FirstShowing.net (release schedule)**: Confirms Super Mario Galaxy Movie for April 3 (or April/May boundary area - ambiguous). Also lists Pixar's Hoppers for March/April. Reliable for release dates.

**CNBC (Jan 30, 2026)**: Industry analysis noting franchise performance struggles. Avatar: Fire and Ash passed $1B internationally but "significantly underperformed vs. predecessors." Wicked: For Good underperformed. This is a credible source noting franchise fatigue risks. High reliability.

**Hollywood Reporter (Jan 31, 2026)**: Box office report showing modest openings ($16-18M for top films). No film near $1B trajectory in late January. High reliability for current box office state.

**Vandal/Spanish source (Jan 1, 2026)**: Lists 5 summer films capable of $1B, all after May 1. Confirms no pre-May films expected to break records except possibly Super Mario. Moderate reliability.

**Exame/German sources (Dec 2025)**: Historical context on $1B films. 57 films total have crossed $1B. Zootopia 2 crossed $1B in Dec 2025. Reliable historical data.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **Super Mario Galaxy Movie releases April 3, 2026** (confirmed by multiple sources including FirstShowing, ScreenRant, Gower Street Analytics). The original Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) crossed $1B in ~21 days from April 5 release. This gives the sequel ~28 days before May 1. Direct historical parallel with strong predictive power. *Strongly favors Yes.*

2. **Multiple credible industry forecasters project Super Mario Galaxy Movie for $1B+** (Gower Street Analytics cited by ScreenRant, Variety described as "sure thing," IndieWire as "near lock"). Multiple independent sources converging. *Strongly favors Yes.*

3. **CNBC article (Jan 30, 2026) documents franchise underperformance trend**: Wicked: For Good underperformed, Avatar: Fire and Ash "significantly underperformed vs. predecessors." This is a real structural risk. *Moderately favors No.*

4. **No film in Jan-March 2026 is on a $1B trajectory**: Hollywood Reporter confirms modest openings in late January. The release schedule shows no major blockbuster between now and April 3. *Neutral - consistent with the April 3 film being the key candidate.*

**Moderate Evidence:**

5. **"Michael" (April 24) has 116M trailer views in 24 hours** (Koimoi, Feb 22, 2026). Even if it's a massive hit, April 24 + 7 days before May 1 makes $1B essentially impossible in the resolution window. *Slightly favors No for this specific film contributing.*

6. **Avatar: Fire and Ash crossed $1B in early January 2026** but as a 2025 release, it would appear on BOM's 2025 page, not 2026. *Neutral for resolution.*

7. **Chinese domestic films performing strongly** (Spring Festival box office 8B yuan) but these are domestic Chinese productions, not Hollywood films tracked on BOM's worldwide 2026 page in the standard way. *Slightly favors No for resolution via this path.*

**Weak Evidence:**

8. **2026 projected to be biggest box office year of the 2020s** (Gower Street Analytics). General positive sentiment. *Weakly favors Yes.*

9. **Franchise fatigue concerns** from CNBC experts. *Weakly favors No.*

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Resolution window**: Feb 24 to May 1, 2026 = ~66 days from now.

**Key event**: Super Mario Galaxy Movie releases April 3, giving ~28 days of box office before May 1.

**If timeframe halved (to ~March 15)**: Probability drops dramatically to ~5-10%, as no major blockbuster releases before then.

**If timeframe doubled (to ~July 1)**: Probability approaches ~95%+, as multiple summer blockbusters (Toy Story 5, Mandalorian, Spider-Man) would be in play.

The current timeframe is essentially a binary bet on whether Super Mario Galaxy Movie (1) is released on April 3 as scheduled, (2) is a $1B+ hit, and (3) reaches $1B within ~28 days. The original did it in 21 days, so the timeline is feasible.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate**: ~78% from outside view analysis.

**Adjustments from inside view:**

*Upward factors:*
- The original Super Mario Bros. Movie's trajectory (crossed $1B in 21 days from April 5, 2023) provides a direct, highly relevant precedent. 28 days is comfortable margin.
- Multiple credible forecasters (Gower Street Analytics, Variety, IndieWire) specifically identify this film as a $1B+ candidate.
- No competing blockbusters in early April based on release schedule.
- Easter holiday timing (April 3 is Good Friday weekend in many markets) boosts opening weekend.

*Downward factors:*
- CNBC documents a real trend of franchise underperformance in 2025-2026 (Wicked: For Good, Avatar: Fire and Ash both underperformed).
- The question requires the gross to appear on BOM's **2026 worldwide page** - this is a specific technical requirement. The original's 2026 earnings would be on the 2026 page, so this is fine for Super Mario Galaxy.
- Sequels to animated films sometimes underperform originals (though the original was exceptional).
- Release date uncertainty - FirstShowing notes "April/May boundary area" for Super Mario Galaxy, which could mean a late April release that doesn't leave enough time.

**Critical uncertainty**: The release date. If Super Mario Galaxy Movie releases April 3 as most sources indicate, the probability is high (~80%). If it releases April 24 or later, the probability drops significantly. The Koimoi article about "Michael" releasing April 24 and being the "first 2026 billion-dollar film" suggests the author doesn't expect Super Mario to do it - but this is a weak signal from a non-expert source.

**Checking BOM resolution criteria**: The question requires films with "worldwide box office gross of at least US$1,000,000,000 earned in 2026" on BOM's 2026 page. This means only 2026 earnings count. Avatar: Fire and Ash (2025 release) would have its 2026 earnings on the 2026 page, but it started in December 2025 and its total 2026 earnings would be a fraction of its total gross. As of early January 2026, it had crossed $1B total but most of that was in 2025. Its 2026-only earnings would be much less than $1B. So Avatar doesn't help here.

The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is the clear primary candidate. The probability essentially reduces to:
- P(film releases by ~April 3 as scheduled) × P(film is a $1B+ global hit) × P(it crosses $1B within 28 days | it's a $1B+ hit)
- ≈ 0.90 × 0.78 × 0.88 ≈ 0.62

Wait, let me reconsider. The "releases by April 3" probability - all major sources confirm April 3. The risk of delay is low (~5-10%). Let me also reconsider P(film is $1B+ hit) - the franchise is proven, the original crossed $1.36B, multiple analysts forecast $1B+. I'd put this at ~75-80%. P(crosses $1B within 28 days | $1B+ hit) - original did it in 21 days, so ~90%.

Combined: 0.92 × 0.78 × 0.90 ≈ 0.645

Plus small probability from other films (~3-5%):
Total ≈ 0.645 + 0.03 = ~0.675

Hmm, this is slightly lower than my outside view of 78%. The discrepancy comes from being more explicit about the conditional probabilities. Let me reconsider P(film is $1B+ hit):

The original grossed $1.36B. Sequels to animated films that crossed $1B: Frozen 2 ($1.45B), Incredibles 2 ($1.24B), Finding Dory ($1.03B), Toy Story 4 ($1.07B) - all crossed $1B. The base rate for sequels to $1B+ animated films crossing $1B is very high (~80-90%). The franchise fatigue trend is a real risk but this is a particularly beloved franchise.

Revised: P($1B+ hit) ≈ 80%

Combined: 0.92 × 0.80 × 0.90 ≈ 0.66

Plus other films: ~0.03-0.05

Total: ~0.69-0.71

I'll settle on approximately **72%** as my inside view prediction, slightly below the outside view of 78%, reflecting the explicit conditional probability analysis and the documented franchise underperformance trend in 2025-2026.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view was 78%. The inside view analysis, being more explicit about conditional probabilities, suggests ~70-72%. The franchise underperformance trend documented by CNBC is a real risk, but the Super Mario franchise has demonstrated exceptional resilience. The 28-day window is comfortable given the original's 21-day trajectory.

I'll set my final prediction at **73%**.

## Checklist

1. **Resolution criteria**: At least one film earns $1B+ worldwide in 2026 (per BOM 2026 page) before May 1, 2026. ✓ My analysis focuses on 2026-earned gross, not cumulative totals including 2025 earnings.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 78% (specific candidate with strong precedent). My inside view of 73% is a modest downward revision reflecting explicit conditional probability analysis. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "73 out of 100 times, at least one film earns $1B+ on BOM's 2026 page before May 1, 2026 happens." This makes sense - primarily driven by Super Mario Galaxy Movie's April 3 release. ✓

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - Super Mario Galaxy Movie releases April 3, original crossed $1B in 21 days (strong, verified)
   - Multiple credible forecasters project $1B+ for sequel (strong, multiple sources)
   - Franchise underperformance trend in 2025-2026 (moderate, CNBC with named experts)
   - 28-day window is comfortable but not guaranteed (moderate, historical data)
   - No other pre-May film has realistic $1B path (strong, release schedule confirms)

5. **Blind spot**: Super Mario Galaxy Movie underperforms significantly (e.g., 40-50% below original) due to franchise fatigue, poor reviews, or competition from a surprise hit, failing to reach $1B before May 1. This would shift probability to ~10-15%. Probability of this scenario: ~20-25%.

6. **Status quo**: No film has crossed $1B yet in 2026 (as of Feb 24). The status quo is "No" - but the April 3 release fundamentally changes the calculus. The world doesn't stay static here.

Probability: 73%
