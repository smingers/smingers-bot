Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Box Office Mojo (2026 data snapshot)**: Factual, primary source. As of the snapshot (early 2026, around Feb 24), the top film is Wuthering Heights at ~$152M. No film has reached $1B yet. High reliability for current state.

2. **Screen Rant (Jan 31, 2026 - Super Mario Galaxy)**: Opinion piece from a staff writer, not an independent analyst. The author reversed their prediction after seeing a trailer. Low analytical rigor, but reflects general industry sentiment. The factual content (original grossed $1.36B, sequel releases April 1/3, 2026) is reliable.

3. **Rotten Tomatoes Most Anticipated 2026**: Informational list of releases. Notes no January-March film is a likely $1B candidate. Reliable for release schedule information.

4. **IMDb Calendar**: Factual release schedule data. Confirms Super Mario Galaxy Movie for April 1, 2026. High reliability for dates.

5. **Hollywood Reporter 2026 Movies**: Lists major releases; references Barbie's $1B as benchmark. Reliable for release information.

6. **NBC News (Jan 4, 2026 - Avatar crossing $1B)**: **Critical factual finding**: Avatar: Fire and Ash crossed $1B worldwide in early January 2026, and Zootopia 2 had already crossed $1.59B. However, these films began their runs in late 2025, so they would count toward 2025's box office totals on Box Office Mojo, NOT 2026. The resolution criteria specifically requires "worldwide box office gross of at least US$1,000,000,000 earned in 2026" as listed on Box Office Mojo's 2026 page. This is a crucial distinction.

7. **Screen Rant (Dec 18, 2025 - 2026 projections)**: Gower Street Analytics projects $35B for 2026 full year. Identifies Super Mario Galaxy Movie as major early 2026 title. Moderate reliability (industry analyst cited).

8. **Variety 2026 predictions**: Identifies Super Mario Galaxy Movie as a "sure thing" for ~$1B, comparable to the original. Variety is a credible industry publication. Reliable for industry sentiment.

9. **Agent Report**: Comprehensive aggregation. Key facts: IndieWire lists Super Mario Galaxy as "near lock" for $1B; UpcomingOnScreen forecasts $1.5B; original crossed $1B in ~3 weeks; April 3 release gives ~4 weeks before May 1 deadline. Multiple sources converge on this assessment. The agent report synthesizes well but includes some unverified claims from less authoritative sources.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes apply:

- **"Will any film cross $1B in the first 4 months of a calendar year?"**: Historically rare. Most $1B films release in summer or holiday season. However, The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) released April 5 and crossed $1B by late April/early May 2023. This is a direct precedent.

- **"Will a sequel to a $1B+ animated franchise film also cross $1B?"**: Strong base rate. Sequels to billion-dollar animated films (Frozen 2, Incredibles 2, Finding Dory, etc.) frequently cross $1B. This reference class supports a high probability.

- **"Will a specific anticipated blockbuster meet analyst consensus forecasts?"**: Analysts are sometimes wrong. IndieWire notes "one of those six [near-locks] will probably fall short." But the consensus is strong for this specific film.

The most suitable reference class is: **"Sequels to $1B+ animated franchise films releasing in April with 4 weeks of theatrical run before a deadline."** This is highly specific and favorable.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- The question window is Feb 24 to May 1, 2026 — approximately 66 days.
- The Super Mario Galaxy Movie releases April 3, giving it ~28 days of box office accumulation before May 1.
- The original Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) crossed $1B in approximately 3 weeks (21 days) from its April 5, 2023 release.
- Historical pattern: Films that ultimately cross $1B typically do so within 3-5 weeks of release if they're going to do so at all, as opening weekends and the first few weeks drive the majority of theatrical revenue.
- This timeline is tight but feasible based on the original's trajectory.

**(d) Justification**

The key question is whether the Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3) can cross $1B before May 1 (~28 days). The evidence strongly supports this:

1. The original crossed $1B in ~3 weeks — the sequel has ~4 weeks.
2. Multiple credible industry sources (Variety, IndieWire, UpcomingOnScreen) forecast $1B+ for the sequel.
3. The franchise has proven IP, Easter holiday timing, and no major competing blockbusters in early April.
4. The sequel appears more ambitious (Galaxy is a beloved game title, adds Yoshi, etc.).

Key risks:
- Critical failure (unlikely given franchise strength, but possible)
- Weaker-than-expected opening (China underperformed for the original)
- The timeline is tight — if the film opens slightly below the original's pace, it might not reach $1B until after May 1
- No other film in Jan-March has a realistic path to $1B

The NBC News article confirms Avatar: Fire and Ash and Zootopia 2 crossed $1B in early 2026, but these were 2025 releases and would appear on Box Office Mojo's 2025 page, not 2026. The resolution criteria requires 2026-earned gross on the 2026 BOM page.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for "a film crossing $1B in the first 4 months of a year" is historically low (~10-20% in most years), but this year has a specific, high-probability candidate (Super Mario Galaxy Movie) that changes the calculus dramatically.

The specific probability hinges on:
- P(Super Mario Galaxy Movie crosses $1B before May 1) ≈ 70-80%
  - P(film is a $1B+ hit overall) ≈ 80-85% (strong consensus, proven IP)
  - P(it does so within 28 days | it's a $1B+ hit) ≈ 85-90% (original did it in 21 days)
  - Combined: ~70-75%
- P(another film crosses $1B before May 1 | Super Mario doesn't) ≈ 5-10%

Combined probability: ~72-78%

However, I should also consider that the original Super Mario Bros. Movie's opening weekend was $204M globally, and it crossed $1B in 21 days. If the sequel performs similarly or better, 28 days is very comfortable. The main risk is a significant underperformance (say, 50% below original), which would push the $1B crossing past May 1 or not happen at all.

Given the strong analyst consensus and the favorable timeline, I'll set the probability at approximately 78%.

78%
