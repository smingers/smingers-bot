Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **AskNews articles on China's 2026 Spring Festival box office** (multiple Chinese sources, Feb 23-24, 2026) – High quality, factual, contemporaneous. Key fact: "Fast & Furious 3" (Chinese domestic title, not the Hollywood franchise) earned ~2.8 billion yuan (~$385M) during Spring Festival. These are domestic Chinese films, not Hollywood releases. China's total 2026 box office reached ~8 billion yuan (~$1.1B) by Feb 23, but this is the aggregate market, not a single film. No single film has crossed $1B worldwide.

2. **ScreenRant "2026 Could Be The Biggest Year Ever"** (Jan 28, 2026) – Entertainment journalism, moderate quality. Lists 10 films projected to reach $1B in 2026, but ALL are summer/fall/winter releases (Avengers: Doomsday, Toy Story 5, Spider-Man, Mandalorian, etc.). The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3) is the only pre-May candidate listed. Opinion-based, not expert financial analysis.

3. **ScreenRant "2026 Global Box Office Projections"** (Dec 18, 2025) – Cites Gower Street Analytics (identifiable expert firm) projecting $35B globally for 2026. Lists The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3) as the first major release. Moderate-strong quality for the Gower Street citation.

4. **Koimoi "Michael Could Become 2026's First Billion-Dollar Film"** (Feb 22, 2026) – Entertainment outlet, low-moderate quality. Notes *Michael* (April 24) has 116M trailer views in 24 hours (Billboard-cited fact). Analysts unnamed. Weak evidence for $1B prediction.

5. **CNBC article on franchise box office struggles** (Jan 30, 2026) – Reputable financial news outlet. Key facts: domestic box office still ~23% below 2019 levels; franchise films underperforming (Wicked: For Good ~$525M global, Avatar: Fire and Ash ~$1B but underperformed vs predecessors). Moderate-strong quality, cautionary signal.

6. **ComicBook "4 2026 Blockbusters"** (Jan 18, 2026) – Entertainment journalism, low-moderate quality. Identifies Mandalorian, Toy Story 5, Spider-Man, Avengers as most likely $1B films – all post-May releases. No pre-May candidates given high probability.

7. **Hollywood Reporter box office report** (Jan 31, 2026) – Trade publication, high quality for factual data. Shows modest January openings ($16-18M range), no film near $1B trajectory.

8. **FirstShowing.net 2026 schedule** – Factual release calendar. Confirms The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3) and *Michael* (April 24) as the only major pre-May wide releases with $1B potential.

9. **ComicBook "2027 Could Break Record"** (Jan 25, 2026) – Notes Avatar: Fire and Ash crossed $1B in January 2026 but as a 2025 release. Confirms 2025 had 4 films reach $1B total (Ne Zha 2, Zootopia 2, Lilo & Stitch, Avatar: Fire and Ash).

10. **Vandal/Spanish article on 2026 summer** (Jan 1, 2026) – Identifies 5 summer films capable of $1B, all post-May. Confirms no pre-May blockbusters in their analysis.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie releases April 3, 2026** – confirmed by multiple sources (FirstShowing, ScreenRant, Gower Street Analytics). The original Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) grossed $1.36B worldwide. A sequel with similar franchise momentum has a strong historical precedent. This is the single most important factor. The question is whether it can reach $1B before May 1 (28 days after release). The 2023 original crossed $1B in approximately 26 days. This is a direct historical parallel with strong predictive power.

- **Post-pandemic box office recovery is real but incomplete** – CNBC confirms domestic box office still ~23% below 2019. However, 2025 produced 4 billion-dollar films (Ne Zha 2, Zootopia 2, Lilo & Stitch, Avatar: Fire and Ash), showing the market can still produce $1B films. Moderate-strong evidence that the market supports $1B films.

- **Gower Street Analytics projects $35B globally for 2026** – Identifiable expert source. Strong lineup. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is specifically called out as a major early release.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Michael (April 24) as a secondary candidate** – 116M trailer views is notable (Billboard-cited), but biopic films rarely reach $1B (Bohemian Rhapsody ~$910M is the closest comparable). The April 24 release date gives only 7 days before May 1, making $1B essentially impossible even if it opens huge. This is NOT a viable pre-May $1B candidate.

- **No other pre-May candidates** – The release calendar shows no other mega-franchise films before May 1. Scream 7, Project Hail Mary, Pixar's Hoppers are all mid-tier in terms of $1B potential.

**Weak evidence:**
- **China's strong 2026 box office** – China's market is performing well (8B yuan by Feb 23), but this is aggregate market data. Chinese domestic films (Fast & Furious 3 Chinese title) are not Hollywood releases and wouldn't count toward a Hollywood film's worldwide gross. However, a strong Chinese market means The Super Mario Galaxy Movie could benefit from Chinese theatrical performance if it releases there.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Time remaining:** 67 days (Feb 24 to May 1, 2026).

The critical window is April 3 to May 1 = 28 days for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie to reach $1B.

- **If timeframe halved** (to ~March 17): Resolution would be essentially impossible – no major franchise film releases before then, and no current film is near $1B. Probability would drop to ~2-3%.
- **If timeframe doubled** (to ~July 1): Multiple additional blockbusters would be in play (Mandalorian May 22, Toy Story 5 June 19). Probability would rise to ~85-90%.

The current 67-day window is essentially a binary bet on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie reaching $1B in its first 28 days.

**(d) Justification**

**Key question:** Can The Super Mario Galaxy Movie reach $1B worldwide by May 1, 2026 (28 days after its April 3 release)?

**Historical parallel:** The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) opened April 5, 2023 and crossed $1B on approximately April 26, 2023 (day 21). It ultimately grossed $1.36B. This is the single most directly analogous precedent.

**Factors favoring YES:**
1. Direct sequel to a $1.36B film with strong franchise momentum
2. 28 days is sufficient time (original did it in ~21 days)
3. Global box office market recovering (2025: 4 $1B films)
4. Strong Chinese market in 2026
5. Gower Street Analytics bullish on 2026
6. No major competing blockbusters in early April window

**Factors against YES:**
1. Sequels often underperform originals (Wicked: For Good, Avatar: Fire and Ash both underperformed)
2. Domestic box office still ~23% below 2019 peak
3. Franchise fatigue is a real concern
4. Only one viable candidate – if Mario underperforms, no backup
5. International release timing uncertainty (China release not confirmed)
6. The CNBC article specifically notes franchise films are increasingly risky

**Calibration:**
- Base rate from reference class (major franchise film in pre-May window): ~57% (from outside view)
- Adjustment for single candidate (no backup): -8%
- Adjustment for strong direct precedent (2023 Mario): +10%
- Adjustment for sequel underperformance trend: -8%
- Adjustment for 28-day window being sufficient (historically): +3%
- Net: ~54%

The outside view of 42% was based on a broader reference class. Given the very specific precedent of the 2023 Mario film crossing $1B in 21 days, and this being a direct sequel, I should weight this more heavily. However, the sequel underperformance trend is real and documented.

**Probability Calibration**

The question essentially resolves to: "Will The Super Mario Galaxy Movie gross $1B worldwide in its first 28 days?"

- The 2023 original did it in ~21 days
- Sequels to $1B+ animated films have mixed records: Incredibles 2 ($1.24B, exceeded original), Finding Dory ($1.03B, below original), Toy Story 4 ($1.07B), Frozen 2 ($1.45B exceeded original)
- Several animated sequels DID cross $1B; the question is whether this one will do it fast enough
- The market is somewhat weaker than 2023 but not dramatically so
- 28 days is a comfortable window if the film performs at or near the original's level

I'll set my inside view at approximately **62%**, slightly above the adjusted base rate, reflecting the strong direct precedent of the 2023 film and the adequate time window, while acknowledging sequel risk and the single-candidate nature of the bet.

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria:** At least one 2026 film must show ≥$1B worldwide on Box Office Mojo before May 1, 2026. My analysis focuses on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3) as the only viable candidate. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate:** 42% (reference class: major franchise film in pre-May window, historical hit rate ~57%, adjusted down for single candidate and other factors). My inside view of 62% reflects the strong specific precedent of the 2023 Mario film. This is a meaningful upward shift justified by the direct historical analog. ✓

3. **Consistency check:** "62 out of 100 times, at least one 2026 film grosses $1B worldwide before May 1, 2026." This is plausible given the Super Mario Galaxy Movie's April 3 release and its predecessor's 21-day $1B timeline. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - The 2023 Super Mario Bros. Movie crossed $1B in ~21 days (strong, directly analogous precedent) ✓
   - The Super Mario Galaxy Movie releases April 3, giving 28 days before deadline ✓
   - Sequels frequently underperform originals (CNBC, multiple sources) ✓
   - No other pre-May $1B candidates exist ✓
   - Post-pandemic box office still ~23% below 2019 (CNBC) ✓

5. **Blind spot:** The scenario most likely to make this forecast look silly: The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is delayed past May 1, or China doesn't release it before May 1, or it opens to a massive flop (like $60M domestic opening). Any of these would push probability to near-zero and make a 62% forecast look overconfident.

6. **Status quo:** Currently no 2026 film is near $1B. The status quo is "No" until April 3. The question is whether a single film can change that in 28 days. The status quo slightly favors No, but the historical precedent for this specific franchise is strong enough to keep the probability above 50%.

Probability: 62%
