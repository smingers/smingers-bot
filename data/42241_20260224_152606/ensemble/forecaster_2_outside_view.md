Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Box Office Mojo (2026 data snapshot)**: Factual, primary source. As of the snapshot date (around Feb 24, 2026), the top-grossing 2026 film is Wuthering Heights at ~$152M. No 2026 film has reached $1B yet. High quality, objective data.

2. **NBC News / Avatar: Fire and Ash article (Jan 4, 2026)**: Factual news report. Avatar: Fire and Ash crossed $1B worldwide and Zootopia 2 crossed $1.59B — but critically, these films began their runs in late 2025. The question requires films earning $1B "in 2026" per Box Office Mojo's 2026 worldwide page. This is a crucial distinction: Box Office Mojo's year pages typically track films by their release year, so Avatar (released Dec 2025) and Zootopia 2 (released Nov 2025) would appear on the 2025 page, not 2026. This means these films do NOT count toward resolution.

3. **Screen Rant (Jan 31, 2026)**: Opinion piece by a Screen Rant writer (not an independent analyst). Predicts Super Mario Galaxy Movie will surpass $1.36B. Useful for sentiment but not expert analysis.

4. **Rotten Tomatoes Most Anticipated 2026**: Editorial/opinion. Notes early 2026 films are mostly mid-budget. No specific $1B predictions.

5. **IMDb Calendar**: Factual release schedule. Confirms Super Mario Galaxy Movie (Apr 1/3, 2026) as the major pre-May blockbuster.

6. **Hollywood Reporter 2026 preview**: Editorial with factual release info. Notes Super Mario Galaxy Movie and other titles.

7. **Screen Rant 2026 Box Office Projections (Dec 18, 2025)**: Cites Gower Street Analytics projecting $35B global box office for 2026. Identifies Super Mario Galaxy Movie as major early 2026 title.

8. **Variety 2026 Box Office Predictions**: Industry publication analysis. Labels Super Mario Galaxy Movie a "sure thing" with billion-dollar potential, citing the original's $1B+ performance.

9. **Agent Report**: Comprehensive synthesis. Identifies Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3) as the primary $1B candidate before May 1. Cites IndieWire listing it as a "near lock" for $1B, UpcomingOnScreen forecasting $1.5B. Notes Michael (April 24) has insufficient time window. High quality synthesis but relies on secondary sources.

**Key clarification on Avatar/Zootopia**: These 2025 releases almost certainly appear on Box Office Mojo's 2025 page, not 2026. The resolution criteria specifies "Box Office Mojo's 2026 worldwide box office page," which lists films by release year. This means the question hinges on 2026-released films only.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

- **Reference class 1: Films crossing $1B before May 1 in any given year.** Historically rare — most $1B films are summer or holiday releases. However, some exceptions exist (e.g., The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023 crossed $1B by late April). This class suggests it's possible but not guaranteed.

- **Reference class 2: Animated/family franchise sequels with predecessors crossing $1B.** The original Super Mario Bros. Movie crossed $1B in ~3 weeks. Sequels to billion-dollar animated films often perform similarly or better (e.g., Frozen 2, Incredibles 2). This is the most relevant class.

- **Reference class 3: Films releasing in early April with 4 weeks to accumulate $1B.** The original Mario movie released April 5, 2023 and crossed $1B by ~April 26. This is almost exactly the same scenario. This reference class strongly supports Yes.

The most suitable reference class is #3 — the direct predecessor's performance provides a near-perfect analog.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- The question window is Feb 24 – May 1, 2026 (~65 days).
- The Super Mario Galaxy Movie releases April 3, giving it ~28 days before the May 1 deadline.
- The original Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) crossed $1B in approximately 21 days after its April 5, 2023 release.
- Historical pattern: Films with strong opening weekends ($150M+) can reach $1B in 3-4 weeks. The original Mario movie did exactly this.
- No other January-March 2026 release appears to have realistic $1B potential in this window.

**(d) Justification**

The question essentially reduces to: Will The Super Mario Galaxy Movie cross $1B before May 1, 2026?

**Factors supporting Yes:**
- The original crossed $1B in ~21 days from a similar April release date
- Multiple credible industry sources (IndieWire, Variety, UpcomingOnScreen) forecast $1B+ for the sequel
- Easter holiday timing (April 3) is favorable for family films
- Strong IP with expanded game references (Galaxy is beloved)
- ~28 days of box office accumulation available before deadline
- Consensus among analysts is that this is a "near lock" or "sure thing" for $1B

**Factors supporting No:**
- Sequels sometimes underperform originals
- China underperformed for the original, limiting global ceiling
- Critical reception could disappoint
- IndieWire noted "one of those six [near-locks] will probably fall short"
- The film hasn't released yet; anything could happen

**Key uncertainty**: The Avatar/Zootopia situation. These 2025 films crossed $1B but appear on the 2025 BOM page, not 2026. The BOM snapshot confirms no 2026 film has crossed $1B yet. So resolution depends entirely on future 2026 releases.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for a major animated franchise sequel (with predecessor crossing $1B) to cross $1B itself is quite high — perhaps 60-70% historically. However, the additional constraint of doing so within ~28 days of a specific April release date is more restrictive.

The original Mario movie crossed $1B in ~21 days, well within the window. The sequel has similar or stronger fundamentals. Multiple expert sources call it a "near lock."

However, I must account for:
- ~15-20% chance the sequel significantly underperforms (poor reviews, audience fatigue, unexpected competition)
- ~5% chance of release delay or other disruption
- ~5% residual uncertainty

The probability that Super Mario Galaxy Movie crosses $1B before May 1 is approximately 75-80%. Since this is essentially the only realistic path to Yes, and there's a small chance another film surprises (Project Hail Mary, Michael opening weekend — though Michael has only 6 days), I'll set the overall probability at approximately 77%.

Outside View Prediction:
77%
