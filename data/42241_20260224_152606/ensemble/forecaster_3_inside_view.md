Analysis:
**1) Resolution criteria paraphrase (key alignment)**
Resolves **Yes** if **before May 1, 2026** Box Office Mojo’s **2026 worldwide year page** lists **any 2026 film** with **Worldwide ≥ $1.0B** (films are by release year, not “money earned in calendar year”).

## (a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, and what’s opinion vs fact)

1) **RollingStone-style “Most Anticipated Movies of 2026” (undated in excerpt; likely late 2025/early 2026)**
- **What it provides:** A preview list; mentions big franchises (Avengers/Star Wars/Dune) exist in 2026.
- **Quality:** Medium-low for forecasting this question: mostly editorial hype; no methodologies; also many of those tentpoles are **after May 1**.
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly opinion/anticipation; dates (where listed) are factual-ish but can be wrong.

2) **Rotten Tomatoes “Most Anticipated Movies of 2026” (editorial; excerpted)**
- **What it provides:** Early-year slate (Jan–Mar) skewing mid-budget/horror/streaming; no obvious $1B contender in that window.
- **Quality:** Medium for identifying “what’s coming,” low for predicting $1B outcomes.
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mixed; release dates are factual claims; “anticipated” framing is opinion.

3) **FirstShowing.net 2026 release schedule (living calendar list)**
- **What it provides (key):** Flags **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie** around **early April (often listed Apr 3)**; other mega-franchises largely **after May 1**.
- **Quality:** Medium: good as a compilation, but dates can move.
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly factual listings with caveats.

4) **CNBC (Jan 30, 2026) on franchise/IP and post-pandemic box office**
- **What it provides:** Structural context: overall box office still below 2019; franchises are “trickier;” word-of-mouth matters.
- **Quality:** High for macro context; moderate direct relevance (doesn’t answer whether *this* film hits $1B fast).
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mix; quotes from identifiable analysts (Wedbush/Comscore/Roth) are attributable; still qualitative.

5) **Hollywood Reporter (Jan 31, 2026) box office weekend report**
- **What it provides:** No current 2026 title near $1B; mostly small openings.
- **Quality:** High for near-term box office facts; limited relevance to April’s Mario.
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly factual reporting.

6) **Koimoi (Feb 22, 2026) “Michael could be first $1B film”**
- **What it provides:** Claims on trailer views and bullishness for *Michael* (Apr 24).
- **Quality:** Low-moderate: entertainment-site opinion; “analysts say” without clear methodology; useful mainly as a sentiment indicator.
- **Fact vs opinion:** Trailer views may be factual but unverified here; $1B claim is opinion/speculation.

7) **AskNews set: multiple Chinese-market articles (Feb 22–24, 2026)**
- **What it provides:** China’s 2026 box office is very strong; one title (“Fast & Furious 3” — appears to be a Chinese New Year release, despite the confusing title) is ~**2.8B RMB** in ~7 days; subsidies and strong attendance.
- **Quality:** Moderate for “China market strength” trend; low for “this implies a 2026 film crosses $1B worldwide before May 1” (no worldwide totals; titles may be local and not export widely).
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly reported figures and policy; “first globally” framing is interpretive.

8) **ScreenRant (Jan 28, 2026) “10 films will hit $1B”**
- **What it provides:** Very bullish projections; includes Mario Galaxy as $1B+.
- **Quality:** Low for numeric forecasting (pop outlet, incentive to hype).
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly opinion.

9) **Comicbook listicles (Jan 18 & Jan 25, 2026)**
- **What it provides:** Probabilities/claims various films might cross $1B later in 2026.
- **Quality:** Low-moderate (not market/industry forecasts); also mostly **after May 1**, so limited.
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly opinion.

10) **ScreenRant (Dec 18, 2025) citing Deadline/Gower Street Analytics projection**
- **What it provides:** A *named* analytics shop (Gower Street) projecting strong 2026 global box office and listing Mario Galaxy (Apr 3) as a key tentpole.
- **Quality:** Moderate-high (secondhand summary, but based on a professional forecaster).
- **Fact vs opinion:** Forecasting, but attributable to a real analytics entity.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence (large weight)**
- **Direct historical analog:** *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* (April release) reached **$1B within ~3 weeks** (outside-view anchor). This is the closest known reference class to “April family animation, huge IP, fast sprint to $1B.”
- **Release-schedule structure:** Most other billion-capable tentpoles (Avengers, Star Wars, Spider-Man, etc.) are **after May 1**, leaving **Mario Galaxy** as the primary realistic path.

**Moderate evidence (medium weight)**
- **Macro context (CNBC):** Post-pandemic theatrical is still below 2019; franchise fatigue risk is real; implies a non-trivial chance the sequel underperforms the original and/or has slower legs internationally.
- **Professional-forecast sentiment (Gower Street via ScreenRant summary):** 2026 projected strong globally; Mario positioned as a major driver—supports high prior that it’s a genuine mega-hit.

**Weak evidence (small weight)**
- **China market strength articles:** Helpful tailwind for global box office *if* Mario plays well there, but no direct linkage; many Chinese Spring Festival hits won’t export enough to reach $1B worldwide by May 1.
- **Koimoi on *Michael*:** Even if popular, an Apr 24 release has too little time to reach $1B before May 1; this is not a serious alternate path.

**Net:** The question still mostly reduces to: **Does “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” cross $1B worldwide on BOM by May 1?**

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- From **today (Feb 24, 2026)** to **resolution (May 1, 2026)** is **~66 days**.
- The key film (Mario Galaxy) has roughly **~28 days** (Apr 3 → May 1) to hit $1B.
- **If timeframe were halved** (e.g., resolve Apr 1): probability would drop sharply (near 0–5%) because Mario wouldn’t have released yet / would have no time.
- **If timeframe were doubled** (e.g., resolve ~mid-June): probability would rise materially (likely >85–90%) because Mario would have ~10+ weeks and other May releases might enter contention.

## (d) Justification (inside-view adjustments from the 77% outside view)
**Status quo if nothing changes:** No 2026 film is near $1B as of Feb 24; so **without Mario Galaxy performing like a true mega-hit**, the default is **No**.

**Why I’m slightly *lower* than the 77% outside view:**
- **Tight window risk + reporting/recognition risk:** Even a film on a $1B trajectory can miss the *“listed by BOM before May 1”* cutoff if it lands at ~$950M–$990M by then or crosses right at the end with lagging updates.
- **Sequel underperformance is common:** Many sequels to breakout hits drop (audience novelty fades). A 15–30% global decline from the original’s pace could be enough to delay $1B beyond May 1 even if it eventually gets there.
- **Macro softness remains:** Analysts emphasize that franchises aren’t automatic anymore; word-of-mouth matters more than in the pre-pandemic era.

**Why I’m still well above 50%:**
- The **closest analog** (Mario 2023) demonstrates the *exact* feat needed: April release → $1B before May.
- The **competitive landscape** before May 1 looks relatively weak; if Mario is strong, it can dominate screens and premium formats.

Probability calibration:
- **Outside view base rate (given): 77%**
- Adjustments:
  - (-) tighter-than-it-looks cutoff mechanics / possible BOM lag: ~ -3%
  - (-) sequel pace risk (needs to be *fast*, not just eventual $1B): ~ -4%
  - (+) lack of competing $1B-capable releases in-window: ~ +2%
- **Inside-view probability:** **72%**

Checklist:
1) **Paraphrase:** “Before May 1, 2026, does BOM’s 2026 worldwide page show any 2026 film at ≥$1B worldwide?”
2) **Outside view base rate:** 77%.
3) **Consistency check:** “In 72 out of 100 similar worlds, at least one 2026 film is listed by BOM at $1B+ worldwide before May 1, 2026.”
4) **Top evidence (3–5):**
   - Mario 2023 crossed $1B within ~3 weeks after an early-April release (close analog).
   - Mario Galaxy releases ~Apr 3, leaving ~28 days to May 1 (feasible but tight).
   - Most other mega-franchises are scheduled after May 1 (few alternative paths).
   - Post-pandemic/franchise fatigue increases odds of slower sequel trajectory (CNBC/analyst context).
5) **Blind spot:** A release-date shift or a meaningful underperformance (reviews/WOM) makes $1B by May 1 unattainable → would push probability toward ~30–40%.
6) **Status quo:** Currently no contender near $1B; outcome depends heavily on one upcoming title → keep meaningful uncertainty.

Probability: 72%
