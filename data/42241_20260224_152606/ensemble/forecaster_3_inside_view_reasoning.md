**Forecasting box office success**

I need to determine if at least one film in 2026 will reach a worldwide gross of $1B by May 1. Today is February 24. A strong candidate is Mario Galaxy, releasing on April 3. There are also films from the Chinese Spring Festival that might be contenders. For example, there's a Fast & Furious film that grossed about $390M in its first week, but it's unclear how much of that was worldwide. The Michael biopic and Pixar's Hoppers are also possibilities, but hitting $1B seems unlikely for them.**Assessing box office risks**

I'm considering several risks for predicting whether a film will reach $1B by May 1, 2026. There could be delays in releases or reporting, and competition might impact performance. If a film like Mario Galaxy, releasing April 3, can cross the $1B mark quickly, it could succeed, but updates on BOM might lag, affecting the final count. Currently, I estimate the probability of hitting that milestone at around 70-75%, especially given the weak early 2026 lineup. I’ll proceed to analyze sources to validate this.
