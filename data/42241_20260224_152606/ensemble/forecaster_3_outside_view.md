Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality/date; facts vs opinions)
- **Box Office Mojo 2026 worldwide page (snapshot, early 2026; primary data source for resolution):**  
  *Facts:* As of the captured snapshot, no 2026 film is anywhere near $1B; the leader is *Wuthering Heights* at ~$152M. This is high-quality for current standings (and the official resolution source), but it’s inherently backward-looking and doesn’t forecast. Also, BOM pages can lag or revise totals.  
  *Relevance:* Establishes that, as of **Feb 24, 2026**, nothing is close—so a “Yes” must come from a late-March/April release accelerating quickly.

- **Screen Rant (Jan 31, 2026) on *The Super Mario Galaxy Movie*:**  
  *Facts:* Release date (early April 2026) and prior film’s $1.36B are directionally correct.  
  *Opinions:* The writer’s view that it will beat $1.36B is non-expert commentary; Screen Rant is not a forecasting authority.  
  *Use:* Weak evidence on its own; mainly useful for identifying the key candidate and the narrative that it could be enormous.

- **Rotten Tomatoes “Most Anticipated Movies of 2026” (excerpted; date unclear but contemporaneous):**  
  *Facts:* Lists early-2026 releases; nothing in the excerpt screams $1B.  
  *Limitations:* Incomplete excerpt; “anticipated” ≠ “will gross $1B.”  
  *Use:* Mild support for the idea that Jan–Mar aren’t likely to produce a surprise $1B hit.

- **IMDb release calendar (contemporary listing):**  
  *Facts:* Dates/entries for releases; not a box office source.  
  *Use:* Helps identify that *Super Mario Galaxy* is the standout pre–May 1 tentpole; otherwise low inferential value.

- **Hollywood Reporter anticipated releases list (excerpted):**  
  *Facts:* Confirms multiple big 2026 titles; *Mario* in April; *Mandalorian & Grogu* is after May 1.  
  *Opinions:* “Anticipated” framing; no quantified forecast.  
  *Use:* Confirms that the pre–May 1 window is thin on billion-dollar caliber films besides *Mario*.

- **NBC News (Jan 4, 2026) about *Avatar: Fire and Ash* and *Zootopia 2* passing $1B:**  
  *Facts:* Those films crossing $1B (and *Zootopia 2* far beyond) is plausible and reported as accomplished.  
  *Critical caveat:* The question metadata says the **resolution window starts Feb 24, 2026** and “events before this date do not count.” So—even if true—these *January* milestones should not be counted toward resolving this question.  
  *Use:* Low direct relevance given the window rule; more about general box office strength.

- **Screen Rant (Dec 18, 2025) re: Gower Street Analytics projecting 2026 worldwide box office:**  
  *Facts:* A named analytics firm projecting a strong 2026 is moderately credible.  
  *Opinions:* It’s still a projection; also not directly tied to “before May 1.”  
  *Use:* Raises background base rate that 2026 could have big hits, but timing remains the key bottleneck.

- **Variety (2026) “sure things” list including *Super Mario Galaxy Movie* as billion-dollar potential:**  
  *Facts:* Trade publication; better than fan sites.  
  *Opinions:* Still punditry—no hard model disclosed. But “billion-dollar potential” from Variety is meaningful directional evidence.  
  *Use:* Strongest “expert-media” support that *Mario* is plausibly a $1B film.

- **Agent report (mixed sources + LLM aggregation; Jan–Feb 2026 context):**  
  *Facts:* Good as a curated list of candidates and claimed forecasts, but several items (IndieWire “near lock,” Polymarket odds, specific gross estimates) are not independently verifiable from what’s provided here.  
  *Use:* Treat as suggestive only. Its key insight—that *Mario* is essentially the only realistic pre–May 1 path—is consistent with the other sources.

**Net from sources:** As of Feb 24 no film is close; the *only* plausible way to get a $1B “before May 1” is an April breakout—overwhelmingly *The Super Mario Galaxy Movie*.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view baselines)
I’d consider three reference classes:

1) **All calendar years:** “At least one film reaches $1B by May 1.”  
   - Suitability: weak, because it ignores whether a likely $1B contender is scheduled before May 1.  
   - Likely base rate: historically not that high (many $1B films arrive in summer/holiday).

2) **Years with a true four-quadrant event film released in April:**  
   - Suitability: better, because timing is central. April megahits sometimes clear $1B quickly (e.g., *Endgame*), but many April hits take longer than a month to reach $1B or never do.

3) **Sequels/follow-ups to prior $1B family/animation hits, released with ~4 weeks before a cutoff:**  
   - Suitability: best match to the actual mechanism here (*Mario* sequel; family skew; April release; about four weeks to hit $1B).  
   - Key empirical uncertainty: (i) sequel conversion rate to $1B, and (ii) “speed to $1B” for family films (often leggy; may reach $1B after 4–8 weeks rather than within 4).

**Chosen reference class:** #3 (billion-dollar predecessor → sequel with ~1 month to reach $1B).

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Now:** 2026-02-24  
- **Deadline:** 2026-05-01  
- **Time left:** ~66 days total, but for practical purposes the key window is **release-to-deadline** for the only plausible candidate:
  - *The Super Mario Galaxy Movie* releases ~Apr 1–3 → only **~28–30 days** to reach $1B.

**Pattern:** $1B within ~30 days is common for the biggest modern global event films, but less guaranteed for animated/family titles (which can have strong legs yet slower accumulation). Therefore, “eventual $1B” is not the same as “$1B by May 1.”

---

### (d) Justification (outside view synthesis)
- Status quo (if nothing changes): No film is remotely close as of Feb 24 (top ~$152M). So the event requires a *new* release to surge.
- The pre–May 1 slate (from IMDb/press lists) appears to contain **one** true $1B-caliber candidate: *The Super Mario Galaxy Movie*. Other March titles (*Project Hail Mary*) could be big but are not standard $1B “locks,” and late-April releases have too little time.
- Therefore the question is effectively: **Will the Mario sequel reach $1B worldwide within ~4 weeks of release?**
- Outside view on that mechanism:
  - Sequels to $1B films often still do very well, but a meaningful minority miss $1B (franchise fatigue, weaker overseas, substitution to streaming, etc.).
  - Even among films that *eventually* cross $1B, hitting it within ~30 days is not guaranteed—especially for family titles that can be leggy rather than front-loaded.

So the outside view lands around “modestly better than a coin flip,” driven by (i) a strong candidate exists, but (ii) the timing constraint is tight and the candidate set is basically one film.

Outside view calibration:

- **Anchor/base rate:** In many years, no film reaches $1B as early as May 1; the unconditional rate feels clearly below 50%.  
- **Adjustment for this year’s setup:** This year is not “unconditional”—there is a direct analog: a follow-up to a recent $1B+ phenomenon releasing in early April, giving a plausible shot at reaching $1B by end of April. That should pull the probability upward substantially.
- **Upset rate / why not 80–90% (outside view discipline):**
  - Sequel underperformance happens with non-trivial frequency.
  - The *speed* requirement (by May 1) adds extra ways to fail: it might still be a $1B film but cross the mark in May/June.
  - Measurement timing: Box Office Mojo reporting updates/revisions can lag.

Given these, I calibrate to a probability a bit above 50%, not “near-certain.”

Outside View Prediction:
**52.4%**
