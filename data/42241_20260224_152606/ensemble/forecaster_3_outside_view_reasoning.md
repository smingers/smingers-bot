**Evaluating box office predictions**

I'm thinking about whether at least one film will surpass $1 billion at the worldwide box office in 2026 before May 1. The window starts with an opening date of February 24, 2026, which adds some complexity, since earnings before that don't count. For example, if Avatar: Fire and Ash crossed $1 billion on January 4, 2026, it wouldn’t be valid. So, if a film crosses $1 billion before February 24, it wouldn't count towards this query.**Analyzing box office potential**

The question specifies earnings in 2026, but films that crossed $1 billion before February 24, like those released in 2025, won’t count. By that date, Box Office Mojo might show their grosses, but since the earnings occurred before the opening, they’re excluded. I should focus on films reaching $1 billion after February 24 and before May 1, like Super Mario Galaxy. Additionally, I’ll need to analyze reference classes of sequels that surpassed $1 billion or those hitting that mark in under a month.**Using historical data for predictions**

I'm considering the historical number of films that have reached $1 billion per year to evaluate the chances of at least one doing so in the early part of 2026. The short window between February 24 and May 1 is crucial, depending heavily on the release schedule. In typical years, there are usually 1-3 $1 billion films, but rarely before May 1. For example, Avengers: Endgame hit that mark in just five days, while Mario achieved it in about 25 days. For 2026, the potential exists with a Mario sequel releasing April 1.**Assessing probability for box office success**

I'm looking to determine the probability that a film reaches $1 billion by May 1. I want to use the outside view, examining what fraction of films that ultimately gross over $1 billion achieve that within about 30 days. Many do, but not all, and some may not even reach $1 billion at all. Given that this is a sequel to a $1.36 billion film, the base rate suggests that around 70% of sequels to $1 billion films typically cross that mark.**Calculating cross probability by May 1**

By May 1, the movie has only about 28-30 days, and while many family animations tend to have long legs, they might cross $1 billion later. If Mario opens lower or has weak international performance, it could miss that mark. I need to provide a probability estimate, maybe around 65-75%. Historical data shows between 20-30% for films reaching $1 billion by May 1 from 2010 to 2019. However, with a strong franchise and likely success, let’s set the outside view around 55%. Ultimately, it's all about the April release and its performance.**Estimating the probability of crossing $1B**

I’m estimating the outside view for the film reaching $1 billion by May 1. I think a reasonable probability is about 52.4%. To ground this, I’ll consider several reference classes. For example, historically, about 30% of years since 2010 have had at least one film hit that mark before May 1. With major April releases like Mario and sequels to successful films, the probability may rise to around 46%. I recognize some risk factors, including potential underperformance and competition, but I believe this estimated 52% is a fair baseline.
