Analysis:

1. Paraphrased question & criteria  
“At least one 2026-released movie must appear on Box Office Mojo with ≥ $1 billion worldwide by 1 May 2026.”  Any grosses reached before 24 Feb 2026 or after 30 Apr 2026 do not count.

2. Source analysis (quality / fact vs opinion)

• Box Office Mojo 2026 YTD list (24 Feb 2026 snapshot).  High-quality factual data; top film only US$152 M.  
• FirstShowing, Rotten Tomatoes, Rolling Stone preview calendars (late-2025/early-2026).  Factual release dates; speculative box-office language = opinion.  
• CNBC, Hollywood Reporter industry pieces (Jan–Feb 2026).  Trade/financial press; good for recent franchise performance figures, but forward commentary is opinion.  
• Koimoi “3 reasons Michael will hit $1B” (22 Feb 2026).  Low-tier entertainment site; almost entirely opinion.  
• Chinese press reports on Spring-Festival takings (23-24 Feb 2026).  Credible for RMB figures; relevance limited—highest film ≈ US$390 M so far.  
• ScreenRant “2026 could break record” (28 Jan 2026) & ComicBook forecasts.  Fan press; useful to flag candidates, but opinions.  
Overall: one hard data source (BOM), several reasonable trade-press trend pieces, many opinion pieces of modest weight.

3. Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence  
• Historical precedent: The first Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) opened early April and reached $1 B on day 26.  
• Current BOM table shows no existing 2026 title close ⇒ a new release must do the job.  Structural and hard to change.

Moderate evidence  
• Trailer engagement for Super Mario Galaxy (Billboard: 116 M views in 24 h) suggests large pent-up demand.  
• Gower Street/Deadline (Dec 2025) global forecast: 2026 strongest post-pandemic year, driven by big IP.  Identifiable analytic firm, but still a forecast.  
• Chinese market strength (multiple outlets) indicates overseas revenue potential, yet no single Chinese film close to $1 B.

Weak evidence  
• Koimoi hype for Michael, ComicBook “4 films sure to cross,” Vandal summer look-ahead—mostly speculative punditry.  
• Project Hail Mary / other March titles lack billion-dollar track record.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Today → resolution = 66 days.  Key candidate Super Mario Galaxy opens 3 Apr (±2 d) → ~28 days to amass $1 B.  Halving window (14 days) would slash chances; doubling (56 days) would make “Yes” very likely.

5. Justification / inside-view update  
Outside-view base rate (built earlier) = 52 %.  
Adjustments:  
− Single realistic path: almost entirely hinges on Super Mario Galaxy.  Concentration risk –6 pts.  
− Evidence that predecessor hit $1 B in identical calendar slot and speed +5 pts.  
− Sequel drop-off/fatigue risk −4 pts (Despicable Me 3, Minions 2 examples).  
− Advertising buzz/trailer metrics +3 pts.  
− Chinese New-Year blockbusters and “Michael” biopic add only ~2 % combined tail-probability.  
Net shift: −7 pts from base.

Probability calibration

“I expect that in 45 out of 100 parallel 2026s, at least one film posts $1 B worldwide on Box Office Mojo before 1 May.”

Checklist:

• Outside-view base: 52 %.  
• Final key evidence (≤ 20 words each):  
  1. Mario 1 hit $1 B in 26 days (2023 precedent).  
  2. Mario 2 trailer scored 116 M 24-h views.  
  3. Only Mario releases before May capable of $1 B.  
  4. Current YTD leader just $152 M—ground to cover.  
  5. Sequel drop-offs frequent post-pandemic.  
• Blind-spot: Mario release date could shift up a week (earlier) or open much bigger than model → probability should be higher.  
• Status-quo outcome = “No”; inertia pushes slightly toward ‘No’, consistent with 55 % “No”.

Probability: 45%
