**Crafting a forecast**

I need to create a detailed forecast answer by doing a source analysis, summarizing major sources, and weighing the evidence. I’ll define a timeframe and justify the predictions. 

Initially, I have an outside view probability of 52.4%. I’ll consider inside info, like the Super Mario Galaxy movie releasing early April and the Michael biopic on April 24. However, it seems unlikely for either film to cross 1B globally. Chinese blockbusters typically perform well domestically but don’t often reach that mark internationally, making the 1B target seem ambitious.**Estimating Mario's success**

It looks like the Super Mario movie is my main candidate for hitting 1B by April 30, given its previous success. The first film grossed $1.36B and hit 1B in just 26 days, which fits our timeframe perfectly. 

However, sequels can sometimes underperform, or they might surprise us. The second movie seems to have strong interest, with a trailer that received more views than the first one. If it opens between $450-500M, reaching 1B in three weeks could be feasible, but I need to consider the risk of franchise fatigue. Based on historical data from similar films, family animated films have been known to achieve this, so it’s possible for Mario too.**Calculating probabilities of success**

I estimate the probability of the Mario movie reaching 1B within 28 days at around 60%. If I consider the chance of it eventually hitting 1B, that's about 70%, leading to an overall probability of 42% by May 1.

Other films like the Project Hail Mary and the Michael biopic in April seem unlikely to gross 1B soon, each possibly at 5%. The chance of Chinese films reaching 1B globally by May 1 looks negligible.

So, combining Mario's success with others, I adjust Mario's success probability to 45%. I'll finalize my analysis to ensure everything checks out correctly.
