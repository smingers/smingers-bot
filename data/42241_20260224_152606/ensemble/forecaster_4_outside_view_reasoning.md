**Clarifying box office predictions**

I need to create a thorough outside view prediction, but it's essential to avoid using inside view content like Avatar Fire and Ash or Zootopia 2, especially since they already surpassed $1B. I must clarify the resolution criteria: do they want the box office earnings specifically from 2026? It seems like it refers to worldwide earnings in that calendar year. The Box Office Mojo page for 2026 includes films that are released in or attributed to 2026, including late 2025 releases. So, I’m navigating the categorization carefully.**Analyzing earnings and film releases**

When considering box office earnings, I realize that a film like Avatar: Fire and Ash, set for a 2025 release, may show earnings in 2026. However, Box Office Mojo organizes by release date, not by earnings year, meaning it wouldn't appear in the 2026 yearly page. As of February 24, 2026, no films have surpassed $152M, making the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy Movie a significant contender for 2026. Historical data reveals that very few films released between January 1 and April 30 cross the $1B mark by May 1, so the odds are slim.**Calculating film success probabilities**

In analyzing film earnings from 2009-2025, I've found that only four films reached $1B by May 1 across 17 years, giving a baseline success rate of about 24%. There were notable releases like Furious 7, Beauty & the Beast, and Avengers Endgame. For 2026, I recognize that there's a prospect for early releases, especially considering the Super Mario Galaxy Movie. However, my analysis remains focused on broad historical trends rather than specific film details, allowing for adjustments based on patterns in the industry. The probability for early 2026 films might land closer to 25%.**Assessing blockbuster trends**

I’m noticing a trend where early-year blockbusters have become more frequent over the last decade, with notable hits in 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2023. That gives us a frequency of about 44% over nine years. Adjusting for the pandemic slump, it's reasonable to estimate the probability closer to 40%. However, I think I'll settle around 35% for 2026, as it provides a balanced view while considering recent industry changes. Let’s move ahead with this.
