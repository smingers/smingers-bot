Analysis:
1. Paraphrase of question & criteria  
“Between now (24 Feb 2026) and 1 May 2026, will Box Office Mojo’s 2026 worldwide chart show any 2026-release that has already grossed ≥ US$1 billion?”  

(a) Source analysis (chronological)  
• FirstShowing, Rolling Stone excerpt, Rotten Tomatoes calendars (Dec 2025-Feb 2026).  Fact: only one mega-tent-pole scheduled before 1 May – The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (SMG) on 3 Apr. All Avengers/Star Wars/Toy Story etc arrive after the cut-off.  Mostly schedule data (high reliability); opinions minimal.  
• Koimoi (22 Feb 2026).  Opinion article touting Michael (24 Apr) as a billion-dollar shot; Koimoi is click-oriented, no methodology ⇒ low weight.  
• CNBC (30 Jan 2026) & Hollywood Reporter (31 Jan 2026).  Trade press with hard numbers: early-2026 releases are opening in the $5-18 m domestic range – far from billion-dollar trajectories.  High factual quality, weak relevance.  
• Chinese-language cluster (23-24 Feb 2026).  Confirm Spring-Festival blockbusters topping out at ≈ 2.8 bn RMB (≈ US$390 m).  Strong factual, shows no Chinese title close to $1 b.  
• ScreenRant “could be biggest year ever” (28 Jan 2026).  Speculative listicle; identifies SMG as only pre-May billion-dollar candidate.  Moderate source, mostly opinion.  
• Gower Street Analytics via Deadline (18 Dec 2025).  Forecast of $35 bn global box office; not film-specific.  Single expert source, moderate evidential weight.  

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
– Release schedule: only SMG (3 Apr) gives ≥ 26 days to amass $1 b before 1 May.  
– Historical earnings speed: Mario (2023) hit $1 b in 26 days; Endgame in 5 days; Furious 7 in 17 days.  Demonstrates feasibility if demand is high.  
Moderate:  
– Trailer metrics (SMG clip & Michael trailer) show large interest (Koimoi, Billboard) but are marketing-side indicators.  
– Gower Street projection of robust 2026 market suggests macro tail-wind.  
Weak:  
– Koimoi’s bullish take on Michael; very short seven-day runway to 1 May makes impact negligible.  
– Any Chinese blockbuster clearing $1 b; historic ceiling ≈ US$900 m.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• 67 days remain.  A film releasing after 10 Apr would have < 20 days – historically only Endgame-level phenomena hit $1 b that fast, and no such title is on the calendar.  
• If we halved the window (to mid-Mar) probability would plunge to ≈ 5% (no qualifying releases).  Doubling (to 1 Aug) probability would soar (> 90%) once Toy Story 5, Spider-Man, Avengers, etc. enter.  

(d) Justification & inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate 30 % (4 of last 16 years had an early-year $1 b hit).  
Adjustments:  
– Slate scarcity (only one realistic contender) −10 pp  
– SMG sequel’s strong precedent, four-quadrant IP, Illumination’s sequel track record +15 pp  
– Post-pandemic volatility / possibility of date slippage or lukewarm reception −5 pp  
– Chinese market unlikely to supply a surprise billion-dollar title next 2 months −2 pp  
Net inside-view: 30 –10 +15 –5 –2 ≈ 28 % → re-check vs SMG specific modelling.  

Film-specific Fermi:  
P(open on 3 Apr as planned) ≈ 95 %  
Conditional on timely release:  
 – P(SMG ever reaches $1 b) ≈ 65 %  
 – P(it does so by day 28) given it will cross $1 b ≈ 80 %  
Multiplying: 0.95 × 0.65 × 0.80 ≈ 49 %.  
Add ≈ 1 % for all other possibilities → 50 %.  

Reconciling rough-cut 28 % vs film-specific 50 %, I average, giving more weight to the inside view because only one pathway exists.  Weighted 70 % to film-specific, 30 % to base:  
0.7 × 50 % + 0.3 × 28 % ≈ 43 %.  
Round to nearest 5 % for communication clarity → 45 %.  

Probability calibration:
“I expect that in about 45 out of 100 futures like this one, at least one 2026 release will have topped $1 b worldwide by 1 May 2026, most paths running through The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.”  
I would widen my 80 % confidence interval to 30-60 %; a ±10 pp move would require (a) credible news of a Mario release delay, or (b) tracking forecasts showing a $400 m+ five-day global opening.

Checklist:
• Title & criteria paraphrased and matched.  
• Outside view base = 30 %; final prediction still anchored.  
• Consistency line above passes sanity test.  
• Top evidence items (≤ 20 wds each):  
  1. Only SMG (3 Apr) releases early enough.  
  2. 2023 Mario hit $1 b in 26 days.  
  3. Chinese Spring-Festival hits ≤ US$0.4 b so far.  
  4. No Avengers/Star Wars/Toy Story before 1 May.  
• Blind-spot: SMG suffers major late-stage delay or boycott, dropping its opening below $200 m. Would cut probability to < 15 %.  
• Status-quo outcome (“no $1 b” year-so-far) slightly favours ‘No’, hence forecast tilted below 50 %.

Probability: 45%
