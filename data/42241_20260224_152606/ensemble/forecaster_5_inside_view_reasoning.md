**Considering potential films**

I'm structuring my final answer into sections: Analysis, Probability Calibration, and a Checklist with Probability figures. I need to apply an outside view estimate of 30% and adjust it accordingly. The timeframe is from February 24 to May 1, 2026, and I'm examining which films might cross $1B by then.

The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is set to release on April 3, giving it 28 days to May 1. It had a strong prior release, but it's not guaranteed. The film Michael releases on April 24, which leaves only 7 days, making it extremely unlikely to hit the mark. There are no big releases from franchises like Avengers or Star Wars until later, but there's still the potential for Avatar 3 to cross $1B if it counts.**Analyzing box office criteria**

The film was released on December 17, 2025, but it won't count toward the 2026 earnings since it was released in a previous year. According to Box Office Mojo, only films that have a worldwide gross of at least $1B earned in 2026 are listed. Even though a film might continue earning in January 2026, it doesn't qualify as a 2026 release.

For candidates before May 1, 2026, "Mario" releasing on April 3 is a strong contender. Other films like Pixar's potential "Hoppers," and various sequels seem unrealistic. The probability of a film crossing $1B hinges mostly on Mario's performance and any surprise successes from Chinese films during the Spring Festival, but those rarely exceed $1B globally. Therefore, the overall probability seems to be less than 30%.**Calculating Mario's box office probability**

I think a base probability of 30% could be high, especially since the early part of 2026 has limited candidates. So maybe adjusting it down to around 25% makes sense. The Super Mario Bros Movie earned $1.36 billion, hitting $1 billion in about 26 days after its April 5, 2023, release, so that creates an analogue.

Its sequel, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, might replicate or exceed that. However, there's always a risk that sequels perform less well due to interest dropping. I believe realistically it could cross $1 billion by May 1 with a probability of around 40-50%. 

The only major candidate is Mario, so the overall probability of crossing $1 billion relies heavily on its performance. Adding a potential Chinese film could enhance the chance—though they rarely exceed $700 million, thus having a tiny probability.

Considering all these factors, including marketing and audience fatigue, I estimate the final probability at about 40%. If Mario could cross $1 billion, let’s say it’s around 60%. Overall, after adjusting for possible delays, the final probability will be about 52.25%.**Refining box office probabilities**

I'm refining my probability estimates for the film's performance. I estimate a 15% chance of it flopping with total earnings under $500M, a 30% chance of earning between $500M and $1B, and a 55% chance of exceeding $1B eventually. By May 1, about 90% of the films expected to cross $1B might do so, which gives a probability of around 49.5% if it releases on time. Taking into account the chance of schedule reliability and the improbability of a Chinese film crossing $1B, I adjust it to about 48%. However, considering the general post-pandemic trend and audience fatigue, I decide on a final estimate of 45%. Now, it’s time to craft a comprehensive analysis.
