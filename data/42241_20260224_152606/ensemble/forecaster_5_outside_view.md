Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
1. Box Office Mojo “2026 Worldwide Box Office” (snapshot early-Feb 2026).  
   • Purely factual, automatically generated totals.  
   • Shows no 2026 release anywhere near US $1 B.  
   • High-quality source; data current to within days.

2. NBC News, 4 Jan 2026 – “Avatar: Fire and Ash crosses $1 B”.  
   • Factual reporting, corroborated by studio communiqués and Comscore.  
   • Film was released Dec 2025, so it will appear on Box Office Mojo’s 2025 page and is immaterial for this question.  
   • High reliability for the statistic reported, but low direct relevance.

3. Screen Rant, 31 Jan 2026 – opinion column on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.  
   • Mostly speculative, authored by a journalist (not an industry analyst).  
   • Contains one datapoint that The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) earned $1.36 B (verifiable).  
   • Moderate source quality for facts, low for forecasts.

4. Screen Rant, 18 Dec 2025 – piece quoting Gower Street Analytics projection of a US $35 B global box office in 2026.  
   • The factual part (projection and quoted figure) is credible because Gower Street is a recognised consulting firm.  
   • Everything else is journalistic commentary.

5. Variety 2026 outlook article (January 2026).  
   • Trade-press analysis; author unnamed in excerpt but Variety staff are generally well sourced.  
   • Lists films deemed “sure things” or “safe bets”; that portion is clearly opinion rather than fact.

6. Rotten Tomatoes “Most Anticipated Movies of 2026” (undated, captured Feb 2026).  
   • Listicle; subjective excitement ranking, limited hard data.

7. IMDb release calendar (continuously updated).  
   • Pure schedule information.  
   • High reliability for release dates, though always “subject to change”.

8. Agent report (LLM synthesis, Feb 2026).  
   • Secondary compilation from public sources plus some market-implied odds (Polymarket).  
   • Useful as a catalogue but unverified; treat numbers as unconfirmed until cross-checked.

(b)  Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. Years 2010-2025: incidence of a film released between 1 Jan and 30 Apr that reached US $1 B worldwide by 1 May of the same year.  
2. Post-COVID era (2022-2025) only.  
3. Years in which a single well-known mega-franchise instalment (Marvel, animated four-quadrant, or Fast & Furious) was scheduled before May.

Class 1 (16 observations) gives the broadest base rate and minimises cherry-picking while keeping industrial context similar (modern tent-pole era).  
Class 2 controls for pandemic drag but the sample is very small (3 observations).  
Class 3 would already build in knowledge of this year’s slate and therefore slides toward an inside view.  

I choose Class 1.

Using trade press archives and Box Office Mojo totals:  

Years with a qualifying $1 B film by 1 May:  
• 2015 (Furious 7)  
• 2017 (Beauty & the Beast)  
• 2019 (Captain Marvel, Avengers Endgame)  
• 2023 (The Super Mario Bros. Movie)  

Possible but uncertain: 2010 (Alice in Wonderland reached $1 B in late May, so exclude).  

Count: 4 “yes” years out of 16 → base frequency ≈ 25%.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
Today: 24 Feb 2026.  The window to accumulate a $1 B grosser closes in 67 days.  
Historical pattern: in the years listed above, the successful films accomplished the feat 17–26 days after release (Furious 7, Beauty & the Beast, Mario) or in Endgame’s case just 5 days.  Therefore a film opening on or before roughly 10 Apr can in principle still pass $1 B by 1 May, matching past velocity.  

(d)  Justification for outside-view probability  
• The unadorned historical base rate from 2010-2025 is 25%.  
• Structural industry changes argue modest upward drift: studios now bunch more mega-franchise titles into Q1/Q2 because of summer congestion, and front-loaded international roll-outs speed up dollar accumulation.  
• Conversely, pandemic after-effects and streamer competition dampened early-year grosses in 2020-2022, partially offsetting the upward drift.  

Net adjustment: +5 percentage-points feels proportionate—large enough to acknowledge faster earning curves, small enough to keep this an outside-view estimate rather than an inside-view call.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 25% (historical frequency).  
Adjustment for quicker global day-and-date releases and IP clustering: +5 pp.  
Adjustment for lingering box-office volatility / chance of year-specific shocks: 0 pp (leaves 30%).  
Cross-check: Over 16-year sample, no result below 10% or above 40% seems justified; 30% sits well within that band.  
Base-rate upsets: three of the four “yes” years were driven by films many analysts already expected to hit $1 B, yet three “no” years (2011, 2012, 2018) also had early mega-releases that fell just shy by 1 May.  That history counsels caution against going materially higher than one-in-three without bringing in film-specific information.

Outside View Prediction:
