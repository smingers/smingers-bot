**Evaluating film predictions**

I need to craft an answer that provides a clear analysis with specific components and a final outside view prediction, focusing on historic rates rather than current information. The outside view should come from past trends and not adjust for inside knowledge. But wait, I see that films like Avatar: Fire and Ash and Zootopia 2 have already crossed $1B in early 2026, which means my prediction for a film surpassing $1B before May 1, 2026, should be very close to 100%.**Clarifying resolution criteria**

The question specifies that the film needs to earn at least $1B in worldwide gross for the year 2026, not just cumulatively. It seems I need to focus on films released in 2026, since Box Office Mojo classifies by release date, not total earnings. Films like Avatar: Fire and Ash, released in late 2025, won’t count. 

As of February 24, 2026, no films have yet reached over $1B. I’ll look at historical data from 2010 to 2025 to determine how often films released in January-April exceeded $1B by May 1, giving me the necessary probability.**Compiling historical data**

I need to gather data from 2010 to 2025 to see if at least one film released by May 1 each year surpassed $1B worldwide. Some films released late the previous year wouldn’t count, as they fall outside the specified timeframe. 

So, looking at actual data: in 2010, "Alice in Wonderland" likely crossed by late May but not by May 1. Over the years, I identified a few films like "Furious 7," "Beauty and the Beast," "Captain Marvel," and "The Super Mario Bros Movie" that did cross the threshold. In total, that gives me about 4 out of 16 years, establishing a base rate of 25%. However, COVID impacted some years, so I should keep that in mind when interpreting the data.**Analyzing film release probabilities**

Considering the post-pandemic recovery, I note that only one year out of three (2023) saw a film surpass $1B, which gives a 33% base rate. However, 2026 seems promising with strong early releases, like Mario 2, which follow the successful 2023 model. While that’s an inside view, if I incorporate recent patterns of early April successes, I might slightly raise the probability, estimating it around 30%. 

Looking back, several films released in late April or early May have crossed $1B by May 1, and establishing a probability of around 30-35% seems reasonable. I'll keep in mind that, while I have knowledge of upcoming releases, it should be carefully integrated into my analysis. Now I should summarize my sources for a thorough evaluation before finalizing a numeric calibration.
