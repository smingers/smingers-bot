## Summary: *The Super Mario Galaxy Movie* Box Office Outlook (Screen Rant, Jan. 31, 2026)

### Key Facts
- **The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)** earned **$1.36 billion** worldwide, the second-highest-grossing film of 2023 behind *Barbie*
- **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie** is scheduled to release on **April 1, 2026**
- A second trailer was released on **January 26, 2026**, focusing heavily on the addition of **Yoshi** and multi-world exploration

### Author's Revised Assessment
- The author (a Screen Rant writer, not an independent analyst) initially expected the sequel to be a big hit but fall **short of $1 billion**, citing:
  - Difficulty reaching the $1B benchmark generally
  - Absence of the pent-up excitement that drove the original's performance
  - The original's mixed critical reception (59% critics / 95% audience on Rotten Tomatoes)
- After viewing the **second trailer**, the author reversed their position, now predicting the sequel will **surpass the original's $1.36B** and potentially be the **highest-grossing film of 2026**
- Key reasons for the revised outlook: the sequel appears more ambitious in scope, deeper in game references, and capable of recapturing viewers who were lukewarm on the original
- The film is also noted to have a **favorable release window**, launching ahead of summer blockbusters with limited competition for several weeks

## Summary: Most Anticipated Movies of 2026

**Note:** The article appears to be cut off partway through March 2026 releases, so the summary reflects only what was provided.

## Summary: 2026 Box Office Projections (Screen Rant, December 18, 2025)

### Key Projection
Gower Street Analytics (via Deadline) projects **2026 worldwide box office at $35 billion** — comprising $9.9 billion domestic and $25.1 billion international (including $7.1 billion from China alone). This would make 2026 the **biggest box office year of the 2020s**, though still below pre-pandemic levels (2017–2019 all exceeded $40 billion globally).

### Context
Box office recovery has been hampered by COVID-19 shutdowns (2020) and the dual writers/actors strikes in 2023 (148 and 118 days respectively). Despite individual hits like *Spider-Man: No Way Home*, *Top Gun: Maverick*, and *Avatar: The Way of Water*, overall recovery has been slow.

### Key 2026 Titles Driving Projections
**Early 2026 (relevant to the question's pre-May 1 window):**
- *The Super Mario Galaxy Movie* — April 3
- *Ready or Not 2* — April 10
- *Michael* (biopic) — April 24
- *The Devil Wears Prada 2* — May 1 *(borderline)*

**Later in 2026** (not relevant to pre-May 1 resolution but supporting overall projections): *Toy Story 5*, *Spider-Man: Brand New Day*, *Avengers: Doomsday*, *Dune: Part Three*, Christopher Nolan's *The Odyssey*, among others.

### Relevance to the Forecasting Question
The article highlights **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3)** as a major early 2026 blockbuster, with a linked Screen Rant article suggesting it could surpass the original *Super Mario Bros. Movie*'s $1.3 billion gross. The 2026 projections also benefit from capturing most of *Avatar: Fire and Ash*'s box office run (which began in late 2025).

## Summary: Box Office 2026 Predictions (Variety)

**Source:** Variety article analyzing major 2026 film releases and their box office prospects.

**Overall Context:** The article notes that since COVID, the box office has become harder to predict. Marvel has struggled recently while unexpected films like *Sinners* and *Demon Slayer* became 2025 successes. The article attempts to forecast which 2026 films will succeed or struggle.

### Films Predicted as "Sure Things" (Billion-Dollar Potential):

- **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie** (Universal, April 3): Predicted to perform similarly to the original *Super Mario Bros. Movie*, which was "a billion-dollar smash." Nintendo brand cited as dominant.
- **Toy Story 5** (Disney, June 19): Predicted to be "the biggest family film of the year."
- **The Odyssey** (Universal, July 17): Christopher Nolan film with Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Zendaya. Predicted to be a blockbuster based on Nolan's July track record (*The Dark Knight*, *Dunkirk*).
- **Spider-Man: Brand New Day** (Sony, July 31): Tom Holland returning; *No Way Home* grossed $1.9 billion. Described as still on the "comic book A-list."

### Films Predicted as "Safe Bets":
- **The Mandalorian and Grogu** (Disney, May 22): Will benefit from goodwill but faces uncertainty about whether audiences still associate *Star Wars* with theatrical viewing.
- **Avengers: Doomsday** (Disney, Dec. 18): Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans returning; six-year gap since last *Avengers* cited as favorable, despite acknowledged "superhero fatigue."

### Films Flagged as "Question Marks":
- **Project Hail Mary** (Amazon MGM, March 20): Ryan Gosling sci-fi; $150M budget; Amazon MGM lacks track record with original properties.
- **Disclosure Day** (Universal, June 12): Spielberg alien-invasion film; uncertainty about whether non-IP films can draw audiences.
- **Clayface** (Warner Bros., Sept. 11): Body-horror comic adaptation; article is cut off before verdict.

---

**Key Implicit Finding for the Forecasting Question:** The article identifies *The Super Mario Galaxy Movie* (releasing **April 3, 2026**) as a near-certain billion-dollar hit, placing it well before the May 1, 2026 resolution deadline. This is the most directly relevant data point for the question at hand.

# Major Movies Releasing Worldwide January–April 2026: Box Office Forecasts & $1 Billion Prospects

## Overview

2026 is shaping up to be a landmark year for theatrical cinema, with analysts and industry observers broadly optimistic about box office performance. The January–April window specifically contains several notable releases, though the most anticipated blockbusters with genuine $1 billion potential are concentrated in April and the surrounding months. Below is a structured breakdown of the major releases, analyst forecasts, and the likelihood of a film surpassing $1 billion before May 1, 2026.

---

## Major Films Releasing January–April 2026

### January 2026
- **Greenland 2: Migration** (Jan. 9) – Lionsgate; Gerard Butler, Morena Baccarin. Sequel to the 2020 disaster film. Mid-tier commercial expectations.
- **Dead Man's Wire** (Jan. 9) – Gus Van Sant thriller; Bill Skarsgård, Al Pacino, Colman Domingo. Awards-adjacent, not a blockbuster.
- **28 Years Later: The Bone Temple** (Jan. 16) – Nia Da Costa directs; Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell. Horror sequel following the 2025 revival. Modest box office expectations.
- **Mercy** (Jan. 23) – Chris Pratt, Rebecca Ferguson sci-fi thriller. Mid-range commercial film.
- **Send Help** (Jan. 30) – Sam Raimi returns to horror/thriller; Rachel McAdams, Dylan O'Brien. Anticipated but not a blockbuster candidate.
- **The Moment** (Jan. 30) – Charli XCX semi-autobiographical pop star film.

### February 2026
- **Wuthering Heights** (Feb. 13) – Emerald Fennell directs; Margot Robbie, Jacob Elordi. High-profile literary adaptation with Charli XCX original music. Significant buzz but not a $1B candidate; one analyst estimates ~$175M–$225M worldwide.
- **How to Make a Killing** (Feb. 20) – A24; Glen Powell. Indie-leaning thriller.
- **Scream 7** (Feb. 27) – Kevin Williamson directs; Neve Campbell returns. Horror franchise entry; analyst estimate ~$100M worldwide.

### March 2026
- **The Bride!** (March 6) – Maggie Gyllenhaal directs; Christian Bale, Jessie Buckley. Punk Bride of Frankenstein remake. Prestige/arthouse crossover.

- **Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man** (March 6 limited / March 20 Netflix) – Cillian Murphy returns as Tommy Shelby. Netflix hybrid release limits theatrical ceiling.
- **Reminders of Him** (March 13) – Colleen Hoover adaptation; Maika Monroe, Rudy Pankow. Romance drama; moderate commercial expectations.
- **Project Hail Mary** (March 20) – Phil Lord & Christopher Miller direct; Ryan Gosling. Andy Weir sci-fi adaptation. High anticipation; IndieWire lists it as a "potential contender" but not a near-lock for $1B. Polygon and Deadline both highlight strong trailer views.
- **Ready or Not 2: Here I Come** (March 27) – Samara Weaving, Kathryn Newton. Horror comedy sequel; mid-range expectations.

### April 2026
- **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie** (April 3) – Universal/Illumination/Nintendo; Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Brie Larson, Jack Black. **The single most important film for the $1B question before May 1.**
- **The Drama** (April 3) – A24; Zendaya, Robert Pattinson. Romantic dramedy; prestige rather than blockbuster.
- **Michael** (April 24) – Lionsgate; Jaafar Jackson as Michael Jackson, directed by Antoine Fuqua. Music biopic with massive potential; analyst estimates range from $700M to $1.5B.

## Analyst Forecasts & $1 Billion Assessments

### The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3) — **Primary $1B Candidate Before May 1**

This is the consensus pick among analysts and forecasters as the first film likely to cross $1 billion in 2026, and the only realistic candidate to do so before May 1.

- **IndieWire** (January 6, 2026) lists The Super Mario Galaxy Movie as one of six films that are "near locks to surpass $1 billion worldwide" in 2026.
- **UpcomingOnScreen** forecasts **$1.5 billion** worldwide, explicitly stating: *"I can confidently predict it will be the first $1,000,000,000 film of the year."* The analyst notes the original 2023 film was underestimated and smashed expectations, and the sequel benefits from an established world, fan-favorite characters (Yoshi, Rosalina), and Easter timing.
- **Covers.com** (citing Polymarket prediction markets as of January 6, 2026) ranks The Super Mario Galaxy Movie as the #2 most likely film to be the top-grossing movie of 2026, behind only Spider-Man: Brand New Day.
- **Collider** notes the original Super Mario Bros. Movie grossed over $1.36 billion, making it the most profitable video game movie ever, and anticipation for the sequel is "sky-high."
- **Screen Rant** (referenced in the question context) has published commentary suggesting the Galaxy sequel could beat the $1.3B original.
- The film releases April 3, giving it approximately 4 weeks of box office accumulation before the May 1 resolution deadline. Given the original film crossed $1B in roughly 3 weeks in 2023, this timeline is highly feasible.

### Michael (April 24) — **Possible but Tight Timeline**
- Analyst estimates range widely: $700M–$1.5B (UpcomingOnScreen), with the caveat that it "could easily be wrong on either side."
- Releases April 24, leaving only ~6 days before the May 1 deadline — making it essentially impossible to accumulate $1B in that window even with a record-breaking opening.

### Project Hail Mary (March 20) — **Unlikely to Reach $1B Before May 1**
- IndieWire lists it as a "potential contender" but not a near-lock. No analyst forecast puts it at $1B before May 1.

---

## Broader 2026 Box Office Context

- **2025 full-year global box office**: approximately $8.6 billion (IndieWire, January 2026), slightly above 2024 but still well below pre-pandemic levels (~$11B+).
- **2025's $1B films**: Only four films crossed $1B in all of 2025 — Zootopia 2, Avatar: Fire and Ash, Lilo & Stitch, and China's Ne Zha 2. A Minecraft Movie came close but fell short.
- **2026 full-year $1B projections**: IndieWire counts **six near-locks** for $1B in 2026: Avengers: Doomsday, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, live-action Moana, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Toy Story 5, and The Odyssey. A Bloomberg survey of 700 industry experts (cited by High On Films) places Avengers: Doomsday as the predicted highest-grossing film of 2026, potentially crossing $2B.
- **Historical Avengers benchmark**: The four prior Avengers films averaged ~$1.9B globally, with Endgame reaching $2.797B.

---

## Assessment: Will a Film Surpass $1B Before May 1, 2026?

**The probability is high, driven almost entirely by The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3).**

Key supporting factors:
1. The original 2023 film crossed $1B in approximately 3 weeks, well within the ~4-week window before May 1.
2. Multiple independent analysts (IndieWire, UpcomingOnScreen, Covers/Polymarket) explicitly forecast $1B+ for the sequel.
3. The film has strong IP, established audience, Easter holiday timing, and no major competing blockbusters in early April.
4. Nintendo's active involvement and deeper game references (Galaxy is a beloved title) broaden appeal.

Key risks:
- The sequel could underperform if reviews disappoint or audience fatigue sets in (IndieWire notes "one of those six will probably fall short").
- China box office is uncertain — the original underperformed there, and that weakness could limit the global ceiling.
- No other January–March film has a realistic path to $1B before May 1.

**Conclusion**: The Super Mario Galaxy Movie releasing April 3 is the dominant candidate, with strong consensus forecasts of $1B+ and a sufficient theatrical window before May 1. The question resolves **Yes** with high probability, barring a catastrophic critical or commercial failure of the film.</Agent_report>
