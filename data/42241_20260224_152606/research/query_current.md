Analysis:
The key is identifying any film released between 1 Jan – 30 Apr 2026 that either 1) already shows exceptionally strong pre-sales/early overseas grosses (e.g., a late-January China launch) or 2) is widely expected by industry analysts to clear the US$1 billion mark within its first 3-4 months. Relevant articles will discuss: studio release calendars for Q1 2026, tracking reports, franchise strength (Marvel, Star Wars, Nintendo, Pokémon, MCU X-Men, etc.), IMAX/China distribution deals, and early box-office performance if any February releases are already out. Useful sources include Deadline, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, and trade analyst newsletters. Therefore the queries focus on (a) the 2026 release slate, (b) industry commentary on “billion-dollar” potential, and (c) any hard box-office data emerging since January 2026.
