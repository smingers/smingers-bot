Analysis:
To judge whether a film will cross US$1 billion worldwide before 1 May 2026, the most useful historical context is:
• How often $1 billion films appear in a typical year and specifically in the January-April window (e.g., Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel, The Batman, etc.).  
• The early-2026 release slate—what tent-pole franchise entries are dated for Jan-Apr 2026 (e.g., Disney/Marvel, DC, Nintendo/Illumination’s next Mario, Kung Fu Panda 5, etc.).  
• Current industry commentary about the post-pandemic theatrical market, China’s openness, FX rates, and whether analysts expect any of those titles to have $1 billion potential.  

Therefore I want (1) a clean list of scheduled 2026 releases, (2) recent news articles quoting box-office analysts on those films’ prospects, and (3) broader commentary tying historical $1 billion frequency to upcoming titles.
