As of January 2026, the box office has seen strong legs from 2025 releases like Avatar: Fire and Ash, Marty Supreme, Zootopia 2, and The Housemaid, but new releases such as 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, Mercy, and Greenland 2: Migration have not yet gained traction. Studios typically reserve their biggest films for spring, summer, and winter, when theater attendance peaks. The 2019 record\u2014nine $1 billion films, including Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, and Frozen II\u2014remains unmatched since the pandemic. In recent years, only 2022 and 2024 achieved three billion-dollar films, and 2025 saw four. However, 2026 is projected to surpass that record with ten films expected to reach $1 billion: Avengers: Doomsday, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, Toy Story 5, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, The Mandalorian and Grogu, live-action Moana, Minions 3, The Odyssey (Christopher Nolan), Dune: Part Three, and Jumanji 3. Additional films like Mortal Kombat II, Masters of the Universe, Supergirl, Disclosure Day, Resident Evil, Street Fighter, and The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping could also exceed expectations, and major Chinese blockbusters might further boost the total.

Two additional films\u2014Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse and The Legend of Zelda\u2014are considered hopeful contenders. This surge in high-grossing sequels follows a trend of declining original content, as the 2020s have seen fewer billion-dollar films compared to the 2010s. In 2025, only four films reached the $1 billion mark: Ne Zha 2, Zootopia 2, the live-action Lilo and Stitch, and Avatar: Fire and Ash (which crossed the threshold in January 2026). While 2027\u2019s performance would signal recovery from post-pandemic box office struggles, it still falls short of 2019\u2019s peak, when nine films achieved the milestone. The 2019 list included Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Frozen 2, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Captain Marvel, Joker, Star Wars: Episode IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker, Toy Story 4, and Aladdin. Despite the optimism, the reliance on sequels and franchises raises concerns about audience fatigue and the sustainability of the current model.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 07:30 PM\nSource:[Comicbook](https://comicbook.com/movies/feature/2027-could-break-the-decades-billion-dollar-movie-record/)\n\n**4 2026 Blockbusters We're Convinced Can Break $1 Billion in the Box Office**\nFour films are projected to cross $1 billion at the global box office in 2026: The Mandalorian & Grogu, Toy Story 5, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, and Avengers: Doomsday. The Mandalorian & Grogu has a 60% chance of reaching $1 billion, leveraging the franchise\u2019s established fanbase despite a decline in popularity after its second season. Toy Story 5 has a 75% chance, benefiting from the franchise\u2019s legacy, though a drop from Toy Story 4\u2019s performance is expected due to the perceived diminishing returns of sequels after a satisfying conclusion. Spider-Man: Brand New Day has an 85% chance, driven by Tom Holland\u2019s enduring popularity and the franchise\u2019s strong track record, though it is expected to fall short of No Way Home\u2019s record. Avengers: Doomsday is considered the most likely to surpass $1 billion, with Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s return as a major draw, despite a reported budget exceeding $600 million, making its financial success contingent on strong performance. While other films like The Odyssey could potentially reach $1 billion, they are not considered as likely as these four.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[Comicbook](https://comicbook.com/movies/list/4-2026-blockbusters-were-convinced-can-break-1-billion-in-the-box-office/)\n\n**The 2026 Summer Box Office Has 5 Films Capable of Breaking Records in One Month: Understanding Hollywood's Anticipation**\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted cinema consumption habits, leading to a notable decline in global box office revenue. Since theaters began recovering, only eleven films have surpassed the $1 billion mark, with the most recent being 'Lilo & Stitch.' 2025 was a relatively weak year, but 2026 is poised to revitalize the box office with five major summer releases expected to break records. These include 'Toy Story 5' on June 19, 'Mega Minions' on July 1, the live-action 'Moana' on July 10, Christopher Nolan\u2019s 'The Odyssey' starring Tom Holland on July 17, and 'Spider-Man: Brand New Day' on July 31. The success of these films\u2014particularly one or two reaching $1 billion\u2014could signal a strong comeback for mass cinema. Industry analysts suggest 2026 may be a pivotal year in restoring the box office to its pre-pandemic vitality.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[Vandal](https://vandal.elespanol.com/random/el-verano-de-2026-tiene-5-estrenos-capaces-de-romper-records-de-taquilla-en-un-mes-entendemos-la-expectacion-de-hollywood/38708.html)\n\n**Clube do Bilh\u00e3o: Veja os 57 Filmes que Alcan\u00e7aram US$ 1 Bilh\u00e3o em Bilheteria**\nThe article lists the 57 films worldwide that have grossed over US$ 1 billion at the box office, excluding inflation adjustments. Despite the milestone, some films reached this mark after re-releases or expanded screenings in specific markets, such as 'Harry Potter', 'Titanic', and 'Avatar'. Over more than a century of commercial cinema, the industry has produced only a select number of global-scale projects capable of drawing massive audiences across diverse markets, even with the rise of streaming. Achieving US$ 1 billion in box office revenue remains a rare accomplishment, reserved for a small number of films with exceptional international appeal. The list is presented without inflation adjustment.

This includes $9.9 billion from the domestic market and $25.1 billion internationally, with $7.1 billion of that from China alone. The projection marks a significant recovery from the pandemic's impact in 2020 and the 2023 double strike that disrupted production and release schedules. While 2026's total still falls short of pre-pandemic years, which each grossed over $40 billion worldwide, it is expected to surpass all previous years in the 2020s. The surge is attributed to a strong lineup of major blockbuster releases, including The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3), The Mandalorian and Grogu (May 22), Toy Story 5 (June 19), Supergirl (June 26), Minions 3 (July 1), live-action Moana (July 10), Spider-Man: Brand New Day (July 31), The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping (November 20), Jumanji 3 (December 11), Avengers: Doomsday (December 18), and Dune: Part Three (December 18). Additional high-potential releases include sequels like Scream 7 (February 27), Practical Magic 2 (September 18), and Scary Movie 6 (June 12), as well as non-franchise films such as Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Odyssey (July 17), Steven Spielberg\u2019s Disclosure Day (June 12), Emerald Fennell\u2019s Wuthering Heights (February 13), and the Michael Jackson biopic Michael (April 24). The forecast assumes 2025\u2019s Avatar: Fire and Ash will not contribute to 2026\u2019s total during its first 13 days of release.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 18, 2025 03:06 PM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/2026-global-box-office-projections-record/)\n\n**Zoomania 2 Surpasses $1 Billion at Global Box Office, Joining Elite 2025 Club**\nThe fantasy blockbuster 'Zoomania 2' has surpassed the $1 billion global box office milestone, becoming only the third film in 2025 to achieve this feat, according to Variety. The film, released in German cinemas on November 26, 2025, follows the investigative duo Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick (Jason Bateman) as they confront a conspiracy involving the theft of a valuable book by the snake Gary De'Snake (Ke Huy Quan). After a nearly decade-long wait since the original 'Zoomania' (2016), the sequel broke multiple box office records, with its $1 billion mark reached in record time for a Hollywood animated film. It joins Disney's live-action 'Lilo & Stitch' and China's 'Ne Zha 2' as the only two other films in 2025 to cross the $1 billion threshold. The final major release of the year, 'Avatar 3: Fire and Ash,' is set to premiere on December 17, 2025, and may aim to surpass the $2 billion mark achieved by its predecessors.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 05:45 PM\nSource:[moviepilot - Filme nach Deinem Geschmack](https://www.moviepilot.de/news/neuer-fantasy-blockbuster-hat-jetzt-eine-milliarde-eingespielt-nur-2-andere-filme-haben-das-dieses-jahr-schon-geschafft-1159146)\n\n**American Box Office May Exceed $9 Billion in 2025 for First Time Since 2019**\nAmerican box office revenues in the United States and Canada are projected to exceed $9.1 billion in 2025, marking the first time since 2019\u2014before the pandemic\u2014that the market surpasses $9 billion. According to analysts from Comscore, box office receipts have already risen by approximately 4% compared to 2024, and if this momentum continues, 2025 will be the strongest year for cinema since the pandemic began. Macquarie analysts anticipate major autumn releases, including 'Thor: Love and Thunder' (corrected to 'Thor: Love and Thunder' as '\u0422\u0440\u043e\u043d: \u0410\u0440\u0435\u0441' is the Russian title), 'Wicked: For Good', and 'Zootopia 2', each expected to earn at least $250 million in North America. The most anticipated release of the year is likely 'Avatar: The Fire and the Ash', which could become the highest-grossing film of 2025. Previous 'Avatar' films have grossed over $2 billion worldwide. Eric Handler from Roth Capital Partners forecasts fourth-quarter revenues of $2.5 billion\u20147% higher than the same period in 2024. He also expects 2025\u2019s total to reach $9.1 billion, a 5% increase over 2024. Future films expected to drive growth include 'Toy Story 5', 'Minions 3', the finale of the 'Dune' trilogy, 'Spider-Man: Fresh Start', and 'The Avengers: Doomsday'. Box Office Mojo data shows that North American ticket sales exceeded $10 billion annually from 2009 to 2019. In 2020, sales plummeted to $2.1 billion due to pandemic-related theater closures, after which they gradually recovered.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 10:59 AM\nSource:[Interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/world/1051279)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
