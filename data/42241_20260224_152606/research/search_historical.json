Marvel has struggled recently while unexpected films like *Sinners* and *Demon Slayer* became 2025 successes. The article attempts to forecast which 2026 films will succeed or struggle.\n\n---\n\n### Films Predicted as \"Sure Things\" (Billion-Dollar Potential):\n\n- **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie** (Universal, April 3): Predicted to perform similarly to the original *Super Mario Bros. Movie*, which was \"a billion-dollar smash.\" Nintendo brand cited as dominant.\n- **Toy Story 5** (Disney, June 19): Predicted to be \"the biggest family film of the year.\"\n- **The Odyssey** (Universal, July 17): Christopher Nolan film with Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Zendaya. Predicted to be a blockbuster based on Nolan's July track record (*The Dark Knight*, *Dunkirk*).\n- **Spider-Man: Brand New Day** (Sony, July 31): Tom Holland returning; *No Way Home* grossed $1.9 billion.

The January\u2013April window specifically contains several notable releases, though the most anticipated blockbusters with genuine $1 billion potential are concentrated in April and the surrounding months. Below is a structured breakdown of the major releases, analyst forecasts, and the likelihood of a film surpassing $1 billion before May 1, 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Major Films Releasing January\u2013April 2026\n\n### January 2026\n- **Greenland 2: Migration** (Jan. 9) \u2013 Lionsgate; Gerard Butler, Morena Baccarin. Sequel to the 2020 disaster film. Mid-tier commercial expectations.\n- **Dead Man's Wire** (Jan. 9) \u2013 Gus Van Sant thriller; Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Al Pacino, Colman Domingo. Awards-adjacent, not a blockbuster.\n- **28 Years Later: The Bone Temple** (Jan. 16) \u2013 Nia Da Costa directs; Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell. Horror sequel following the 2025 revival. Modest box office expectations.\n- **Mercy** (Jan. 23) \u2013 Chris Pratt, Rebecca Ferguson sci-fi thriller. Mid-range commercial film.\n- **Send Help** (Jan. 30) \u2013 Sam Raimi returns to horror/thriller; Rachel McAdams, Dylan O'Brien. Anticipated but not a blockbuster candidate.\n- **The Moment** (Jan. 30) \u2013 Charli XCX semi-autobiographical pop star film.\n\n### February 2026\n- **Wuthering Heights** (Feb. 13) \u2013 Emerald Fennell directs; Margot Robbie, Jacob Elordi. High-profile literary adaptation with Charli XCX original music. Significant buzz but not a $1B candidate; one analyst estimates ~$175M\u2013$225M worldwide.\n- **How to Make a Killing** (Feb. 20) \u2013 A24; Glen Powell. Indie-leaning thriller.\n- **Scream 7** (Feb. 27) \u2013 Kevin Williamson directs; Neve Campbell returns. Horror franchise entry; analyst estimate ~$100M worldwide.\n\n### March 2026\n- **The Bride!** (March 6) \u2013 Maggie Gyllenhaal directs; Christian Bale, Jessie Buckley. Punk Bride of Frankenstein remake. Prestige/arthouse crossover.\n- **Hoppers** (March 6) \u2013 Pixar animated film; Jon Hamm, Meryl Streep. Mid-tier Pixar; analyst estimates place it below $500M.\n- **Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man** (March 6 limited / March 20 Netflix) \u2013 Cillian Murphy returns as Tommy Shelby. Netflix hybrid release limits theatrical ceiling.\n- **Reminders of Him** (March 13) \u2013 Colleen Hoover adaptation; Maika Monroe, Rudy Pankow. Romance drama; moderate commercial expectations.\n- **Project Hail Mary** (March 20) \u2013 Phil Lord & Christopher Miller direct; Ryan Gosling. Andy Weir sci-fi adaptation. High anticipation; IndieWire lists it as a \"potential contender\" but not a near-lock for $1B. Polygon and Deadline both highlight strong trailer views.\n- **Ready or Not 2: Here I Come** (March 27) \u2013 Samara Weaving, Kathryn Newton. Horror comedy sequel; mid-range expectations.\n\n### April 2026\n- **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie** (April 3) \u2013 Universal/Illumination/Nintendo; Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Brie Larson, Jack Black. **The single most important film for the $1B question before May 1.**\n- **The Drama** (April 3) \u2013 A24; Zendaya, Robert Pattinson. Romantic dramedy; prestige rather than blockbuster.\n- **Michael** (April 24) \u2013 Lionsgate; Jaafar Jackson as Michael Jackson, directed by Antoine Fuqua. Music biopic with massive potential; analyst estimates range from $700M to $1.5B.\n\n---\n\n## Analyst Forecasts & $1 Billion Assessments\n\n### The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3) \u2014 **Primary $1B Candidate Before May 1**\n\nThis is the consensus pick among analysts and forecasters as the first film likely to cross $1 billion in 2026, and the only realistic candidate to do so before May 1.\n\n- **IndieWire** (January 6, 2026) lists The Super Mario Galaxy Movie as one of six films that are \"near locks to surpass $1 billion worldwide\" in 2026.\n- **UpcomingOnScreen** forecasts **$1.5 billion** worldwide, explicitly stating: *\"I can confidently predict it will be the first $1,000,000,000 film of the year.\"* The analyst notes the original 2023 film was underestimated and smashed expectations, and the sequel benefits from an established world, fan-favorite characters (Yoshi, Rosalina), and Easter timing.\n- **Covers.com** (citing Polymarket prediction markets as of January 6, 2026) ranks The Super Mario Galaxy Movie as the #2 most likely film to be the top-grossing movie of 2026, behind only Spider-Man: Brand New Day.\n- **Collider** notes the original Super Mario Bros. Movie grossed over $1.36 billion, making it the most profitable video game movie ever, and anticipation for the sequel is \"sky-high.\"\n- **Screen Rant** (referenced in the question context) has published commentary suggesting the Galaxy sequel could beat the $1.3B original.\n- The film releases April 3, giving it approximately 4 weeks of box office accumulation before the May 1 resolution deadline. Given the original film crossed $1B in roughly 3 weeks in 2023, this timeline is highly feasible.\n\n### Michael (April 24) \u2014 **Possible but Tight Timeline**\n- Analyst estimates range widely: $700M\u2013$1.5B (UpcomingOnScreen), with the caveat that it \"could easily be wrong on either side.\"\n- Releases April 24, leaving only ~6 days before the May 1 deadline \u2014 making it essentially impossible to accumulate $1B in that window even with a record-breaking opening.\n\n### Project Hail Mary (March 20) \u2014 **Unlikely to Reach $1B Before May 1**\n- IndieWire lists it as a \"potential contender\" but not a near-lock. No analyst forecast puts it at $1B before May 1.\n\n---\n\n## Broader 2026 Box Office Context\n\n- **2025 full-year global box office**: approximately $8.6 billion (IndieWire, January 2026), slightly above 2024 but still well below pre-pandemic levels (~$11B+).\n- **2025's $1B films**: Only four films crossed $1B in all of 2025 \u2014 Zootopia 2, Avatar: Fire and Ash, Lilo & Stitch, and China's Ne Zha 2. A Minecraft Movie came close but fell short.\n- **2026 full-year $1B projections**: IndieWire counts **six near-locks** for $1B in 2026: Avengers: Doomsday, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, live-action Moana, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Toy Story 5, and The Odyssey. A Bloomberg survey of 700 industry experts (cited by High On Films) places Avengers: Doomsday as the predicted highest-grossing film of 2026, potentially crossing $2B.\n- **Historical Avengers benchmark**: The four prior Avengers films averaged ~$1.9B globally, with Endgame reaching $2.797B.\n\n---\n\n## Assessment: Will a Film Surpass $1B Before May 1, 2026?\n\n**The probability is high, driven almost entirely by The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3).**\n\nKey supporting factors:\n1. The original 2023 film crossed $1B in approximately 3 weeks, well within the ~4-week window before May 1.\n2. Multiple independent analysts (IndieWire, UpcomingOnScreen, Covers/Polymarket) explicitly forecast $1B+ for the sequel.\n3. The film has strong IP, established audience, Easter holiday timing, and no major competing blockbusters in early April.\n4. Nintendo's active involvement and deeper game references (Galaxy is a beloved title) broaden appeal.\n\nKey risks:\n- The sequel could underperform if reviews disappoint or audience fatigue sets in (IndieWire notes \"one of those six will probably fall short\").\n- China box office is uncertain \u2014 the original underperformed there, and that weakness could limit the global ceiling.\n- No other January\u2013March film has a realistic path to $1B before May 1.\n\n**Conclusion**: The Super Mario Galaxy Movie releasing April 3 is the dominant candidate, with strong consensus forecasts of $1B+ and a sufficient theatrical window before May 1. The question resolves **Yes** with high probability, barring a catastrophic critical or commercial failure of the film.</Agent_report>\n"
