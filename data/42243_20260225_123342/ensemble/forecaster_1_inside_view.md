11. **Booming stock market fueling classic art (New York Post, Dec 14, 2025)** - Mainstream media. Factual: Klimt *Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer* sold for $236.4M at Sotheby's (November 2025); Frida Kahlo at $55M; Rothko at $62M. High quality for factual sales data. **Critical**: The Klimt sale was in November 2025, BEFORE the question's February 25, 2026 opening date — does NOT count for resolution.

12. **Klimt record at Sotheby's (CNN Arabic, Nov 27, 2025)** - Reputable source. Confirms Klimt at $236.4M in November 2025. Pre-resolution window. Irrelevant to resolution but confirms market capacity.

13. **16 auction records set in November 2025 (Artsy, Nov 24, 2025)** - High-quality art market source. Confirms Klimt at $236.36M on November 18, 2025. Pre-resolution window.

14. **Klimt smashes records at Sotheby's (CNN International, Nov 19, 2025)** - Highly reliable. Confirms Klimt at $236.4M. Pre-resolution window. Also mentions Christie's $690M 20th-century auction in fall 2025.

18. **Hong Kong fall auctions disappoint (artnet News, Oct 2, 2025)** - High-quality. Confirms Hong Kong results. Pre-resolution window.

**Summary of source quality**: The most reliable and relevant sources are CNN International, artnet News, Wallpaper*, and NEWSIS. The key factual finding is that the Klimt $236.4M sale occurred in November 2025 (pre-resolution window) and no $100M+ painting has been announced for the Feb 25 - May 1, 2026 window.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence (large shifts):**
- **No $100M+ painting announced for the resolution window**: The Sotheby's spring 2026 sales (April-May) have been announced with no individual painting near $100M. The de Gunzburg collection's top painting is a Rothko at $10-15M. Christie's March 5, 2026 Surreal sale has top lot ~£9.5M (~$12M). This is strong negative evidence. The absence of announced qualifying lots is a powerful predictor given the typical 4-8 week advance announcement timeline for major sales.
- **Timing mismatch**: The major spring New York sales (where $100M+ lots historically appear) typically occur in May, after the May 1, 2026 deadline. This structural timing factor is strong negative evidence.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Art market softening**: Fine art sales declined from $10.8B (2022) to $7.04B (2025), an 8.8% H1 2025 decline. This reduces the probability of surprise $100M+ consignments. Moderate negative evidence.
- **Shift to private sales**: Christie's private sales up 41%, Sotheby's up 17% in 2024. Ultra-high-value works increasingly transact privately, reducing the probability of a public $100M+ sale. Moderate negative evidence.
- **November 2025 Klimt sale at $236.4M**: Demonstrates that buyer demand for $100M+ paintings exists, but this was in the fall season. Moderate positive evidence for market capacity, but doesn't directly support a pre-May 2026 sale.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Stock market boom driving art demand**: The New York Post article suggests a market rebound. Weak positive evidence — speculative connection to a specific pre-May sale.
- **Kandinsky at Christie's estimated £15M**: Far below threshold. Weak negative evidence.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window is approximately **65 days** (February 25 to May 1, 2026). This is a narrow window.

- **If halved (~32 days, to ~March 29)**: Probability would drop to roughly 5-7%. The only announced sale in this period (Christie's March 5 Surreal sale) has no qualifying lots, and there's even less time for an unannounced consignment to materialize.
- **If doubled (~130 days, to ~July 1)**: Probability would rise to roughly 25-35%. The main May spring New York sales would be included, where $100M+ lots are more common. The Sotheby's spring New York sales typically occur in mid-May.

The narrow window and the structural timing of major sales (May, post-deadline) are the dominant factors.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting point**: Outside view base rate of 13%.

**Key factors shifting the estimate:**

1. **No announced qualifying consignment** (strong negative): The most powerful factor. For a painting to sell for $100M+ before May 1, it would need to be consigned, announced, and sold within the 65-day window. Major auction houses typically announce $100M+ lots 4-8 weeks in advance. As of February 25, 2026, no such lot has been announced. This is strong negative evidence that suppresses the probability significantly.

2. **Structural timing** (strong negative): Spring New York sales (the primary venue for $100M+ lots) occur in May, after the deadline. The only major spring sale announced within the window (Christie's March 5 London) has no qualifying lots.

3. **Market softening** (moderate negative): The art market has declined structurally, with total sales down ~35% from 2022 peak. This reduces the likelihood of surprise ultra-high-value consignments.

4. **Shift to private sales** (moderate negative): The trend toward private sales for ultra-high-value works reduces the probability of a public $100M+ sale.

5. **Market capacity exists** (weak positive): The November 2025 Klimt sale at $236.4M shows buyer demand exists. However, this doesn't translate to a near-term public sale.

6. **Possible unannounced special sale** (weak positive): There's always a small probability that an unannounced consignment could materialize. Estate sales, emergency liquidations, or special single-owner sales can be organized quickly. However, this is speculative.

**Net assessment**: The combination of no announced qualifying lots, structural timing mismatch, and market softening strongly supports a probability below the outside view base rate of 13%. I estimate approximately **8-10%**.

The 13% outside view already accounts for the narrow window. The additional negative evidence from the absence of announced qualifying lots pushes this lower. However, I don't want to go below ~7% because there's always a non-trivial possibility of an unannounced special sale or a surprise consignment.

**Probability Calibration**

- Outside view: 13%
- Adjustment for no announced qualifying lots: -4%
- Adjustment for structural timing (May sales post-deadline): already embedded in outside view
- Adjustment for market softening and private sales trend: -1%
- Residual uncertainty (unannounced special sales, surprise consignments): +0%
- **Final estimate: ~8-9%**

I'll set my final probability at **9%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria paraphrase**: Will Christie's, Sotheby's, or Phillips publicly report a painting sold at auction for ≥$100M between Feb 25 and May 1, 2026?
   - ✓ Analysis aligns with criteria. Only public auction sales of paintings count. The Klimt sale (Nov 2025) is pre-resolution window and does NOT count.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 13% (narrow 65-day pre-May window, historically few $100M+ sales before May 1).
   - ✓ Final prediction of 9% is rooted to this base rate with justified downward adjustments.

3. **Consistency check**: "9 out of 100 times, a painting sells for $100M+ at Christie's, Sotheby's, or Phillips before May 1, 2026." This is consistent with the evidence — no announced qualifying lots, narrow window, structural timing mismatch.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - No $100M+ painting announced for spring 2026 sales (strong negative, factually valid)
   - Spring NY sales typically occur in May, after deadline (structural, factually valid)
   - Art market down ~35% from 2022 peak (moderate negative, factually valid)
   - Shift to private sales for ultra-high-value works (moderate negative, factually valid)
   - Klimt $236.4M sale in Nov 2025 shows buyer capacity exists (weak positive, factually valid but pre-window)

5. **Blind spot**: A major estate or single-owner collection could be announced and sold in a special evening sale before May 1, 2026, without prior public announcement. This scenario (perhaps 5-8% probability) would make my forecast look too pessimistic. However, given the lead time required for major sales, this remains unlikely.

6. **Status quo outcome**: No $100M+ painting sale before May 1, 2026. The world changes slowly; the absence of announced qualifying lots and structural timing strongly supports the status quo (no resolution). A slight nudge toward the status quo is appropriate.

Probability: 9%
