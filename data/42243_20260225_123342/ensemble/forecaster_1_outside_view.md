Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

- **Christie's/Sotheby's/Phillips press pages**: These returned minimal content (cookie notices, navigation only). Not useful for direct evidence, but their absence of announced $100M+ lots is weakly informative.

- **Barnebys article (Aug 2025)**: Educational explainer on hammer price vs. buyer's premium. High quality for definitional purposes. Confirms that reported prices typically include buyer's premium, relevant to resolution criteria.

- **CultureType (May 2017)**: Historical record of Basquiat's $110.5M sale at Sotheby's. Reliable historical documentation. Not directly relevant to 2026 forecast but establishes precedent.

- **Wikipedia - List of Most Expensive Paintings**: Aggregated historical data. Generally reliable for well-documented sales, though some entries may be incomplete. Useful for establishing base rates.

- **Verus Art - Monet article**: Commercial source (art reproduction company), but the specific Monet Meules sale at $110.7M in 2019 is well-documented and verifiable. Useful for confirming precedent.

- **Christie's press release (April 2025)**: Official source. Warhol's Big Electric Chair estimated ~$30M — not relevant to $100M threshold.

- **Christie's editorial (Nov 2025)**: Official source. Highest result mentioned was $20.4M — no $100M+ results in that editorial.

- **Christie's Surreal Evening Sale press release (March 5, 2026)**: Official source, very recent. Top lot estimated at ~£9.5M (~$12M). Clearly not approaching $100M threshold.

- **Agent Report**: Comprehensive synthesis. Claims Gustav Klimt's *Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer* sold for $236.4M at Sotheby's in November 2025 — this is a past event (before the question's February 25, 2026 opening date) and thus does NOT count toward resolution. The agent report explicitly notes no $100M+ consignments have been announced for spring 2026. The agent's probability estimate of 25-40% is an opinion from an AI agent, not an identifiable human expert.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are possible:

1. **"Probability of at least one $100M+ painting sale in any given calendar year (2013-2025)"**: Since 2013, there has been at least one $100M+ painting sale in most years. Counting: 2013 (yes), 2014 (no), 2015 (yes, multiple), 2016 (yes), 2017 (yes, multiple), 2018 (yes), 2019 (yes), 2020 (unclear/COVID), 2021 (no, Basquiat at $93M was close), 2022 (yes, multiple), 2023 (yes), 2024 (yes), 2025 (yes). Roughly 10-11 out of 13 years = ~77-85% per year.

2. **"Probability of at least one $100M+ painting sale in a specific ~2-month window (Jan-April)"**: The question window is Feb 25 - May 1, 2026, roughly 2 months. Historically, major spring sales occur in May (after the deadline). The pre-May window is narrower. Looking at when $100M+ sales occurred historically: most happen in May (spring) or November (fall). A pre-May 1 sale would need to be in a special or early sale. This reference class gives a much lower base rate — perhaps 15-25% of years see a $100M+ painting sale before May 1.

3. **"Probability of a $100M+ sale given no announced qualifying consignment"**: When no $100M+ lot has been publicly announced, the probability drops substantially. However, consignments are sometimes announced close to sale dates.

The most suitable reference class is #2 — the specific pre-May 1 window — combined with the absence of announced qualifying consignments.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question window is approximately 65 days (Feb 25 to May 1, 2026). This is a narrow window. Historically:
- Christie's and Sotheby's major spring New York sales typically occur in **May**, which falls AFTER the deadline.
- London spring sales (March-April) occasionally feature high-value lots but rarely reach $100M.
- The Christie's Surreal Evening Sale on March 5, 2026 (already announced) has no lots near $100M.
- No other spring 2026 sales with $100M+ estimates have been announced.
- The major trophy consignments (Lauder Collection, Weis Collection) were sold in fall 2025.

The compressed timeframe and the fact that the main spring New York sales fall after May 1 significantly reduces the probability.

**(d) Justification**

Key factors:
- **Base rate**: ~77-85% chance per year, but the specific pre-May 1 window is much narrower. Historically, $100M+ sales before May 1 are uncommon — most occur in May or November.
- **No announced qualifying consignment**: The Christie's March 5, 2026 Surreal sale has top lot ~£9.5M. No other sale with $100M+ painting has been announced.
- **Market context**: The art market has softened since 2022 peak. Sotheby's lost $248M in 2024. However, the November 2025 Klimt sale at $236.4M shows ultra-high-end demand exists.
- **Timing**: The major spring New York sales (where $100M+ lots most commonly appear) are typically in early-to-mid May, after the deadline.
- **Unannounced consignments**: It's possible but unlikely that a $100M+ painting would be consigned and sold before May 1 without prior announcement.
- **Christie's March 2026 London sale**: Already announced with no qualifying lots.

The combination of a narrow window, no announced qualifying lots, and the typical timing of major spring sales (post-May 1) points to a relatively low probability. I estimate approximately 12-18%.

Outside view calibration:

The annual base rate of ~80% needs to be adjusted heavily for the narrow 65-day window and the fact that the main spring sales fall after May 1. If $100M+ sales are roughly uniformly distributed across ~4 major sale weeks per year (2 in May, 2 in November), the probability of one occurring in this specific pre-May window would be roughly 80% × (1-2 qualifying sale weeks before May 1 out of ~8 total) ≈ 80% × 15-20% ≈ 12-16%. The absence of any announced qualifying consignment further suppresses this. However, there's always a non-trivial chance of an unannounced special sale or early consignment. I'll set my estimate at approximately 13%.

Outside View Prediction:
13%
