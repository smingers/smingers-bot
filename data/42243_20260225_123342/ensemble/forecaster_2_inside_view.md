Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Christie's 2017 Salvator Mundi press release** – Primary source, high quality. Historical document confirming a $450.3M sale. Not relevant to the resolution window (pre-2026), but establishes that Christie's does announce nine-figure sales via press releases.

2. **The Art Newspaper (Nov 2017)** – Reputable specialist publication. Historical context only. No forward-looking relevance.

3. **The Guardian (Nov 2017)** – Reputable mainstream outlet. Historical record of the $450.3M Salvator Mundi sale. No forward-looking relevance.

4. **The Art Newspaper (Sept 2025)** – Reputable specialist publication. Notes Sotheby's 23% sales drop in 2024 and new Breuer Building opening. Moderate quality signal of soft market conditions. Factual.

5. **The Guardian (Dec 2025)** – Reputable outlet. Covers a Picasso charity raffle at Christie's Paris (April 2026), which explicitly does NOT qualify under resolution criteria. Incidentally confirms Picasso works "consistently fetch $100M+" historically, but this is a general opinion, not a specific sale.

6. **AskNews: Francis Bacon self-portrait at Sotheby's (Feb 25, 2026)** – Arabic-language source (Youm7), published today. Reports a Bacon self-portrait estimated at £8-12M for a March 4, 2026 Sotheby's London sale. Well below $100M threshold. Factual, relevant to current auction calendar.

7. **AskNews: Kandinsky at Christie's (~£15M estimate)** – Forbes Russia, Feb 25, 2026. Christie's offering a Kandinsky abstract at ~£15M. Far below $100M. Factual, current.

8. **AskNews: New York Post on fall 2025 auctions (Dec 14, 2025)** – Mainstream outlet. Reports Klimt "Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer" sold for $236.4M at Sotheby's in November 2025. **This is a past event (November 2025), before the resolution window opens (Feb 25, 2026).** Does not count toward resolution.

9. **AskNews: CNN Arabic on Sotheby's Klimt sale (Nov 27, 2025)** – Reputable outlet. Confirms $236.4M Klimt sale at Sotheby's November 2025. Again, pre-resolution window. Does not count.

10. **AskNews: Artsy on 16 auction records in November 2025 (Nov 24, 2025)** – Reputable specialist outlet. Confirms Klimt $236.4M sale in November 2025. Pre-resolution window.

11. **AskNews: CNN International on Klimt sale (Nov 19, 2025)** – Primary coverage of the Klimt sale. Pre-resolution window.

12. **AskNews: Sotheby's de Gunzburg collection (Feb 23, 2026)** – Wallpaper*, reputable design/art publication. Reports Sotheby's April 22, 2026 design auction with top estimate $43M total. The Rothko painting in the May auctions is estimated at $10-15M. No individual painting near $100M.

13. **AskNews: Art sales decline article (Feb 23, 2026)** – Korean outlet (NEWSIS). Reports fine art sales fell from $10.8B (2022) to $7.04B (2025). Structural headwinds for the art market. Moderate quality signal.

14. **AskNews: Artnet on mid-season sales / Lauder Klimts (Oct 11, 2025)** – Artnet News, highly reputable specialist outlet. Reports art market down 8.8% H1 2025. The Klimt sale (which occurred in November 2025) is described as the "Holy Grail" test. This is pre-resolution window context.

15. **AskNews: Hong Kong fall auctions (Oct 2025)** – Multiple sources. Total $136.3M across all three houses combined, no individual painting near $100M. Confirms soft Asian market.

16. **AskNews: Sotheby's de Jonnèsberg collection (Feb 24, 2026)** – Arabic source. Sotheby's April/May auctions with total estimate $67-99M across ~135 works. Top individual painting (Rothko) at $10-15M. No single painting near $100M.

17. **Deep Research Analysis** – Synthesized finding: The only $100M+ painting sale since 2025 was the Klimt in November 2025, which is **before** the resolution window. No announced consignments for the Feb 25 – Apr 30, 2026 window.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence against resolution:**
- The Klimt $236.4M sale occurred in November 2025, **before** the resolution window opens (Feb 25, 2026). This is confirmed by multiple independent, reputable sources (CNN, Artsy, Artnet, New York Post). This means the most significant recent nine-figure sale does NOT count.
- Current auction calendars (as of Feb 25, 2026) show no announced paintings near $100M: Bacon at £8-12M (Sotheby's March 4), Kandinsky at ~£15M (Christie's), de Gunzburg collection with top painting at $10-15M (Sotheby's May). These are confirmed by multiple current sources.
- Art market structural decline: fine art sales fell from $10.8B (2022) to $7.04B (2025), a 35% decline. This is confirmed by multiple sources and represents a strong structural headwind.
- Historical seasonality: Spring (Jan-Apr) is the weakest season for nine-figure sales. The outside view analysis found only 1/16 such windows produced a $100M+ painting sale.

**Moderate evidence against resolution:**
- Sotheby's sales dropped 23% in 2024. Auction houses are risk-averse about guaranteeing nine-figure lots in a soft market.
- The shift toward private sales (Christie's +41%, Sotheby's +17% in 2024) suggests ultra-high-value works may bypass public auction.

**Weak evidence for resolution:**
- The art market showed a strong November 2025 rebound ($2.2B in fall NY sales), suggesting some appetite for high-value works. However, this is past the resolution window.
- The Charity Picasso raffle at Christie's Paris (April 14, 2026) involves a Christie's venue but is not a qualifying public auction.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window is **Feb 25 – Apr 30, 2026: approximately 64 days**. 

- **If halved (~32 days, ending ~March 29):** Only the Sotheby's London March 4 sale (Bacon, £8-12M) and a few smaller sales would fall within scope. Probability would drop to ~2-3%.
- **If doubled (~128 days, ending ~July 1):** Would capture the May New York evening sales, which historically are the primary venue for nine-figure results. Probability would rise to perhaps 15-20%, as May is the peak season for ultra-high-value sales.

The current 64-day window is almost entirely in the "off-season" for nine-figure sales, with the May New York sales (the most likely venue) falling just outside the window.

**(d) Justification**

Starting from the outside view base rate of **5%** (1/16 Jan-Apr windows produced a $100M+ painting sale, adjusted for current lack of announcements):

**Factors pushing DOWN:**
1. No announced consignments near $100M for the window (strong evidence, -2 ppt): Current auction calendars show nothing close to nine figures through April 30.
2. Structural market decline (-1 ppt): 35% drop in fine art sales 2022-2025 reduces likelihood of ultra-high-value consignments.
3. The major nine-figure sale (Klimt $236.4M) already occurred in November 2025, just before the window, reducing the probability of another one so soon (-1 ppt).

**Factors pushing UP:**
1. Fat-tail possibility of an unannounced single-lot sale (+0.5 ppt): Houses can organize special sales with 4-6 weeks notice.
2. November 2025 market rebound suggests some collector confidence (+0.5 ppt).

**Net adjustment:** -3 ppt from 5% = ~2%.

However, I should be careful not to over-adjust. The base rate of 5% already incorporates the historical rarity of spring nine-figure sales. The current evidence (no announced consignments, soft market, seasonality) is consistent with the reference class. I'll settle at **3%** to account for the small but non-negligible possibility of an unannounced surprise sale.

**Probability Calibration**

The resolution criteria requires a painting sold at public auction for ≥$100M at Christie's, Sotheby's, or Phillips, announced before May 1, 2026. The resolution window is Feb 25 – Apr 30, 2026.

Key facts:
- No paintings near $100M are currently announced for this window
- Historical base rate for this window type: ~6%
- Current market conditions are soft
- The most recent nine-figure sale (Klimt, $236.4M) occurred just before the window opens
- Spring is historically the weakest season for nine-figure sales

The probability should be low but not negligible. I'll set it at **3%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Christie's, Sotheby's, or Phillips publicly report a painting selling for ≥$100M at public auction between Feb 25 and Apr 30, 2026?

2. **Outside view base rate:** 5% (1/16 Jan-Apr windows historically produced such a result). Final prediction of 3% is slightly below this, justified by current lack of announcements and soft market.

3. **Consistency check:** "3 out of 100 times, a painting sells for ≥$100M at one of these three houses in this 64-day window." This aligns with the evidence: historically rare, currently no announced consignments.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - No announced $100M+ consignments for the window (confirmed by multiple current sources) ✓
   - Historical spring seasonality: only 1/16 such windows produced a qualifying sale ✓
   - Art market structural decline 2022-2025 (35% drop, confirmed by multiple sources) ✓
   - Klimt $236.4M sale already occurred in November 2025, before the window ✓

5. **Blind-spot:** A major collector could consign a trophy work for a special single-lot sale in March or April 2026 with little advance notice (like Salvator Mundi in 2017). This could push probability to ~10-15%, but given current market conditions and absence of rumors, this seems unlikely.

6. **Status quo:** No qualifying sale has been announced. The status quo is "no resolution." The world changes slowly; absent a surprise announcement, this resolves No.

Probability: 3%
