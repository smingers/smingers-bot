Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

- **Christie's press releases page**: Non-functional extraction; no usable content. Low utility.
- **Phillips press page**: Structural/navigational only; no actual press releases extracted. Low utility.
- **Barnebys article (Aug 2025)**: Educational explainer on hammer price vs. buyer's premium. High quality for definitional purposes; not directly relevant to resolution.
- **CultureType (May 2017)**: Historical record of Basquiat's $110.5M sale at Sotheby's in 2017. Reliable historical document.
- **Wikipedia - List of most expensive paintings**: Useful reference for historical nine-figure sales. Generally reliable for well-documented facts, though tables were incompletely extracted.
- **Verus Art blog**: Commercial source selling reproductions; confirms Monet's Meules sold for $110.7M at Sotheby's in 2019. Moderate reliability; the specific fact is corroborated elsewhere.
- **Christie's press release (April 2025)**: Official source announcing Warhol's Big Electric Chair at ~$30M estimate. High quality; confirms no nine-figure lot in that sale.
- **Christie's editorial (Nov 2025)**: Official Christie's content showing November 2025 results with highest at ~$20M. High quality; confirms no $100M+ result in that specific sale.
- **Christie's press release (March 2026 Surreal sale)**: Official announcement; highest estimate ~£9.5M, well below threshold. High quality.
- **Agent Report**: Comprehensive synthesis of $80M+ auction results since 2010. Identifies key data points including Klimt's Elisabeth Lederer at $236.4M (Nov 2025) and Magritte's L'empire des lumières at $121.2M (2024). Moderate-to-high quality as a synthesis; individual claims should be verified but are internally consistent. The agent's probability estimate of 25-40% is an opinion from a non-identifiable expert (AI agent), so I'll treat it as a rough reference rather than authoritative.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are applicable:

1. **Annual frequency of $100M+ painting sales (2013-2025)**: The agent report identifies roughly 1-3 such sales per year since 2013. Over ~12 years, approximately 15 confirmed $100M+ sales occurred, averaging ~1.25/year. This is the most relevant base rate.

2. **Spring auction season (Jan-April) specifically**: Major spring New York sales typically occur in May, meaning the pre-May 1 window captures only early spring sales, special evening sales, or London/Hong Kong sales. Historically, some $100M+ sales have occurred in this window (e.g., Picasso's Les Femmes d'Alger sold May 11, 2015 - just after the deadline; Basquiat sold May 18, 2017 - also after). The May sales are typically the biggest spring events, and they fall AFTER the May 1 deadline.

3. **Probability in any given ~2-month window**: If ~1.25 sales/year occur uniformly distributed, the probability in a ~2-month window (Feb 25 - May 1 = ~65 days) would be approximately 1 - e^(-1.25 × 65/365) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.222) ≈ 20%. However, sales are NOT uniformly distributed - they cluster in May and November.

The most suitable reference class is the spring pre-May window specifically, which historically captures fewer major sales than the May or November windows.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- Resolution window: February 25, 2026 to May 1, 2026 (~65 days)
- This window covers: London March sales (Christie's Surreal sale announced, no $100M+ lots), potential Hong Kong spring sales, and any early New York sales
- The major New York spring marquee week typically occurs in mid-to-late May, AFTER the deadline
- London spring sales (March) have produced some major results but rarely nine-figure ones
- Hong Kong spring sales (typically April) have occasionally produced large results but rarely $100M+
- The November 2025 season consumed the most prominent trophy consignments (Klimt Elisabeth Lederer at $236.4M)
- No $100M+ consignment for spring 2026 has been publicly announced as of the question opening date

Historical pattern: Looking at when $100M+ sales occurred:
- May 2015 (Picasso, Modigliani) - after May 1
- Nov 2013, Nov 2017, Nov 2018, Nov 2019, Nov 2022, Nov 2023, Nov 2024, Nov 2025 - all fall
- The Feb-April window has very few historical $100M+ sales

**(d) Justification**

The question asks about a narrow ~65-day window that historically captures very few $100M+ painting sales. The major auction events (New York spring marquee week) fall in mid-to-late May, after the deadline. The fall 2025 season already consumed the most prominent available consignments. No qualifying lot has been announced for the resolution window.

Key factors favoring YES:
- Ultra-high-end demand remains active (Klimt at $236.4M in Nov 2025)
- Christie's and Sotheby's actively compete for trophy consignments
- Unannounced consignments can emerge close to sale dates
- Some London or Hong Kong spring sales could produce surprise results

Key factors favoring NO:
- The pre-May 1 window historically captures very few $100M+ sales
- No qualifying consignment announced
- Art market in softer phase
- Major trophy consignments already sold in fall 2025
- The Christie's March 2026 Surreal sale has no lots near $100M
- Phillips rarely handles $100M+ lots

The base rate for this specific window (Feb 25 - May 1) is quite low - perhaps 1-2 such sales have ever occurred in this window historically (if any). The absence of announced qualifying lots further reduces probability.

Outside view calibration:

The annual base rate of ~1.25 $100M+ sales/year, applied to a 65-day window, gives ~20% if uniformly distributed. However, the seasonal clustering strongly away from this window (toward May and November) reduces this substantially - perhaps to 8-12%. The absence of any announced qualifying consignment further reduces it. The agent's estimate of 25-40% seems too high given the specific timing constraints and lack of announced lots.

I'll calibrate at approximately 12%, reflecting:
- Low historical frequency of $100M+ sales in the Feb-April window
- No announced qualifying consignment
- Active market but post-peak season
- Small but real possibility of surprise consignment or early spring sale

Outside View Prediction:
12%
