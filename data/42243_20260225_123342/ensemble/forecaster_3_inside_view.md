Analysis:
1) Resolution-criteria alignment (paraphrase)
This resolves YES if, between Feb 25, 2026 and May 1, 2026, Christie’s/Sotheby’s/Phillips publicly reports (press release/official results) a *painting* sold at *public auction* for ≥US$100M (incl. premium if split).

(a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; date; fact vs opinion)
- Christie's press release on *Salvator Mundi* (Oct 2017): Pre-sale announcement with “in the region of $100m” estimate. High-quality primary source but far outside window; not a result. (Facts: estimate, sale plan. Opinions: “Holy Grail” type quotes.)
- The Art Newspaper (Nov 2017) *Salvator Mundi* preview: Secondary journalism; high quality; outside window; includes guarantee and estimate. (Facts: guarantee, estimate, placement in sale. Opinions: authenticity debate.)
- The Guardian (Nov 2017) *Salvator Mundi* result: Secondary; reputable; outside window; confirms $450.3m incl premium. (Facts: sale price, hammer, context. Opinions: narrative framing.)
- The Art Newspaper (Sep 2025) Sotheby’s Breuer building / infrastructure: Reputable; indirect relevance; outside window. (Facts: opening timing, sales drop. Opinions: interpretive market framing.)
- The Guardian (Dec 31, 2025) Picasso charity raffle: Reputable; near window but not relevant (raffle ≠ public auction sale). (Facts: raffle mechanics. Opinions: none material.)
- Triblive page blocked: No usable content.
AskNews items (mixed quality; many are recycled background or non-core):
- Youm7 (Feb 25, 2026) Bacon self-portrait estimate £8–12m: Low direct relevance (far below $100m; also describes a March 4, 2024 sale—historical). Medium-low reliability for details; not decision-relevant.
- Forbes.ru (Feb 25, 2026) mentions Christie's Kandinsky est. £15m: Low relevance; below threshold; medium source quality.
- Artnet News (Feb 24, 2026) Rembrandt prints rediscovery: Reputable but irrelevant (prints; not $100m painting).
- Kommersant/RBC (Feb 24, 2026) Moscow Auction House: Not one of the three houses; irrelevant to criteria.
- Youm7 / Wallpaper* (Feb 23–24, 2026) Sotheby’s design auction Apr 22, 2026: Reputable (Wallpaper*) / lower (Youm7); relevant mainly by showing April calendar focus is *design*, and paintings referenced are estimated tens of millions at most. (Facts: sale date, estimates. Opinions: “could be most valuable design sale”.)
- Hankyung (Feb 24, 2026) private vs auction trend: General trend piece; moderate relevance (more private sales reduces auction chances). (Facts: claimed private sale growth; needs cautious acceptance. Opinions: strategic interpretation.)
- Newsis (Feb 23, 2026) “structural shift” toward luxury: Moderate relevance; suggests fine-art auction volume down, potentially fewer trophy paintings offered at auction. (Facts: category revenue shares; should be broadly plausible but still secondary reporting. Opinions: “structural shift” framing.)
- CNN (Nov 19, 2025), Artsy (Nov 24, 2025), CNN Arabic (Nov 27, 2025), NY Post (Dec 14, 2025) on Klimt “Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer” at $236.4m: High (CNN/Artsy) to low (NY Post) reliability; key factual claim is a recent nine-figure painting auction—but **outside** the resolution window. Still informative about market capacity and Sotheby’s willingness to land trophy consignments. (Facts: reported price/date; Opinions: market “rebound” narratives.)

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- **Seasonality / calendar structure**: The biggest spring “marquee” New York evening sales tend to occur in **mid-to-late May**, and this question’s window ends **May 1**. This structural timing strongly suppresses the chance of a $100m+ *painting* result occurring in-window.

Moderate evidence
- **No identified/announced $100m+ painting consignment for Mar–Apr 2026** in the provided current items; the highlighted upcoming Sotheby’s event is an **April 22 design auction** with non-nine-figure estimates. Lack of “trophy lot” chatter by late Feb is moderately informative because auction houses usually market nine-figure lots weeks in advance.
- **Market mix shifting to private sales/luxury categories** (Newsis + Hankyung trend claims): if true, it modestly reduces probability that a seller chooses public auction for a $100m+ painting in this short window.

Weak evidence
- **Recent proof of capability** (Nov 2025 Klimt $236.4m): supports that the market *can* clear $100m+ at auction, but does little to show it will happen specifically in the next ~65 days and before May 1.
- Various sub-$100m estimates (Bacon, Kandinsky, etc.): weakly confirm that the visible pipeline (in these sources) skews far below the threshold.

Net: evidence tilts to NO versus the outside-view baseline, mainly due to the hard calendar constraint plus absence of a flagged trophy consignment.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: **65 days** (Feb 25 → May 1, 2026).
- If halved to ~32 days: probability drops materially because there’s even less time for (i) a trophy consignment to surface, (ii) marketing, and (iii) a scheduled public evening sale; I’d expect roughly **~4–5%**.
- If doubled to ~130 days (to early July 2026): probability rises sharply because it would include the **May New York marquee sales** and post-May reporting; I’d expect roughly **~25–35%** (still not guaranteed, but much closer to annualized odds given clustering around May/Nov).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside-view base rate)
Outside view base rate given: **12%** for a $100m+ painting auction result reported by the big three in this specific pre-May-1 spring window.

Inside view adjustments:
- Downward: The dominant causal factor is the **auction calendar**. The window excludes the typical May “peak” by cutting off at May 1. That makes the reference class “any 65-day period” overly generous; this is a *particularly* dry segment for nine-figure painting auctions.
- Downward: By late February, nine-figure trophy lots are usually being teased/announced for spring; in the provided material, the concrete, dated Sotheby’s April event is design-focused and the cited painting estimates are far below $100m.
- Slight upward (small): The Nov 2025 Klimt result suggests there is still depth of demand at the very top, so a surprise private-collector consignment *could* be pushed through for a late-March/April London/Paris/HK/New York event. But this is more a “possible” than “probable” driver.

Overall: enough negative, window-specific structure exists to move modestly below 12%, but not to near-zero because (i) surprise consignments happen, (ii) a single lot suffices, (iii) Sotheby’s/Christie’s do occasionally stage special one-lot or tightly curated sales.

Probability calibration
- Status quo (nothing special announced; normal scheduling): NO.
- I move from **12% → 9%** reflecting (1) the May cutoff excluding the major spring week, and (2) no visible trophy pipeline in the cited current items, partially offset by (3) demonstrated recent nine-figure demand.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: YES if Christie’s/Sotheby’s/Phillips officially reports a public auction sale of a *painting* for ≥$100m between Feb 25, 2026 and May 1, 2026.
2) Outside view base rate: 12%.
3) Consistency line: “In 9 out of 100 similar windows, a big-three auction house reports a ≥$100m painting sale before May 1, 2026.”
4) Key evidence (3–5):
   - May New York marquee week usually occurs after May 1 (structural timing).
   - No specific announced/flagged ≥$100m painting consignment for Mar–Apr 2026 in provided sources.
   - Trend claims: more private sales/luxury focus may reduce trophy paintings routed via public auction.
   - Recent Nov 2025 $236m Klimt shows top-end demand exists (weakly supportive).
5) Blind spot: A *quietly consigned* trophy (Picasso/Warhol/Rothko/Klimt-level) announced late and sold in a special April sale (NY/London/HK) at/over $100m; that would push probability upward (toward ~15–20%).
6) Status quo outcome: With no late-breaking trophy lot, the window likely passes without a ≥$100m painting auction result.

Probability: 9%
