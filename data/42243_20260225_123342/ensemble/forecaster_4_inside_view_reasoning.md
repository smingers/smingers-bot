**Considering auction forecasts**

I'm looking to create a forecast about whether Christie's, Sotheby's, or Phillips will report a painting sale of at least $100 million before May 1, 2026. Today’s date is February 25, 2026, which gives me a 65-day window for this prediction. It’s important to note that since the Klimt painting was sold in November 2025, it doesn’t count for this forecast since it falls outside my resolution window. I'll predict if another sale will occur within this timeframe.**Evaluating auction predictions**

I need to look at the auction announcements for spring 2026. May auctions usually start early but end before May 1, which means there's a good chance the big sales will occur after my prediction window. The London sales in March might include Old Masters or Impressionists, but historically, $100 million+ sales in March are rare. There was one significant sculpture sale, but no painting reached that milestone. Given the evidence, I should adjust my expectations: the probability seems low, especially since no trophy-level paintings have been announced for March or April.**Analyzing auction probabilities**

The art market has been soft from 2024 to 2025, yet noteworthy sales like the $236 million Klimt in late 2025 indicate potential for trophy lots, though supply may be scarce. Seasonal trends show top sales in March or early April rarely exceed $100 million. Notable past sales, like the Klimt in June, and the Giacometti sculpture in February, emphasize this rarity. 

Upcoming events, including possible single-owner collections, might influence sales, but historical data suggests low likelihood for $100 million sales in this timeframe. Therefore, I’m adjusting the probability to about 6%, acknowledging the limited supply and varying timelines. I'll finalize this analysis with all supporting evidence.
