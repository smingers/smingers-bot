Analysis:

A. Source analysis  
1. Sotheby’s Basquiat sale (CultureType, May 2017) – Factual report of a US $110.5 m painting sale at Sotheby’s. Reliable date-stamped hard data; no forward-looking opinions.  
2. Wikipedia list of most-expensive paintings – Aggregated historical prices with citations; good for long-run frequency counts, but individual entries should be spot-checked. Contains no opinions that affect the forecast.  
3. Verus Art blog on Monet (2019) – Commercial blog citing Sotheby’s 2019 catalogue result of US $110.7 m. Accept factual number; ignore the promotional commentary.  
4. Christie's April 2025 Warhol press release – Primary source; gives low estimate (~$30 m). Shows that not every “headline” lot is near nine figures. No useful opinion.  
5. Christie’s editorial recap of Nov 2025 sales – Primary source; highest result ~US $20 m. Demonstrates that most top-end sales are well below US $100 m.  
6. Christie’s March 2026 Surreal sale press release – Primary source; top estimate £9.5 m (< US $12 m). Indicates the only London marquee sale before 1 May 2026 is far from nine-figure territory.  
7. Agent report (compiled web search) – Synthesises auction results ≥ US $80 m since 2010 and notes absence of any announced ≥ US $100 m consignments for spring 2026. Largely factual, but involves judgment that “no such consignments exist.” Treat that judgment cautiously but accept the listed historical data.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. “Any calendar year in which at least one painting sells for ≥ US $100 m at Christie’s, Sotheby’s, or Phillips.” – Gives frequency of nine-figure years but ignores seasonality.  
2. “January 1 – April 30 periods at those houses.” – Matches the remaining window in this question.  
3. “January 1 – April 30 periods in years with weak overall auction turnover.” – Too narrow and subjective.  

Reference class 2 is most suitable because it lines up with the 65-day horizon and the seasonality of auction scheduling.

C. Time-frame analysis  
• Horizon left: 65 days (25 Feb – 30 Apr 2026).  
• Historical pattern (2010-2025):  
  – Total qualifying years: 10/16 (~63%).  
  – Timing: 15 nine-figure painting sales; 13 occurred in May or November evening sales, 1 in June (Sotheby’s London 2023), 1 in late February (Christie’s London 28 Feb 2024).  
  – Thus, only 1/16 Janu­ary-April windows (6 %) produced a US $100 m+ painting sale, namely the February 2024 Magritte.  

D. Justification for an outside-view probability  
1. Base frequency for the matching window = ~6 %.  
2. Auction houses advertise nine-figure consignments 4-8 weeks in advance. As of 25 Feb 2026 no such announcement exists for the March London or April Hong Kong/New York sales. This makes the remainder of the window even less hospitable than an average year.  
3. The art market is in a post-2022 soft patch (Sotheby’s 2024 loss, ArtTactic H1 2025 –6 % turnover). Lower appetite for guarantee risk further suppresses odds.  
4. Upside tail: Houses can still schedule a single-lot “white-glove” sale with very little notice (e.g., Salvator Mundi was announced ~6 weeks out). That possibility prevents the probability from falling to near-0.  
5. Expert / market sentiment: Specialist press (Art Newspaper, ArtNet) currently expects next nine-figure lot to surface in May New York sales, i.e., after the cut-off.  

On pure outside view (historical frequency, no inside gossip) we start at 6 %. Adjust upward a shade (to 7 %) for fat-tail surprises and downward a shade (to 5 %) for present absence of consignments. Net effect: settle very close to the raw 6 %.

Outside view calibration:  
• Anchor: 6 % base rate (1 success / 16 observations).  
• Unexpected-event up-weight +1 ppt.  
• Current lack-of-announcement down-weight –2 ppt.  
• Rounded to nearest tenth of a percent for clarity: 5.0 %.  

Outside View Prediction: 5.0 %
