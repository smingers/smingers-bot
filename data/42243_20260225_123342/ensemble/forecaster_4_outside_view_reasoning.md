**Analyzing auction predictions**

I'm considering whether a public auction sale of a painting for at least $100 million will happen before May 1, 2026. That gives me a little over two months, and I need to take a historical view by evaluating past occurrences. 

First, I’ll look at how many times this has happened in the last 16 years. I see that in 2010, Picasso sold for $106.5 million at Christie's. I’ll need to verify further years for similar sales. Let's keep going!**Reflecting on historical sales**

In the years from 2014 to 2025, I found several significant sales of paintings exceeding $100 million. In 2014, there wasn't one, but in 2015, there were two at Christie's. Jumping ahead, I noted remarkable sales in subsequent years like Basquiat in 2017 and various notable pieces through 2025. 

Overall, it looks like there have been 10 years with sales over $100 million. However, most high-value auctions tend to happen in May or November. For our timeframe, I’ll focus on sales that might be happening in March or April instead.**Reviewing sale dates**

I'm analyzing the historical dates for nine-figure painting sales to understand their timing. For instance, Picasso's "Nude, Green Leaves" sold on May 4, 2010, and there were other notable sales in May, such as Warhol's works in 2022 and Basquiat's in 2017. 

Notably, "Magritte" might qualify as it sold on February 28, 2024, prior to May 1, but most sales occur after this date. Given that historically only about 10% of sales happen before May across ten years, the likelihood of another early-year sale seems quite low, especially with nothing announced for 2025.**Estimating auction probabilities**

With only two months remaining, I think the probability of a nine-figure painting sale occurring is likely around 5%. Adjusting for new information, like confirmed sales in March and April without any higher-than-$100 million consignments, I might estimate the likelihood at only 2-3%. 

I still want to keep my base estimate at about 10%, but will likely adjust it to an 8% probability using historical trends. Let’s craft this analysis into a final answer based on these evaluations.
