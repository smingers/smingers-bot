**Adjusting forecast analysis**

I need to craft a professional forecaster analysis and finalize the probability—currently at 5.6%. Given new information, I should adjust this. As of February 25, 2026, I'm aiming for a nine-figure painting sale at Christie's, Sotheby's, or Phillips by May 1, 2026, but there are no high-value consignments announced for March-April. The last nine-figure sale was a Klimt in November 2025, which doesn’t count since it’s before the resolution window. So, I’ll focus on events in the next 65 days.**Analyzing sale probability**

I’m focusing on key factors affecting the probability of a nine-figure painting sale. Typically, these sales are rare in March-April, with only one known case in March 2024, which I doubt as a reliable precedent. I have a 65-day window, but there are no announced high-value paintings for upcoming auctions. Any potential sales would require early announcements, and with the recent nine-figure sale in November 2025, the pipeline might be limited. I’m concluding with a probability of 4%, based on strong and moderate evidence, and crafting my final analysis.
