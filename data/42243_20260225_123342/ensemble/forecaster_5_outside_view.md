Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  

1. Christies and Phillips press‐release pages (2026-02-25 crawls) – Contain only cookie / login text, no data.  Reliability: not useful.  Factual content: none.  
2. Barnebys “Hammer price vs Buyer’s premium” explainer (Aug 2025) – Background on how auction houses report results.  Fact-based, not opinion; moderately reliable for mechanics, irrelevant for probabilities.  
3. CultureType report on Basquiat “Untitled” $110.5 M sale (May 2017) – Straight news article, primary facts taken from Sotheby’s.  High factual reliability, dated.  
4. Wikipedia “List of most expensive paintings” (continually updated, snapshot ≥ 2025) – Aggregated secondary compilation; generally reliable but should be cross-checked.  Useful for long-run frequency.  
5. VerusArt blog on Monet “Meules” $110.7 M (2019) – Commercial blog quoting Sotheby’s result.  Facts verifiable elsewhere; moderate reliability.  
6. Christies press release on Warhol “Big Electric Chair” (Apr 2025) – Primary source, high reliability; shows sub-$100 M consignments.  
7. Christies editorial on Nov 2025 sales – Primary figures from sale results, high reliability; no nine-figure paintings.  
8. Christies press release on March 2026 “Art of the Surreal” sale – Primary source; top estimate well below $100 M.  
9. Agent report (LLM synthesis) – Collates public records of ≥ $80 M sales 2010-25 and notes lack of announced $100 M consignments for spring 2026.  Factual items largely check out against public databases, but treat as secondary / unverified.  

In all of these, the only opinions are market commentary (“demand remains strong”, etc.); I ignore those for the outside view.

(b)  Reference class analysis  

Candidate reference classes:  
1. “Calendar years in which any of Christie’s, Sotheby’s or Phillips sold a painting ≥ $100 M.”  
2. “Two-month windows (Mar 1–Apr 30) in which such a sale occurred.”  
3. “Any sale season prior to the mid-May New York evening sales.”

Suitability: The forecasting window is 25 Feb – 1 May 2026 (≈ 66 days).  Class 2 matches both the houses involved and the season length, so I adopt it.

Empirical count (2010-2025, 16 years, 32 Mar–Apr windows):  
• Nine-figure painting auctions in Mar–Apr: only one confirmed case – René Magritte, L’empire des lumières, Sotheby’s London 2 Mar 2024 (US $121 M).  
Base rate ≈ 1 / 32 ≈ 3.1 %.  (If the Magritte is dated 2022 rather than 2024 the count is the same: one.)

For robustness, check Class 1: 10 of 16 years (62 %) eventually produced at least one nine-figure painting, but almost all happened in May or November.  Seasonality is pronounced; applying the annual rate to a pre-May-1 cut-off would badly over-state the chance.

(c)  Time-frame analysis  

• Days until deadline: 66.  
• Auction schedule in that window:  
  – London/Paris March marquee sales (Christie’s, Sotheby’s)  
  – Hong Kong Modern & Contemporary April sales (both houses)  
  None of the catalogues released so far list a $100 M-level lot; high-value works are normally publicised 4-8 weeks in advance for marketing.  
• The next New York evening sales traditionally fall between 8–15 May – just outside resolution window.

Historical pattern: Only 1 nine-figure painting has ever sold before 1 May; 10+ have sold shortly after 1 May.  Therefore the timing alone suppresses probability.

(d)  Justification  

Positive factors for YES:  
• Trophy demand proved resilient in Nov 2025 (Klimt $236 M).  
• Unannounced single-lot “white-glove” events can be scheduled on short notice (e.g., Salvator Mundi was announced 6 weeks ahead of the Nov 2017 sale).

Negative factors:  
• No house has yet announced a likely nine-figure painting for March–April 2026, and we are already within the normal marketing lead-time.  
• Seasonality: 90 %+ of such results occur in May or November.  
• The huge Lauder and Weis collections have just been absorbed; consignor pipeline may be temporarily thin.  
• Macroeconomic backdrop: softening auction turnover in 2024–25 (-6 % 1H 2025 per ArtTactic) may make houses cautious about exposing nine-figure guarantees outside peak weeks.

Taking the 3 % raw base-rate for a Mar–Apr window, I adjust slightly upward to account for the long-term rise in frequency (1 sale in the first 12 years of the reference period vs one in the last two), and for the small but real possibility of a late “surprise” consignment.  I also shade downward for the absence of any rumours to date.

Outside view calibration:

Base probability (Mar–Apr window 2010-25): 3 %.  
Trend adjustment (+1.5  pp) → 4.5 %.  
Late-announcement allowance (+2 pp) → 6.5 %.  
“Soft market” discount (-1 pp) → 5.5 %.  

Round to the nearest tenth of a percent to avoid false precision: 5.6 %.

Outside View Prediction:
5.6 %
