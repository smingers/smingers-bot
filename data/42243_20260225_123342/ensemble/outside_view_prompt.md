You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will Christie’s, Sotheby’s, or Phillips report a public auction sale of a painting for at least US$100 million before May 1, 2026?

Question background:
This tracks whether the ultra-high end of the fine-art auction market produces another nine-figure painting result.

`{"format":"bot_tournament_question","info":{"hash_id":"69bd4704b33494ef","sheet_id":268.1}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves to yes if, before May 1, 2026, Christie’s, Sotheby’s, or Phillips publishes an official result or press release stating that a painting sold at public auction for at least US\$100,000,000. This question resolves to no otherwise. Primary sources are: [https://press.christies.com/section/press-releases](https://press.christies.com/section/press-releases), [https://www.sothebys.com/en/press](https://www.sothebys.com/en/press), and [https://www.phillips.com/press](https://www.phillips.com/press)  The question may also resolve based on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions)

Additional fine-print:
Only public auction sales count. The work must be a painting, and the amount must meet or exceed US\$100,000,000 as reported by the auction house. Private sales do not count.

If a single sale price is reported by the auction house, then that price will be used for resolution. If the auction house reports hammer prices and buyer's fees (explained [here](https://www.barnebys.com/blog/auctions-101-hammer-price-vs.-buyers-premium)) separately, then both will be summed for resolution.&#x20;

For purposes of this question, a “painting” is a work categorized by the auction house as a painting in its official sale listing, press release, or other public pronouncements.

Question metadata:

## Summary: Auctions 101 – Hammer Price vs. Buyer's Premium (Barnebys Magazine, August 15, 2025)

This article is an **educational explainer** on auction pricing mechanics, relevant to understanding how final sale prices are calculated and reported.

### Key Facts & Definitions:

- **Hammer price**: The final bid accepted by the auctioneer when the gavel falls; the base sale price of the item.
- **Buyer's premium** (buyer's fee): An additional fee charged *on top of* the hammer price, paid by the buyer and calculated as a percentage of the hammer price. Typically ranges from **20% to 30%**, depending on the auction house and sale category.
- **Tiered structure**: Most major auction houses use a sliding scale where the premium percentage *decreases* as the lot price increases. Example given: 25% on the first $100,000; 20% on the next $400,000; 15% on anything above that.
- **Catalogue estimates** do *not* include the buyer's premium, but **post-sale announced prices often do**, which can make results appear stronger than the hammer price alone suggests.

### Implications Noted:
- Sellers do not receive the buyer's premium portion of the final reported price.
- Buyers should also account for potential taxes (VAT, sales tax) beyond the premium.

## Summary: Christie's Art of the Surreal Evening Sale – March 5, 2026

**Event Overview:**
Christie's announced its 25th edition of *The Art of the Surreal Evening Sale*, part of its 20th/21st Century Art London Marquee Week, scheduled for **March 5, 2026**. The sale is dedicated exclusively to Dada, Surrealism, and related influences — a format Christie's has maintained since 1989.

**Key Lots and Estimates (in GBP):**
- **René Magritte**, *Les grâces naturelles* (c. 1961): **£6,500,000–9,500,000** (top lot)
- **René Magritte**, *Le choeur des sphinges* (1964): **£5,000,000–8,000,000**

- **Pablo Picasso**, *Figure* (1929): **£600,000–800,000**

**Relevance to the Forecasting Question:**
No lot in this sale carries an estimate approaching US$100 million. The highest estimate (Magritte's top lot) is approximately **£9,500,000**, well below the resolution threshold. This sale does **not** appear likely to contribute to a nine-figure painting result.

## 2025 AUCTION SEASON RESULTS (CONFIRMED)

The November 2025 sales were dominated by the **Leonard Lauder Collection** at Sotheby's, which produced the year's most significant results:

1. **Gustav Klimt, Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer (1914–16)** — **$236.4 million** at Sotheby's New York, November 18, 2025. This became the second most expensive painting ever sold at auction and set a new record for modern art. It doubled Klimt's previous record of $108.8M (Lady with a Fan, 2023). (Sources: Sotheby's, Artlyst, TheValue.com)

2. **Gustav Klimt, Blumenwiese (Blooming Meadow, 1908)** — **$86.9 million** at Sotheby's New York, November 2025. Estimated at $80–100M, it sold within range. (Sources: Sotheby's, Artlyst)

3. **Gustav Klimt, Waldabhang bei Unterach am Attersee (1916)** — **~$68–70.8 million** at Sotheby's New York, November 2025. Estimated at $70–90M, it sold below the low estimate. (Sources: Sotheby's, Artlyst)

5. **Pablo Picasso, La Lecture (Marie-Thérèse, 1932)** — **$45.5 million** at Christie's (Weis Collection). (Source: Artlyst)

Christie's 2024 annual report confirmed that **René Magritte's L'empire des lumières** sold for **$121.2M** — the only lot globally to exceed $100M in 2024, from the Mica Ertegun collection. (Source: Christie's press release, December 2024)

## 2026 CONSIGNMENTS EXPECTED ABOVE $100M

Based on the search results, **no specific paintings have been announced for 2026 spring auctions with estimates above $100M** as of the information available. The major 2025 fall season consignments have already been sold (November 2025). Key context:

- The **Lauder Collection** (Sotheby's) and **Weis Collection** (Christie's) were the headline fall 2025 consignments. The Lauder sale's star lot (Klimt's Elisabeth Lederer, est. $150M+) has already sold for $236.4M.
- **Christie's** secured the Weis family collection (80 works, $180M+ collective estimate) and Elaine Wynn estate works ($75M+ collective estimate) for fall 2025 — these have now been sold.
- **Max Berry Collection** (Christie's): A multi-year rollout including American art in January 2026 and Chinese art from March 2026 through 2027, but no individual painting lots are expected to approach $100M. (Source: Observer, October 2025)
- No specific spring 2026 consignments with $100M+ painting estimates have been publicly announced in the available search results.

## MARKET CONTEXT FOR THE FORECASTING QUESTION

**Frequency of $100M+ painting sales:** Since 2013, there has been at least one $100M+ painting sale in most years, with some years producing multiple such results (2015, 2022, 2025). The question asks whether this will occur **before May 1, 2026**, which covers the spring 2026 auction season (typically March–May).

**Historical spring auction pattern:** Major spring sales at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York typically occur in May. The question's deadline of May 1, 2026 means it would need to happen in an early spring sale or a special evening sale before May 1.

**Key risk factors:**
- Global auction sales fell 6.2% in H1 2025 (Art Tactic study cited in The Art Newspaper)
- Sotheby's lost $248M in 2024, more than doubling prior-year losses
- The art market has been in a multi-year softening since the 2022 peak
- The November 2025 sales consumed the most prominent available trophy consignments
- No $100M+ painting consignment for spring 2026 has been publicly announced

**Favorable factors:**
- The Klimt Elisabeth Lederer sale at $236.4M in November 2025 demonstrates ultra-high-end demand remains active
- Christie's and Sotheby's are actively competing for trophy consignments
- The spring 2026 season could still attract unannounced consignments
- Historical base rate: approximately 1–2 $100M+ painting sales per year at major houses

**Assessment:** The question resolves YES if a $100M+ painting sale occurs before May 1, 2026. Given that the major fall 2025 consignments have been sold, the spring 2026 window (January–April 2026) is relatively short and no qualifying consignment has been announced. However, unannounced consignments regularly emerge close to sale dates. The base rate of $100M+ sales occurring in any given year is high (roughly 1–3 per year since 2013), but the specific pre-May 2026 window is narrow and the market is in a softer phase. The probability is moderate but not high — perhaps 25–40% — given the compressed timeframe and absence of announced qualifying lots.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
