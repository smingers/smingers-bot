Private sales do not count.\n\nIf a single sale price is reported by the auction house, then that price will be used for resolution. If the auction house reports hammer prices and buyer's fees (explained [here](https://www.barnebys.com/blog/auctions-101-hammer-price-vs.-buyers-premium)) separately, then both will be summed for resolution.&#x20;\n\nFor purposes of this question, a \u201cpainting\u201d is a work categorized by the auction house as a painting in its official sale listing, press release, or other public pronouncements.",
