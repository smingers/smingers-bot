Analysis:
The question hinges on whether any of the three major auction houses—Christie’s, Sotheby’s, or Phillips—have publicly announced a single painting selling at public auction for US$100 million or more since the question opened and before 1 May 2026.  Key evidence will come from:
• Official auction‐house press releases or post-sale statements.  
• Major art-market and business news outlets covering headline-making sales or previewing upcoming marquee auctions (e.g., New York spring sales, Hong Kong evening sales).  
Therefore, search queries should capture (a) any newly released press statements or articles confirming such a sale, and (b) forward-looking coverage about works expected to break the US$100 million threshold in forthcoming spring 2026 auctions. Combining the house names with “painting”, “$100 million”, “sale” or “auction”, plus filtering to very recent dates, should surface the most relevant news.
