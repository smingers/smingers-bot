Analysis:
To judge the likelihood of another ≥ US$100 million painting sale in the remaining two months before 1 May 2026, it is useful to know:  
• How often Christie's, Sotheby's, or Phillips have achieved nine-figure painting results in the past (frequency, recency, seasonality—usually May & November evening sales).  
• Whether any of the houses have already announced consignments for their spring 2026 marquee auctions that carry estimates in the nine-figure range.  
Searching for recent records, press releases, and spring-2026 sale previews will supply that context.
