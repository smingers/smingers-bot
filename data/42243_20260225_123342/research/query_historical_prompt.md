You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will Christie’s, Sotheby’s, or Phillips report a public auction sale of a painting for at least US$100 million before May 1, 2026?

Question background:
This tracks whether the ultra-high end of the fine-art auction market produces another nine-figure painting result.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves to yes if, before May 1, 2026, Christie’s, Sotheby’s, or Phillips publishes an official result or press release stating that a painting sold at public auction for at least US\$100,000,000. This question resolves to no otherwise. Primary sources are: [https://press.christies.com/section/press-releases](https://press.christies.com/section/press-releases), [https://www.sothebys.com/en/press](https://www.sothebys.com/en/press), and [https://www.phillips.com/press](https://www.phillips.com/press)  The question may also resolve based on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions)

Additional fine-print:
Only public auction sales count. The work must be a painting, and the amount must meet or exceed US\$100,000,000 as reported by the auction house. Private sales do not count.

If a single sale price is reported by the auction house, then that price will be used for resolution. If the auction house reports hammer prices and buyer's fees (explained [here](https://www.barnebys.com/blog/auctions-101-hammer-price-vs.-buyers-premium)) separately, then both will be summed for resolution.&#x20;

For purposes of this question, a “painting” is a work categorized by the auction house as a painting in its official sale listing, press release, or other public pronouncements.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-25. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-25 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
