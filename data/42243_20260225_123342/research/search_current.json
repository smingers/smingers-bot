The oil-on-canvas work, measuring 36 \u00d7 30.5 cm, is estimated to sell for between \u00a38 million and \u00a312 million. It is part of a collection once owned by Joe Lewis, whose family owns Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. The painting is one of Bacon\u2019s most significant self-portraits from the 1970s, a period marked by emotional depth and inner tension, reflected in its intense, visually powerful presence. The artwork is signed and dated on the reverse and has a documented provenance beginning with a direct gift from Bacon to Dr. Paul Bacon in London around 1983, followed by a sale at Sotheby's in 1994, and subsequent ownership by the current collector. It has been exhibited at major institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (1975), the National Museum of Modern Art in Japan (1983), and prominent London galleries. The painting was also featured in the preparatory exhibition 'Francis Bacon: Human Presence' at the National Portrait Gallery, London (2024\u20132025), underscoring its enduring significance in understanding Bacon\u2019s artistic evolution. The work exemplifies Bacon\u2019s use of partial distortion and abstraction to convey existential anxiety, transforming the self-portrait into a visual testimony of inner turmoil.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 07:10 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2026/2/25/%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%87-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%A8%D9%8012-%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%87-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%89-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%86/7315116)\n\n**Speculation on Frida Kahlo and Kandinsky's Legacy Reaches \u00a315M: Art World News**\nA painting by an unknown artist increased in value tenfold at a Sotheby's auction.

The prints, acquired in the early 20th century by Charlotte Meyer\u2019s grandfather, were examined during the 2020 pandemic by experts from the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam, who confirmed their exceptional condition and significant art historical value. Meyer described the experts as 'completely blow away' by the discovery. The prints, once considered unremarkable due to low interest in etchings at the time, are now believed to be highly valuable\u2014evidenced by recent record sales, including Rembrandt\u2019s 1656 work Arnout Tholinx, which sold for \u00a33.1 million ($4.1 million) at Christie\u2019s London, and a chalk study that fetched nearly $18 million at Sotheby\u2019s New York. The prints will be featured in the exhibition 'Rembrandt: From Dark to Light' at the Stedelijk Museum Zutphen, running from March 21 to June 14, 2026. The exhibition will include over 70 works by Rembrandt\u2019s predecessors and followers, pieces from Meyer\u2019s expanded collection, an interactive display on etching techniques, and a multi-sensory experience evoking 17th-century Amsterdam.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 06:32 PM\nSource:[artnet News](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/rembrandt-prints-discovered-2748219)\n\n**Masterpieces from Private Collections Head to Auction in Moscow**\nAn upcoming auction by the Moscow Auction House features significant works of Russian art, with a total estimated value of 1 billion rubles. The top lot is Isaac Levitan\u2019s 1889 painting 'Rising Moon. Village,' valued at 50 million rubles, previously owned by Soviet scientist and inventor Vladimir Mitkovich. The painting was exhibited twice at the Tretyakov Gallery and once at the Russian Museum in the 20th century. Among other highlights is a rare, delicate sketch by Ivan Aivazovsky titled 'Steam Frigate 'Vladimir', depicting the ship that carried Emperor Nicholas I, created during a journey the artist accompanied. The sketch is noted for its mature style despite Aivazovsky\u2019s youth. The auction reflects a growing trend of high-level artworks emerging from private collections, including those of prominent Soviet-era scientists and artists\u2019 heirs. According to Sergey Podstaniitsky, founder of the Moscow Auction House, these works are being brought out of storage due to lack of heirs or financial need. Art historians note increased collector interest in 19th- and 20th-century Russian art, with a December 2025 auction reaching 2.5 billion rubles\u2014surpassing previous records set by Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s. Art critic Dmitry Butkevich suggests the current auction could reach similar values, citing strong provenance, exhibition history, and high-quality works. The international market for Russian art exceeded $330 million in 2025, with a 70% year-on-year increase in sales volume and a rise in average lot price from $65,000 to $85,000. Major sellers included works by Mark Rothko, Wassily Kandinsky, Marc Chagall, and Tamara de Lempicka.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 03:08 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8461669)\n\n**Art Collection Valued at $99 Million to Be Auctioned Globally: Who Owns It?**\nSotheby's will auction approximately 135 artworks from the private collection of business art collector Jean and Terry de Jonn\u00e8sberg in April and May, with an estimated total value between $67 million and $99 million. The first auction, dedicated to design, begins on April 22 in New York and is described by Sotheby's as 'the most expensive single-owner design auction in its history,' with an estimated value of $30 million to $44 million. This will be followed by evening auctions in May featuring modern and contemporary art. Key highlights from the May auctions include an untitled Mark Rothko painting from 1969, estimated at $10\u201315 million, which was created in the year before the artist's death and is linked to his work on the Rothko Chapel; an untitled Agnes Martin painting No. 6 (1977), valued at $3\u20134 million; and Robert Ryman's 'Editions 3' (1992), estimated at $2.5\u20133.5 million. Additional works include a 1955 Picasso portrait and a 1932 painting by Paul Klee. The April design auction features a set of 15 mirrors designed by Claude Lalanne between 1974 and 1985 for the music room in Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berg\u00e9\u2019s Paris apartment, valued at $10\u201315 million.

The top lot is Isaac Levitan's 1889 painting 'Rising Moon. Village,' valued at 50 million rubles, which previously belonged to Soviet inventor Vladimir Mitkevich and was exhibited twice at the Tretyakov Gallery and once at the Russian Museum. The painting's authenticity is confirmed by the artist's signature and preserved exhibition numbers on the stretcher.

Auctions offer transparency, public bidding, and the potential for record-breaking prices, driven by competitive demand and market visibility, though they involve longer timelines and risks such as failure to sell (unsuccessful bids) or underpricing. In contrast, private sales operate behind closed doors, providing privacy, speed, and predictable pricing through confidential negotiations among the seller, buyer, and specialist, making them ideal for high-net-worth individuals, celebrities, and institutions prioritizing discretion. Recent global trends show a significant rise in private sales, with Christie's reporting a 41% increase and Sotheby's a 17% increase in 2024, reaching $15 billion and $14 billion respectively, while auction sales declined. This shift reflects growing demand for privacy, economic uncertainty, and the preferences of new-generation collectors. Despite this, auctions remain vital for gauging market sentiment and enabling dramatic value discoveries. The article concludes that both methods complement each other, offering collectors flexibility and strategic options, with specialized firms like Aurux Vault supporting Korean collectors in navigating global markets. The key to success lies in aligning the chosen method with individual goals and circumstances.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 01:04 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/202601199770i)\n\n**Could this Sotheby's design auction be the most valuable of all time?**\nThe Sotheby's design auction of the Jean and Terry de Gunzburg collection, scheduled for April 22, 2026, in New York, could become the most valuable design auction in history, with an estimated high of $43 million. The collection, comprising 123 works, is considered one of the most significant and visionary assemblages of 20th-century French design ever offered at auction, featuring masterpieces by Claude and Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lalanne, Jean-Michel Frank, Jean Roy\u00e8re, and others. The collection was primarily drawn from the de Gunzburgs' New York apartment, designed by Jacques Granges with a 'New York on the outside, Paris on the inside' aesthetic. Terry de Gunzburg, a former medical student and founder of a pioneering beauty brand (described as the 'Steve Jobs' of the beauty industry), and her husband Jean, a molecular and cell biologist and descendant of the noble Gunzburg family, amassed the collection over decades across five homes. A standout highlight is a group of 15 gilt-bronze mirrors by Claude Lalanne, designed for Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berg\u00e9\u2019s Paris home, with a high estimate of $15 million and expected to exceed that due to rarity and market demand. Other notable items include a shagreen-clad cabinet by Andr\u00e9 Groult (est. $800,000), a pair of mahogany cabinets by Alexandre Noll (est. $1 million), and a pair of striped sideboards by Jean Roy\u00e8re (est. $1 million). The auction also includes works by Mark Rothko, Pablo Picasso, Agnes Martin, and Paul Klee. The de Gunzburgs described collecting as a lifelong journey guided by instinct and emotion, and stated their intent to pass the proceeds to their seven children and over a dozen grandchildren, while also supporting charitable causes. The sale arrives amid a surge in global demand for masterpiece-level design, following Sotheby\u2019s record-breaking $60 million design week sales in December 2025, anchored by the $31.4 million sale of a Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lalanne hippo-shaped bar. Jodi Pollack, Sotheby\u2019s chairman of 20th-century design, called the collection a 'rare clarity of vision, conviction, and foresight,' marking a new era in collecting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 05:05 PM\nSource:[Wallpaper*](https://www.wallpaper.com/design-interiors/sothebys-jean-terry-de-gunzburg-design-auction)\n\n**Art Sales Decline, Luxury Goods Surge: The Big Three Auction Houses Face a Structural Shift**\nThe 'Big Three' auction houses\u2014Christie's, Sotheby's, and Phillips\u2014are undergoing a strategic shift as luxury goods sales grow rapidly, challenging their traditional identity as art-focused institutions. While fine art sales declined from $10.8 billion in 2022 to $7.04 billion in 2025, luxury category sales rose 18% year-on-year to $1.84 billion in 2025, driven largely by classic cars. Sotheby's now derives about one-third of its revenue from luxury goods\u2014triple the 2019 level\u2014while Christie's luxury segment accounts for roughly one-quarter of total sales. This growth is attributed to rising demand from new wealthy markets, particularly in the Middle East. Experts describe this as a 'structural shift,' with auction houses evolving into integrated luxury platforms offering cars, jewelry, real estate, and high-end consumer goods. While former Christie's CEO Guillaume Cuxat insists this diversification strengthens rather than redefines the auction model, the long-term implications remain uncertain. In South Korea, luxury auctions are still experimental; although Seoul Auction and K Auction have introduced luxury items like Herm\u00e8s Birkin bags and Rolex watches, fine art remains the dominant revenue source. Notably, 38% of Christie's new customers in 2025 made their first purchase in the luxury category, not art. The trend of declining art sales and rising luxury sales suggests that auction houses may face significant long-term pressure to reconfigure their revenue models and brand identities.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 03:02 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20260223_0003522353)\n\n**Booming stock market is fueling a mega-billion return to classic art...**\nThe classic art market is experiencing a major resurgence, with New York auction houses Christie's, Phillips, and Sotheby's reporting $2.2 billion in sales during the fall season. Key highlights include Gustav Klimt's 'Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer' selling for $236.4 million at Sotheby's, a 1940s Frida Kahlo self-portrait 'El sue\u00f1o (la cama)' fetching $55 million, and a Rothko painting 'No. 31 Yellow Stripe' selling for $62 million. These sales were driven by increased disposable income due to a booming stock market, rising wealth among billionaires, and a return of confidence after years of market volatility. The estates of Leonard A. Lauder, Robert and Patricia Ross Weis, and Jay and Cindy Pritzker contributed high-value works by Matisse, Picasso, and Chagall. In contrast, 21st-century art has struggled to attract top prices, with only Gerhard Richter\u2019s 2016 abstract painting selling for $5.5 million. Dealers attribute the shift to the speculative collapse of the NFT market (with 95% of NFTs falling to zero value by 2023) and a preference for timeless, low-volatility masterpieces. Despite this, some contemporary works like Maurizio Cattelan\u2019s 'Comedian' (a banana duct-taped to a wall) have seen dramatic appreciation, selling for $6 million in 2024. The broader trend reflects a cultural desire for handmade, spiritually resonant art in an increasingly impersonal digital world, exemplified by the $7.6 million sale of a 15th-century unidentified triptych, 'The Five Miracles of Christ.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 14, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/12/14/world-news/booming-stock-market-is-fueling-a-mega-billion-return-to-classic-art/)\n\n**Unprecedented Record: Rare Gustav Klimt Painting Ignites Global Art Auctions**\nA rare painting by Austrian artist Gustav Klimt, titled 'Portrait of Elizabeth Lederer,' sold for $236.4 million at a record-breaking Sotheby's auction in New York, becoming the most expensive artwork ever sold in a public auction and the highest sale in Sotheby's history. The sale, which lasted 20 minutes and drew applause and astonishment from attendees, marked a significant milestone in the global art market. The painting is one of the last remaining portraits of Klimt of such importance, following the 2023 sale of his completed work 'Lady with a Fan' for $108.4 million. Other standout sales included an Edvard Munch painting sold for $35.1 million, a Klimt landscape for $86 million, and a sculpture by Alexander Calder that sold for $889,000\u2014three times its high estimate. The overall collection, led by the Loder Collection, achieved $527.5 million, surpassing its $400 million estimate. Sotheby's recorded a total of $706 million in sales across two auctions, setting a personal record. Notable sales included a Jean-Michel Basquiat work for $48.3 million and a new record for British contemporary artist Cecily Brown at $9.8 million. However, two major works by Kerry James Marshall and Barkley L. Hendricks failed to sell. A controversial golden toilet sculpture by Maurizio Cattelan titled 'America,' weighing 220 pounds and made of 18-karat gold, was offered with a starting bid of $10 million based on its gold value. Only one bid was received\u2014$12.1 million\u2014from Ripley's Believe It or Not!, which operates oddity museums and tourist attractions. The buyer's plans for the piece remain unclear, including whether the public will be allowed to use it. The auction marked the opening of Sotheby's new flagship location near Manhattan\u2019s famed Museum Mile, a strategic move amid a challenging art market. Global art sales declined for the second consecutive year in 2024, with major galleries closing or restructuring, and Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s, and Phillips reporting an 8% drop in sales compared to the previous year. The event highlighted the contrast between artistic value and material worth, a concept emphasized by David Galbraith, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art, who noted the pricing strategy aimed to spotlight this distinction.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 09:54 AM\nSource:[CNN Arabic](https://arabic.cnn.com/style/article/2025/11/27/sothebys-klimt-cattelan-sales)\n\n**16 Auction Records Set in November 2025**\nNew York's fall auction week in November 2025 marked a significant rebound in the art market, with Sotheby's, Christie's, and Phillips collectively generating over $2 billion in sales. The standout sale was Gustav Klimt's 'Portrait of Elizabeth Lederer' (ca. 1914\u201316), which sold for $236.36 million\u2014second-highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction and a new record for Klimt. This sale occurred during a single Sotheby's evening on November 18, 2025, which generated $706 million, the highest one-night total in the house's history. The week also set 16 new auction records, particularly for women artists associated with Surrealism and those who had major solo exhibitions in 2025. All prices include buyer\u2019s premiums.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 08:52 PM\nSource:[Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-16-auction-records-set-november-2025)\n\n**In major auction night, rare Klimt painting smashes records at $236.4 million | CNN**\nOn November 19, 2025, Sotheby's inaugural auction at its new New York headquarters marked a record-breaking night, with Gustav Klimt's 'Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer' selling for $236.4 million\u2014making it the most valuable work of modern art ever sold at auction and the highest-priced artwork in Sotheby's history. The painting, part of the estate of Est\u00e9e Lauder heir Leonard A. Lauder, survived World War II after being separated from other works destroyed in a fire at Immendorf Castle. The sale also featured Edvard Munch\u2019s painting, which fetched $35.1 million, and Maurizio Cattelan\u2019s iconic 18-karat gold toilet sculpture, 'America,' which was offered with a starting bid dynamically set to the current gold value of its 220-pound weight. The event drew large crowds to the Breuer Building, where the artwork was displayed in a mirrored bathroom under a 'look but don\u2019t touch' rule. Despite a broader art market slowdown\u2014evidenced by a two-year decline in global sales and a reported 8% drop in auction house revenues in May\u2014Sotheby's aims to surpass $1 billion in total sales this week. The success of the Klimt sale, alongside Christie\u2019s $690 million 20th-century auction and the upcoming potential record for Frida Kahlo\u2019s 'El sue\u00f1o (La cama),' suggests cautious optimism for a market rebound.

A Gerhard Richter still life from the 1990s, previously on loan at Vienna\u2019s Belvedere, sold for \u00a36.2 million\u2014nearly double its \u00a33\u20134 million estimate\u2014just as Richter\u2019s major retrospective opened in Paris. The work was acquired by Art Intelligence Global, founded by Amy Cappellazzo. New records were set for female artists including Paula Rego, Suzanne Valadon, and Annie Morris. Klaus Hegewisch\u2019s collection, previously reported by Handelsblatt on October 2, raised \u00a39 million in its first part, with 72% of lots selling above estimate; however, Picasso\u2019s 'Le repas frugal' (est. \u00a31.5\u20132.5 million) remained unsold. Sotheby\u2019s smaller auction of 27 lots, expected at \u00a333\u201348 million, achieved \u00a347.6 million, with 89% sold. Francis Bacon\u2019s 'Portrait of a Dwarf' (est. \u00a36\u20139 million) was bid for 17 minutes and sold for \u00a313.1 million to Emma Ward of Ward Moretti. Sotheby\u2019s emphasized contemporary art, with no early 20th-century or post-war works, planning to shift such pieces to Paris, where upcoming auctions may exceed \u20ac50 million in value. Christie\u2019s remains committed to London for modern art in October, supported by strong results for Post-Impressionist French works. Phillips underperformed with \u00a310.3 million at 82% sell-through. Bonhams is undergoing a transformation, having been acquired by Pemberton Asset Management, with leadership changes underway. Despite differing strategies, both houses are shifting focus toward Paris, where the upcoming Art Basel parallel events are gaining prominence. London\u2019s autumn season avoided disaster, demonstrating that high-quality, rare works continue to ensure strong sales.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 12:35 PM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/arts_und_style/kunstmarkt/auktionsnachbericht-bietgefechte-bei-christies-und-sothebys-in-london/100159781.html)\n\n**Amid Rocky Mid-Season Sales, Sotheby's Seeks Guarantor for Lauder's $300 Million Klimts**\nThe art market remains under pressure in the first half of 2025, with auction sales declining 8.8% compared to the same period in 2024, according to the Artnet Intelligence Report. Mid-season auctions at Christie's, Sotheby's, and Phillips saw over 150 unsold lots, including works by major postwar and contemporary artists such as Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly, Frank Stella, KAWS, Jonas Wood, Yayoi Kusama, and Louise Bourgeois. The ultra-contemporary segment (artists born in 1974 or later) contracted by 31.3%, generating $117.2 million, while postwar and contemporary sales fell 12.7% to $1.8 billion. All three houses earned Cs for sell-through rates: Christie's (76% of 294 lots), Phillips (72% of 158 lots), and Sotheby's (70% of 132 lots). A case study on artist Nina Chanel Abney shows her auction results have declined sharply since 2021, with total sales dropping from $2.63 million to $333,684 in 2024. Despite strong institutional support and upcoming museum shows, her works have struggled at auction. Sotheby's is preparing for its most significant test yet: the November 2025 auction of the Leonard Lauder collection, estimated at $400 million, led by three Klimt paintings. Sotheby's has guaranteed the trio and is seeking a third-party guarantor for approximately $300 million to offset risk. The top lot, Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer (1914), is estimated at $150 million; Blumenwiese (1908) at over $80 million; and Waldhag bei Unterach am Attersee (1916) at over $70 million. Potential guarantors include billionaires Ken Griffin, Bernard Arnault, Jeff Bezos, Loraine Powell-Jobs, and Taiwanese tech tycoon Pierre Chen, known for backing Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Salvator Mundi. Sotheby\u2019s majority owner, Patrick Drahi, is also a possible backer. The auction is seen as 'the Holy Grail' for guarantees. An art advisor noted that while the paintings are exceptional, buyers are cautious and aggressive, making profitability uncertain. The outcome will depend on whether a guarantor can be secured and whether the market responds to such a high-profile, high-value collection.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 01:57 PM\nSource:[artnet News](https://news.artnet.com/market/mid-season-sales-leonard-lauder-klimt-2696011)\n\n**Christie's, Phillips, and Sotheby's Achieve $136.3 Million in Hong Kong Auction, Down from Previous Autumn Sales**\nChristie's, Phillips, and Sotheby's combined achieved $136.3 million USD from the Hong Kong auction, significantly lower than the $208.6 million USD recorded in the previous autumn auction, according to ArtNews. Christie's '20th and 21st Century' auction generated $72.7 million USD from 38 pieces, a 46% decline compared to March's similar auction ($73.3 million USD). The first lot, 'Matino di Primavera' (Morning of Spring) by Salvatore, sold for over three times its estimated price\u2014slightly above $650,000. Only three of 38 pieces sold, including 'Self-Portrait in a Villa Borghese' by Adrian Ghenie (2023) and 'Table with Conversation' by David Hockney (1988). Pablo Picasso's 'Bust of a Woman' (1944) doubled its estimate of $13.6 million to sell for $25.3 million, setting a new record for the artist in a public Asian auction. Another Picasso, 'Reclining on Pillows' (1964), exceeded its $3.85 million estimate, selling for $4.14 million. Both works had third-party guarantees. Phillips' evening sale of modern and contemporary art brought in $20.6 million USD from 20 pieces, a 6.5% decrease from November 2024's $22 million USD for the same number of works. Sotheby's evening sale of modern and contemporary art achieved $43 million USD from 38 pieces, a 17% drop from last autumn\u2019s $52.6 million USD across 27 pieces, but a 13% increase from the spring equivalent ($38.3 million USD from 42 pieces), with two works unsold and four withdrawn.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 12:08 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/10/3/%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D9%88%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AB%D8%A8%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-136-%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%87%D9%88%D9%86%D8%AC/7142647)\n\n**Marquee Fall Auctions in Hong Kong Disappoint**\nThe marquee fall auctions in Hong Kong, jointly staged by Christie's, Sotheby's, and Phillips for the first time in September 2024, failed to meet expectations amid an ongoing downturn in the art market.

Christie's reported HK$565.6 million ($73 million) in sales after fees, down from HK$1.04 billion ($134 million) in the equivalent 2023 sale, with a 92% sell-through rate on 38 lots (35 sold, 3 bought in). The top seller was Pablo Picasso\u2019s 'Buste de femme' (1944), which fetched HK$196.8 million ($25.4 million) after fees\u2014setting a new Asia auction record for the artist. Sotheby's recorded HK$335.7 million ($43 million) in sales, down from HK$409.5 million ($52.6 million) in 2023, with a 65% sell-through rate; its top lot was Yoshitomo Nara\u2019s 'Can't Wait 'til the Night Comes' (2012), selling for HK$79.9 million ($10.3 million). Phillips achieved HK$159.96 million ($20.56 million), down from HK$171.14 million ($21.99 million) in 2023, with a 74% sell-through rate before withdrawals and 100% after; its top lot was Nara\u2019s 'Pinky' (2000), selling for HK$56.66 million ($7.3 million). Notable highlights included Sotheby's setting a new record for London-based Chinese artist Li Hei Di, and Phillips establishing a new record for French artist Jean-Michel Othoniel with 'Black Tornado' (2017), which sold for HK$1.7 million ($215,495). Sotheby's noted that nearly 20% of buyers were new to the house, with seven of the top 10 lots purchased by collectors from Greater China and increased bidding activity from Singapore.
