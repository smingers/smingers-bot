Typically ranges from **20% to 30%**, depending on the auction house and sale category.\n- **Tiered structure**: Most major auction houses use a sliding scale where the premium percentage *decreases* as the lot price increases. Example given: 25% on the first $100,000; 20% on the next $400,000; 15% on anything above that.\n- **Catalogue estimates** do *not* include the buyer's premium, but **post-sale announced prices often do**, which can make results appear stronger than the hammer price alone suggests.\n\n### Implications Noted:\n- Sellers do not receive the buyer's premium portion of the final reported price.\n- Buyers should also account for potential taxes (VAT, sales tax) beyond the premium.\n\n*This article is from a general-audience auction education source (Barnebys), not an official auction house publication.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.culturetype.com/2017/05/25/basquiats-moment-record-shattering-110-million-painting-is-most-expensive-ever-by-an-american-artist-sold-at-auction/\">\n## Summary: Basquiat's \"Untitled\" Sells for $110.5 Million at Sotheby's (May 2017)\n\n**The Sale**\n- Jean-Michel Basquiat's *\"Untitled\"* (1982) \u2014 a large-scale skull painting on turquoise background \u2014 sold at Sotheby's New York Contemporary Art Evening Auction on **May 18, 2017** for **$110,487,500 (including fees)**.\n- Bidding opened at $57 million.\n- This was a **public auction sale** at **Sotheby's**.\n\n**Records Set**\n- Most expensive work by an **American artist** ever sold at auction (at the time).\n- Basquiat became the **youngest artist** to eclipse the $100 million mark at auction (he was 21 when he painted it).\n- Artist record for Basquiat, nearly doubling his previous record of $57.3 million set at Christie's in 2016.\n\n**The Buyer**\n- Japanese billionaire and e-commerce entrepreneur **Yusaku Maezawa** purchased the work.

(Source: Christie's press release, December 2024)\n\n## 2026 CONSIGNMENTS EXPECTED ABOVE $100M\n\nBased on the search results, **no specific paintings have been announced for 2026 spring auctions with estimates above $100M** as of the information available. The major 2025 fall season consignments have already been sold (November 2025). Key context:\n\n- The **Lauder Collection** (Sotheby's) and **Weis Collection** (Christie's) were the headline fall 2025 consignments. The Lauder sale's star lot (Klimt's Elisabeth Lederer, est. $150M+) has already sold for $236.4M.\n- **Christie's** secured the Weis family collection (80 works, $180M+ collective estimate) and Elaine Wynn estate works ($75M+ collective estimate) for fall 2025 \u2014 these have now been sold.\n- **Max Berry Collection** (Christie's): A multi-year rollout including American art in January 2026 and Chinese art from March 2026 through 2027, but no individual painting lots are expected to approach $100M. (Source: Observer, October 2025)\n- No specific spring 2026 consignments with $100M+ painting estimates have been publicly announced in the available search results.\n\n## MARKET CONTEXT FOR THE FORECASTING QUESTION\n\n**Frequency of $100M+ painting sales:** Since 2013, there has been at least one $100M+ painting sale in most years, with some years producing multiple such results (2015, 2022, 2025). The question asks whether this will occur **before May 1, 2026**, which covers the spring 2026 auction season (typically March\u2013May).\n\n**Historical spring auction pattern:** Major spring sales at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York typically occur in May. The question's deadline of May 1, 2026 means it would need to happen in an early spring sale or a special evening sale before May 1.\n\n**Key risk factors:**\n- Global auction sales fell 6.2% in H1 2025 (Art Tactic study cited in The Art Newspaper)\n- Sotheby's lost $248M in 2024, more than doubling prior-year losses\n- The art market has been in a multi-year softening since the 2022 peak\n- The November 2025 sales consumed the most prominent available trophy consignments\n- No $100M+ painting consignment for spring 2026 has been publicly announced\n\n**Favorable factors:**\n- The Klimt Elisabeth Lederer sale at $236.4M in November 2025 demonstrates ultra-high-end demand remains active\n- Christie's and Sotheby's are actively competing for trophy consignments\n- The spring 2026 season could still attract unannounced consignments\n- Historical base rate: approximately 1\u20132 $100M+ painting sales per year at major houses\n\n**Assessment:** The question resolves YES if a $100M+ painting sale occurs before May 1, 2026. Given that the major fall 2025 consignments have been sold, the spring 2026 window (January\u2013April 2026) is relatively short and no qualifying consignment has been announced. However, unannounced consignments regularly emerge close to sale dates. The base rate of $100M+ sales occurring in any given year is high (roughly 1\u20133 per year since 2013), but the specific pre-May 2026 window is narrow and the market is in a softer phase. The probability is moderate but not high \u2014 perhaps 25\u201340% \u2014 given the compressed timeframe and absence of announced qualifying lots.</Agent_report>\n"
