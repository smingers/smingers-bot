  "context": "\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://press.christies.com/section/press-releases\">\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted content from Christie's press releases page is essentially non-functional for summarization purposes. The page appears to have returned only cookie consent notices, login prompts, and authentication token data rather than any actual press release content. No meaningful editorial or news content about auction results, sales, or paintings was retrievable from this extraction.\n\n**Summary of what was extracted:**\nThe page (press.christies.com/section/press-releases) returned only:\n- Cookie consent and preference management text (covering necessary cookies, performance cookies, and functional cookies)\n- A login interface with fields for region/auction center, email, and password\n- What appears to be session/authentication token strings (user ID and token hash)\n\n**No actual press release content was available** in this extraction \u2014 no auction results, no sale prices, no painting-specific announcements, and no information relevant to whether a painting sold for $100 million or more at Christie's. The forecaster would need to access the page directly or obtain a fresh extraction to review any actual press releases.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.phillips.com/press\">\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted content from the Phillips press page appears to be largely structural/navigational rather than substantive article content. It appears the actual press releases did not load or were not captured in the extraction. The content only reflects the page's filter interface and contact information for Phillips PR staff.\n\n**Summary of available content:**\n\nThe page is Phillips' official press releases section, which allows filtering by:\n- **Year:** 2026, 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022\n- **Departments:** Contemporary, Design, E-Commerce, Editions, Jewelry, Online, Photographs, Watches\n- **Locations:** Chicago, Geneva, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, Miami, Milan, New York, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Southampton, Tokyo\n\n**Key press contacts listed:**\n- **Katie Carder** \u2013 Head of Press, Europe (London)\n- **Jaime Israni** \u2013 Public Relations Director, Americas (New York)\n- **Ingrid Hsu** \u2013 Public Relations Director, Asia (Hong Kong)\n\nNo actual press release content, sale results, or auction outcomes were captured in the extraction. Therefore, **no information relevant to a $100 million+ painting sale can be drawn from this source as extracted.** A direct visit to the page or a more complete extraction would be needed to assess any relevant announcements.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.barnebys.com/blog/auctions-101-hammer-price-vs.-buyers-premium\">\n## Summary: Auctions 101 \u2013 Hammer Price vs. Buyer's Premium (Barnebys Magazine, August 15, 2025)\n\nThis article is an **educational explainer** on auction pricing mechanics, relevant to understanding how final sale prices are calculated and reported.\n\n### Key Facts & Definitions:\n\n- **Hammer price**: The final bid accepted by the auctioneer when the gavel falls; the base sale price of the item.\n- **Buyer's premium** (buyer's fee): An additional fee charged *on top of* the hammer price, paid by the buyer and calculated as a percentage of the hammer price. Typically ranges from **20% to 30%**, depending on the auction house and sale category.\n- **Tiered structure**: Most major auction houses use a sliding scale where the premium percentage *decreases* as the lot price increases. Example given: 25% on the first $100,000; 20% on the next $400,000; 15% on anything above that.\n- **Catalogue estimates** do *not* include the buyer's premium, but **post-sale announced prices often do**, which can make results appear stronger than the hammer price alone suggests.\n\n### Implications Noted:\n- Sellers do not receive the buyer's premium portion of the final reported price.\n- Buyers should also account for potential taxes (VAT, sales tax) beyond the premium.\n\n*This article is from a general-audience auction education source (Barnebys), not an official auction house publication.*\n</QuestionSource>\n"
