I'll work through this systematically.

**AskNews articles:** Multiple credible sources confirming: Genesis Invitational results (Bridgeman won, McIlroy T-2, Scheffler T-12), current world rankings, Scheffler's early-round struggles, McIlroy's strong form.

**Key factual consensus across sources:**
- McIlroy won 2025 Masters in playoff over Justin Rose (career Grand Slam)
- Scheffler won 2025 PGA Championship and 2025 British Open (two 2025 majors)
- Scheffler is World No. 1, McIlroy No. 2
- Current odds: Scheffler ~+275-300, McIlroy ~+600-750

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- *Betting market consensus (multiple independent bookmakers)*: Scheffler +275 to +300 (implied ~25%), McIlroy +600-750 (implied ~12-14%). Multiple independent markets converging on same hierarchy. Strong signal.
- *Scheffler's Augusta-specific record*: Won 2022, 2024; T-4 in 2025; 4 consecutive top-4 finishes. Strong historical predictive pattern at this specific venue.
- *Scheffler's 2025 major wins (PGA + Open)*: Demonstrates continued elite major performance. Two of four 2025 majors won. Strong causal mechanism for 2026 Masters favoritism.
- *Historical base rate: back-to-back Masters rarity*: No repeat champion since Tiger 2001-02. McIlroy defending at ~12-14% implied odds already accounts for this. Strong structural factor reducing McIlroy's probability.

**Moderate evidence:**
- *McIlroy's current form*: Leads PGA Tour in strokes gained approach, T-2 at Genesis, bogey-free 64 at Pebble Beach. Positive momentum. Moderate positive signal.
- *Scheffler's early-round struggles in 2026*: 116th in R1 scoring average. Pattern of slow starts. Moderate negative signal, but his comeback ability is demonstrated.
- *DeChambeau's final-round struggles*: 11 rounds over par in 2025, 6 in final rounds. Moderate negative signal for major contention.
- *Historical trend: favorites rarely win*: "Only two pre-tournament favorites won since Tiger in 2005." Supports higher "Other" probability.

**Weak evidence:**
- *McIlroy caddie concerns*: Speculative, from non-expert source. Minor negative signal.
- *Augusta 17th hole lengthening*: McIlroy criticized it; unclear directional impact.
- *Post-Grand Slam motivation questions*: Speculative psychological factor.
- *Anthony Kim Masters qualification*: Unlikely to reach top-50 by April; minimal impact.

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**43 days until the 2026 Masters** (April 9-12, 2026). This is a near-term prediction. Key remaining events before Augusta: Cognizant Classic (Feb 26-Mar 1), Arnold Palmer Invitational, Players Championship, and potentially one or two more events.

**If timeframe halved (~21 days):** We'd be even closer to the tournament with less new information. Probabilities would barely change from current betting markets.

**If timeframe doubled (~86 days):** We'd be post-Masters. The question would be resolved. More intervening tournament results could shift form assessments.

The 43-day window means current betting markets are highly relevant. Major injuries or dramatic form changes could shift things, but the current hierarchy is well-established.

### (d) Justification

**Key factors shifting from outside view:**

1. **Scheffler's implied probability slightly elevated**: BetMGM shows +275 (implied ~26.7%), which is higher than my outside view's ~20-22%. The market has moved shorter on Scheffler since July 2025 (was +400), reflecting his two additional 2025 major wins. This is strong evidence to nudge Scheffler higher.

2. **McIlroy's implied probability**: Markets at +600-750 (implied 12-14%), lower than my outside view's 16-19%. The back-to-back rarity and post-Grand Slam motivation questions are already priced in. I'll align closer to market (~14%).

3. **"Other golfer" base rate**: Historical evidence strongly supports ~45-50% for the field. The betting markets imply roughly: Scheffler 25% + McIlroy 13% + Rahm 9% + DeChambeau 8% + field 45% (removing bookmaker margin). This aligns well with my outside view.

4. **Rahm and DeChambeau**: Both at +1000 (implied ~9% each before margin removal, ~8% after). DeChambeau's final-round struggles are a moderate negative; Rahm's LIV-affected form is also a moderate negative. I'll keep both around 7-8%.

**Calibration note**: Betting markets are the most reliable forward-looking indicator for golf majors. I should anchor heavily to them while applying modest adjustments for:
- Scheffler's demonstrated Augusta-specific dominance (slight positive)
- Back-to-back rarity for McIlroy (slight negative vs. raw market)
- DeChambeau's final-round pattern (slight negative)
- "Other" field depth (Fleetwood, Åberg, Morikawa, Schauffele, Rose, Spieth all credible)

## Probability Calibration

Starting from betting market implied probabilities (removing ~10% bookmaker margin):
- Scheffler: +275 → ~26.7% raw → ~24% after margin removal
- McIlroy: +600 → ~14.3% raw → ~13% after margin removal  
- Rahm: +1000 → ~9.1% raw → ~8% after margin removal
- DeChambeau: +1000 → ~9.1% raw → ~8% after margin removal
- Other: remainder ~47%

Adjustments:
- Scheffler: Augusta-specific dominance (4 consecutive top-4s) is exceptional. Nudge slightly higher to 25%.
- McIlroy: Back-to-back historically very rare; post-Grand Slam questions. Keep at 13%.
- Rahm: LIV form concerns, T-14 in 2025. Keep at 8%.
- DeChambeau: Final-round pattern concerns. Slight reduction to 7%.
- Other: Increases to 47%.

Final: Scheffler 25, McIlroy 13, Rahm 8, DeChambeau 7, Other 47.

## Checklist

1. **Resolution criteria**: Winner of 2026 Masters (April 9-12) per Masters.com. Named players or "Other golfer." ✓

2. **Outside view base rates**: Scheffler 20%, McIlroy 16%, Rahm 8%, DeChambeau 8%, Other 48%. Inside view moves Scheffler up slightly (market consensus), McIlroy down slightly (back-to-back rarity), Other roughly stable. ✓

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Scheffler (25%), Other (47%); Least likely = DeChambeau (7%). Makes sense given Scheffler's dominance and field depth. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Scheffler at +275-300 across multiple bookmakers (strong, factual market consensus)
   - Scheffler won 2022, 2024 Masters; T-4 in 2025 (strong Augusta-specific record)
   - No back-to-back Masters champion since Tiger 2001-02 (strong historical pattern)
   - McIlroy leads PGA Tour in strokes gained approach, T-2 at Genesis (moderate positive form signal)
   - Historical: most winners had pre-tournament odds +1000-3000 (moderate, supports "Other")

5. **Blind spot**: Scheffler suffers an injury in the next 6 weeks, dramatically shifting the market toward McIlroy or "Other." Would reduce Scheffler to ~5% and increase Others proportionally.

6. **Status quo**: Scheffler remains World No. 1 and Masters favorite; no major changes expected in 43 days. Current hierarchy likely to persist.

7. **Technicalities**: 25 + 13 + 8 + 7 + 47 = 100. ✓

Probabilities: [25, 13, 8, 7, 47]
