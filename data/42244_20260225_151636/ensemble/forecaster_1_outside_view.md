Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**PGA TOUR Past Results Page (2026 Masters):** This is the most critical source. It lists Rory McIlroy as the 2026 Masters winner at -11, defeating Justin Rose in what appears to be a playoff situation (both at -11). This is an official PGA TOUR results page, which is a primary source of high credibility. This is a factual document describing a past event (April 9-12, 2026). However, today is February 25, 2026, and the tournament is scheduled for April 9-12, 2026 — which is in the future. This creates a paradox: the source appears to describe future results. This could be: (1) a pre-populated template with incorrect data, (2) a data error, (3) fabricated/hallucinated content from the web scraping agent, or (4) genuinely leaked/pre-loaded results. Given that the Fox Sports, NBC Sports, and ESPN sources all confirm McIlroy won the **2025** Masters at -11 in a playoff over Justin Rose, and the PGA TOUR source describes the **2026** Masters with identical details (McIlroy -11, Rose -11, same playoff structure), this is almost certainly a data artifact — either the agent confused 2025 and 2026 results, or the PGA TOUR page was incorrectly scraped. The 2025 Masters results are being misattributed to 2026.

**Fox Sports, NBC Sports, ESPN (Masters winners lists):** These are reputable sports media outlets providing historical records. All three confirm McIlroy won the **2025** Masters at -11 in a playoff over Justin Rose. These are factual historical records.

**GolfMagic (October 2025 odds):** A golf-specific media outlet. Provides early 2026 odds with Scheffler at 4/1 as favorite. Factual odds data, though odds change over time.

**Yahoo Sports/Covers (February 18, 2026):** Most current betting odds source. Confirms Scheffler as top favorite, McIlroy close behind. Notes historical trends (no repeat champion since Tiger 2001-02). Credible sports betting analysis.

**Pro Golf Now (April 14, 2025):** Published immediately after 2025 Masters. Early DraftKings odds: Scheffler +360, McIlroy +425. Reliable odds snapshot.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive compilation of Augusta records, rankings, injuries. Confirms the 2025 Masters results (McIlroy won in playoff over Rose). Notes Scheffler as World No. 1, McIlroy No. 2, Fleetwood No. 4. Morikawa won 2026 Pebble Beach. No injuries to Scheffler/McIlroy/DeChambeau. Åberg's strong Augusta trajectory. This appears to be a well-researched synthesis.

**Critical Assessment of PGA TOUR Source:** The PGA TOUR source describing "2026 Masters" results that are identical to confirmed 2025 results (McIlroy -11, Rose -11, Reed T3, Scheffler 4th, DeChambeau T5) is almost certainly a data error — the 2025 results being displayed on a 2026 URL template. I will treat this as unreliable for 2026 prediction purposes and rely on the betting markets and historical analysis instead.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

**Reference Class 1: Pre-tournament betting favorites winning majors**
Historical data suggests pre-tournament favorites win majors at roughly their implied probability, but upsets are common. The Yahoo Sports source notes "only two pre-tournament favorites have won since Tiger in 2005" and "most recent winners had pre-tournament odds between +1,000 and +3,000." This suggests the field (Other golfer) wins frequently.

**Reference Class 2: Repeat Masters champions**
No repeat Masters champion since Tiger Woods (2001-02). McIlroy won 2025; historical base rate of back-to-back is very low (~2 instances in modern era). Scheffler won 2022 and 2024 (not consecutive years).

**Reference Class 3: World No. 1 winning Masters**
World No. 1 players win majors at elevated rates. Scheffler at No. 1 with two Masters wins and a 4th in 2025 is the strongest historical analog.

**Reference Class 4: Base rate of any named player winning**
In any given Masters, the field of ~90 players competes. The top 4-5 players might collectively have ~40-50% chance based on market odds, leaving 50-60% for "Other."

**Most suitable:** Reference Class 4 combined with betting market implied probabilities provides the best framework.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The 2026 Masters is April 9-12, 2026 — approximately 43 days from now (February 25, 2026). This is a near-term prediction. Current betting markets (February 2026) are the most relevant data. Historical patterns show:
- Scheffler: 4 consecutive top-4 finishes at Augusta (T21, won, won, 4th)
- McIlroy: Won 2025; back-to-back historically rare
- Rahm: Won 2023; T14 in 2025; LIV-related form uncertainty
- DeChambeau: T5 in 2025; clear upward trajectory

**(d) Justification**

The betting markets (most reliable forward-looking indicator) place Scheffler as the clear favorite at approximately +360 (implied ~22%), McIlroy at +425 (implied ~19%), with Rahm and DeChambeau at +1400 (implied ~7% each). The "Other golfer" category aggregates all remaining players.

Key factors:
- **Scheffler** is the strongest pick: World No. 1, two-time Masters champion, 4 consecutive top-4 Augusta finishes, no injuries, won 6 PGA Tour events in 2025
- **McIlroy**: Back-to-back historically very rare; post-Grand Slam motivation questions; but World No. 2 with elite Augusta record
- **Rahm**: Past champion but LIV-affected form, T14 in 2025, limited OWGR competition
- **DeChambeau**: Strong upward trajectory but hasn't closed the deal; T5 in 2025
- **Other**: Fleetwood (No. 4), Åberg (No. 20, two top-7 Augusta finishes), Morikawa (winning form in 2026), Schauffele, Rose, Spieth all represent significant probability

The historical trend that "most recent winners had odds between +1,000 and +3,000" and "only two pre-tournament favorites have won since Tiger in 2005" strongly supports a higher "Other" probability.

Outside view calibration:

Using betting market implied probabilities as anchors:
- Scheffler: ~22% implied by +360 odds (removing bookmaker margin, ~20-22%)
- McIlroy: ~19% implied by +425 (removing margin, ~17-19%)
- Rahm: ~7% implied by +1400 (~6-7%)
- DeChambeau: ~7% implied by +1400 (~6-7%)
- Other: Remainder ~45-50%

Adjustments:
- The historical base rate of favorites winning is lower than their implied probability suggests (favorites are systematically overbet in golf)
- "Other golfer" should be slightly higher given the depth of the field
- Scheffler's Augusta-specific dominance justifies keeping him as the top pick
- McIlroy's back-to-back historical rarity and post-Grand Slam motivation questions slightly reduce his probability
- The PGA TOUR source (which appears to be a data error showing 2025 results) should NOT be used to inflate McIlroy's 2026 probability

Final calibration: Scheffler ~20%, McIlroy ~16%, Other ~48%, Rahm ~8%, DeChambeau ~8%

Outside View Prediction:
Option_A: 20
Option_B: 16
Option_C: 8
Option_D: 8
Option_E: 48
