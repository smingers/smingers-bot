I'll work through this systematically.

## Analysis

### (a) Source Analysis

**BetMGM Blog (Feb 2026):** Commercial betting operator source. Factual on odds data (+275 Scheffler, +750 McIlroy as of ~Feb 2026). Self-serving but odds themselves are factual market data. High quality for odds, low quality for predictions.

**Sporting News UK (Feb 16, 2026):** Secondary journalism. Factual on tournament dates (Apr 9-12), McIlroy's 2025 win, Scheffler's odds (3/1). Author prediction (McIlroy) is opinion, not expert analysis. Moderate quality.

**GolfMagic (Feb 18, 2026):** Field preview article. Factual on field size (86 players), defending champion (McIlroy), Tiger Woods injury status. Moderate quality.

**Bleacher Nation (Feb 17, 2026):** Betting/odds aggregator. Factual on DraftKings odds (Scheffler +300, McIlroy +600, Rahm/DeChambeau +1000). Cites historical trends (9/11 winners had 3+ prior Masters appearances). Moderate quality.

**CBS Sports (Feb 23, 2026):** Reputable sports outlet. Factual on Scheffler's first-round struggles (116th in R1 scoring), his 18-consecutive top-10 streak ending, and his Masters odds (+300 FanDuel). High quality for factual reporting.

**Irish Independent (Feb 23, 2026):** Reputable outlet. Factual on McIlroy's T2 at Genesis Invitational, his quote "my game is in really good shape," 44 days to Masters. High quality.

**Yardbarker (Feb 25, 2026):** Sports media. Reports McIlroy's caddie concerns (Harry Diamond vs. Ted Scott comparison). This is opinion-adjacent reporting based on McIlroy's own quotes. Moderate quality.

**Yardbarker (Feb 24, 2026):** Reports McIlroy's Riviera form and strokes-gained approach leadership. Factual on stats, opinion on Masters implications. Moderate quality.

**Golfweek/USA Today (Jul 2025):** Reputable outlet. Factual on Scheffler winning 2025 British Open and PGA Championship (two 2025 majors). High quality historical record.

**EssentiallySports (Feb 15, 2026):** Reports Anthony Kim's LIV Adelaide win and OWGR jump. Factual on Kim's ranking jump (647 spots). Moderate quality.

**AP (Jan 19, 2026):** High quality. Factual list of Masters qualifiers and pathways. Authoritative.

**Yardbarker (Feb 23, 2026) - McIlroy/DeChambeau:** Reports behavioral dynamics. Anecdotal/speculative. Low-moderate quality.

**Times of India (Feb 24, 2026):** Reports Joel Dahmen's opinion on McIlroy retirement. Dahmen is a PGA Tour pro (identifiable expert) but this is speculative opinion. Weak evidence for forecasting purposes.

**Sina Sports (Feb 25, 2026):** World rankings update. Factual: McIlroy closing gap on Scheffler (still 8+ points behind), Scheffler T12 at Genesis. High quality for factual ranking data.

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **Scheffler is world No. 1 and Masters favorite at +275-+300** across multiple independent bookmakers (BetMGM, DraftKings, FanDuel). Multiple independent sources confirm. His two prior Masters wins (2022, 2024) and four consecutive Augusta top-10s are strong predictive factors. Historical pattern: repeat Masters winners are common (7/16 in 2010-2025).
- **McIlroy won 2025 Masters** (factual, confirmed by multiple sources). Defending champions have a modest but real edge at Augusta. He leads PGA Tour in strokes gained approach as of Feb 2026.
- **"Other golfer" wins most often** - historically ~50-75% of the time in any given year, the winner is not the pre-tournament favorite. This is the strongest structural evidence.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Scheffler's first-round struggles** (116th in R1 scoring) could be a vulnerability, but his overall dominance and ability to recover (16-under in final 62 holes at Genesis) partially offset this.
- **McIlroy's caddie concerns** - his own quotes suggest he overthought putts at Genesis. This is a real performance factor but uncertain in magnitude.
- **Rahm and DeChambeau at +1000** - both are credible Augusta contenders (Rahm won 2023, DeChambeau has strong Augusta history). LIV Golf participation limits their preparation data but doesn't disqualify them.
- **Historical trend**: 9 of last 11 Masters winners had 3+ prior Masters appearances and were in world top 25. This favors Scheffler, McIlroy, Rahm over DeChambeau (though DeChambeau has multiple Augusta appearances).

**Weak evidence:**
- McIlroy retirement speculation (Dahmen's opinion) - irrelevant to 2026 Masters.
- Tiger Woods possible return - 50 years old, multiple surgeries; not a realistic contender.
- Anthony Kim's LIV win - interesting story but top-50 qualification uncertain; not a named option.

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**43 days** until the first round (April 9). This is a meaningful window where:
- Injuries could emerge (would shift probabilities significantly)
- Form could clarify through Arnold Palmer Invitational and Players Championship
- No major structural changes expected to the field or course

If this window were **halved** (~3 weeks out): Probabilities would be more stable, with recent form carrying more weight. If **doubled** (~3 months): More uncertainty, wider distribution.

The current 43-day window is long enough that current form matters but short enough that the betting markets are reasonably well-calibrated.

### (d) Justification

**Scheffler adjustments from outside view (20%):**
- Two Masters wins (2022, 2024) + world No. 1 + four consecutive Augusta top-10s = strong course fit. *Nudge up slightly.*
- First-round struggles this season are a real pattern but he's shown elite recovery ability. *Minor negative.*
- Multiple bookmakers converge on +275-+300, implying ~25% true probability after vig removal. *Nudge toward market.*
- Net adjustment: **+3-4%** → ~23%

**McIlroy adjustments from outside view (14%):**
- Defending champion, completed career Grand Slam, leads strokes-gained approach. Strong form signals. *Nudge up.*
- Caddie concerns (his own words) and tendency to overthink putts are real but manageable risks. *Minor negative.*
- Market at +600 implies ~14-15% true probability. Consistent with outside view.
- Net adjustment: **+1%** → ~15%

**Rahm adjustments from outside view (9%):**
- Won 2023 Masters, strong Augusta record. LIV Golf limits competitive data but he's shown form (near-win at Adelaide). *Neutral.*
- Market at +1000 implies ~9% true probability. Consistent with outside view.
- Net adjustment: **0%** → ~9%

**DeChambeau adjustments from outside view (6%):**
- Final-round struggles noted (11 rounds over par in 2025, including 6 in final rounds). This is a meaningful negative for Augusta's demanding Sunday conditions.
- Market at +1000 implies ~9%, but his performance trend suggests he may be slightly overpriced.
- Net adjustment: **-1%** → ~5%

**Other golfer:**
- Fleetwood, Schauffele, Morikawa, Åberg, Spieth, Matsuyama, Rose, Bridgeman (now qualified), Koepka, etc. collectively represent a large probability mass.
- Historical base rate of ~50-75% for "field" winning. The named players account for ~52% combined, leaving ~48% for others.
- Net: **~48%**

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view:
- Scheffler: 20% → 23% (market signal + Augusta track record)
- McIlroy: 14% → 15% (defending champ, strong form)
- Rahm: 9% → 9% (stable)
- DeChambeau: 6% → 5% (final-round concerns)
- Other: 51% → 48% (redistribution)

Sum: 23 + 15 + 9 + 5 + 48 = 100 ✓

## Checklist

1. **Resolution criteria**: Winner of 2026 Masters (Apr 9-12) per Masters.com. Named players or "Other golfer." ✓

2. **Outside view base rates**: Scheffler 20%, McIlroy 14%, Rahm 9%, DeChambeau 6%, Other 51%. Final prediction is rooted to these with modest adjustments. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = Other golfer (48%); Least likely = DeChambeau (5%); this makes sense given historical base rates and current form signals. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - Scheffler: World No. 1, two Masters wins, four consecutive Augusta top-10s (+)
   - McIlroy: Defending champion, leads strokes-gained approach, strong recent form (+)
   - Historical: ~50%+ of Masters won by "other" player not in top 2 favorites (-)
   - DeChambeau: Final-round struggles pattern in 2025 (-)
   - Market consensus: Multiple books converge on Scheffler +275-300, McIlroy +600-750 (moderate anchor)

5. **Blind spot**: A major injury to Scheffler between now and April would dramatically shift probabilities toward McIlroy and "Other." This seems unlikely (~5% chance) but would be the most consequential scenario.

6. **Status quo**: Current trends (Scheffler dominant but with first-round issues, McIlroy in strong form) continue. No major disruptions expected. Slight nudge toward status quo already incorporated.

7. **Technicalities**: 23 + 15 + 9 + 5 + 48 = 100 ✓

Probabilities: [23, 15, 9, 5, 48]
