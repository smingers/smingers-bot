Analysis:

1) Resolution/Options (paraphrase, <30 words)  
Forecast the official winner of the 2026 Masters (Apr 9–12, 2026) per Masters.com; pick named golfer or “Other golfer” if winner not listed.

2) Outside-view base rate distribution (as provided)  
Outside view probabilities: Scheffler 7, McIlroy 72, Rahm 4, DeChambeau 4, Other 13.

(a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, date)

High-signal / relatively reliable
- BetMGM Masters 2026 odds page (Feb 2026): Scheffler +275 (~26.7% implied), McIlroy +750 (~11.8%); also reports bet share/money share. Sportsbook odds are a useful aggregate of informed belief, though include vig and can move with sentiment. (Strong for “expectations,” not “truth.”)
- Bleacher Nation summarizing DraftKings odds (Feb 17, 2026): Scheffler +300, McIlroy +600, Rahm/DeChambeau +1000. Secondary reporting, but the underlying numbers are checkable and consistent with other market sources. (Moderate-strong.)
- Golfweek/USA Today (Jul 24, 2025): earlier BetMGM odds had Scheffler +400, McIlroy +550, etc. Good for longer-run market anchoring; stale relative to today. (Moderate, dated.)
- AP “See how players have qualified” (Jan 19, 2026): factual field/qualification pathways; does not predict winner, but confirms eligibility breadth/strength. High-quality wire service. (Moderate—affects “Other golfer” depth.)

Player form / performance reporting (mixed but useful)
- Irish Independent recap of Genesis (Feb 23, 2026): McIlroy runner-up, says game in good shape; straightforward tournament reporting. (Moderate.)
- CBS Sports on Scheffler round-1 struggles (Feb 23, 2026): cites measurable stats (round-1 scoring rank) plus recent results; decent golf desk. (Moderate.)
- OWGR movement report (Feb 25, 2026, Sina): indicates McIlroy narrowed gap, Scheffler still #1; factual but secondary-language source. (Moderate, but directionally consistent.)

Opinion-heavy / lower signal
- Sporting News (Feb 16, 2026): odds plus author pick of McIlroy; the pick is opinion, odds are the useful part. (Weak-moderate.)
- Yardbarker pieces (Feb 23–25, 2026): caddie speculation, rivalry narratives, and some stat claims (e.g., strokes gained approach). Yardbarker is aggregation/opinion; useful only when it cites verifiable stats/quotes. (Weak to moderate.)
- Mirror (Feb 24, 2026): tabloid-style, but may contain real scheduling detail (McIlroy visiting Augusta). Contains a lot of framing. (Weak.)
- Easyofficepools field/odds table (Feb 17, 2026): content failed to render; no actionable data. (Discard.)

Key correction vs outside-view: “PGA TOUR past results page shows 2026 Masters already happened.”  
Given today is Feb 25, 2026 and Masters is Apr 9–12, 2026, any “completed 2026 results” page is temporally inconsistent and is not corroborated by Masters.com (the resolution authority). I treat it as non-evidence (likely mis-scrape, template, placeholder, or incorrect year routing). This is the main reason to unwind the extreme 72% McIlroy outside-view.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (large shifts)
1) Convergent sportsbook markets (BetMGM/DraftKings/FanDuel-style consensus as reported): Scheffler clear favorite (~25–27% implied), McIlroy second (~12–14%), Rahm/DeChambeau next (~8–10%). This strongly supports “no one golfer is >50%,” and “Other golfer” remains large.  
2) Structural base rate: Masters has a deep field; even favorites rarely exceed ~25–30% true win probability in a major.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
1) Current form signals: McIlroy T2 at Genesis; Scheffler still elite but some slow starts; both plausibly high win equity at Augusta.  
2) Course fit/history: Scheffler two green jackets and consistent Augusta top-10s; McIlroy defending champ. This nudges both up relative to generic top players.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
1) McIlroy caddie/putting-process chatter and “pressure off after Slam” narratives—plausible but noisy.  
2) DeChambeau “final-round over par” trend (if true) matters, but LIV/PGA comparability and small samples limit confidence.  
3) LIV vs PGA competitive reps for Rahm/DeChambeau: could matter, but majors have shown LIV players can contend; direction uncertain.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time to event: ~43 days until April 9, 2026; ~66 days until May 1 resolution deadline.  
- If timeframe were halved (~3 weeks out): I’d lean slightly more to market leaders if no injury news (odds tend to sharpen), but not by much—maybe +1–2 pts to Scheffler/McIlroy combined.  
- If timeframe were doubled (~12 weeks out, i.e., much earlier): I’d spread more to “Other golfer” due to higher injury/form uncertainty (+2–4 pts to Other).

(d) Justification: moving from outside-view to inside-view  
The outside-view was dominated by a single anomalous “already-completed 2026 results” claim that conflicts with the calendar and the resolution authority (Masters.com). Removing that artifact makes the reference class (major championship uncertainty + deep field) fully applicable again. The inside view is therefore anchored on (i) consensus betting expectations (best available quantitative aggregator pre-event) and (ii) modest form/course-fit adjustments.

Probability calibration

Status quo if trends continue:
- Scheffler remains the best tee-to-green baseline and the market favorite; no injury flags → stays highest single probability.
- McIlroy is in strong early-2026 form and has Augusta confidence as defending champ, but repeat winners are rare and his price is materially longer than Scheffler’s → clear second tier.
- Rahm and DeChambeau are credible contenders but not co-favorites in the market; keep them single-digit-to-low-teens.
- “Other golfer” should remain the plurality because the Masters winner is often “one of the rest” in any given year and the field includes multiple 10–25/1 level players (Åberg, Morikawa, Schauffele, Fleetwood, etc.) who are all in “Other.”

Consistency check (single line)  
Most likely category = Other golfer; least likely = Bryson DeChambeau (slightly below Rahm); yes—deep field + market tiers support this.

Top evidence (3–5, <20 words each)
1) Sportsbook consensus: Scheffler ~+275/+300; no player priced anywhere near 50%+.  
2) Scheffler’s Augusta record: multiple wins/top-10s; still world #1.  
3) McIlroy runner-up at Genesis; strong approach play indicators reported.  
4) Rahm/DeChambeau priced ~+1000—credible but clearly second tier.  
5) Outside-view “2026 completed results” is temporally inconsistent; treated as non-evidence.

Blind spot (scenario that makes this look silly)  
A late injury/withdrawal (Scheffler or McIlroy) or a sudden pre-Masters surge by a top “Other” (e.g., Åberg/Morikawa/Schauffele) that the market underweights; that would shift probability materially toward “Other golfer.”
