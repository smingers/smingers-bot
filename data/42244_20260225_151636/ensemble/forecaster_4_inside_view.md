Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)  
1. BetMGM / DraftKings odds pieces (Feb 16–18 2026, Sporting News, BetMGM blog, Bleacher Nation).  Factual: current market prices (+275 to +350 Scheffler, +600-750 McIlroy, 10-1 Rahm/DeChambeau).  Betting data come straight from licensed books → high-quality market signal.  Opinion: author tips – moderate value.  
2. Recent-form news – Genesis Invitational wrap-ups (Irish Independent, Straits Times, CBS Sports, Feb 23-25 2026).  Factual scores/finishes, OWGR points; reliable (live-scoring backed).  Opinion ( “Scheffler struggles on Thursdays” ) – moderate.  
3. Yardbarker caddie story & McIlroy Augusta practice round (Feb 24-25 2026).  Mostly quotes from McIlroy → weak-to-moderate evidence; Yardbarker is a content aggregator.  
4. LIV Golf Adelaide report (EssentiallySports, Feb 15 2026): factual Kim win over Rahm/DeChambeau; modest reliability, but scores verifiable.  
5. Historical winners lists (ESPN/NBC/Fox) – purely factual.  
Overall, strongest evidence = betting markets & verified tournament results; moderate = journalism on recent play; weak = speculative commentary.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong  
• Consensus odds from multiple books put Scheffler ≈25-30 % implied, McIlroy 10-15 %, Rahm/DeChambeau ≈7-10 % each.  
• Repeated top-10s at Augusta for Scheffler; historic repeat performance predictive.  
Moderate  
• McIlroy’s defence form (T-2 Riviera, leading SG:Approach).  
• Scheffler’s first-round dip but overall best scoring average.  
• Rahm & DeChambeau competitive on LIV but weaker pressure indicators.  
Weak  
• McIlroy caddie speculation.  
• Talk of McIlroy early retirement or Tiger return – little causal weight for April result.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Event ~44 days away.  In half that window (3 weeks) only two elite stroke-play events occur; barring injury, relative probabilities unlikely to move > ±3 pts.  If doubled (3 months) injury/extended form swings could shift any single player ±5-8 pts.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Base-rate (Feb 25 outside view): 16 / 14 / 5 / 5 / 60.  
Adjustments:  
+ Scheffler: two prior wins, unrivalled tee-to-green metrics, markets now quote him a shorter price than in October → +2 pts (to 18).  
+ McIlroy: strong form but back-to-back Masters historically rare (only Nicklaus ’65-’66, Faldo ’89-’90, Woods ’01-’02).  Slight defensive drag –1 pt (to 13).  
+ Rahm: still elite, good Augusta record (2023 champ), LIV rhythm adequate → +1 pt (to 6).  
+ DeChambeau: negative trend final rounds, only one win since 2024, so –1 pt (to 4).  
Field depth (Other) absorbs residual (57).  
Distribution now 18/13/6/4/57 – still aligns with market-adjusted total favourite share (~40-45 %).

Probability calibration
I sanity-checked against bookmaker “fair odds” (over-round removed ~1.35).  Favourite share 18 + 13 + 6 + 4 = 41.  This leaves the field 59; I retain 57 after rounding, consistent with majors where “other” wins roughly 60 % of the time.

Checklist
1. Options: winner of 2026 Masters; must match Masters.com champion by May 1 2026; choices are Scheffler, McIlroy, Rahm, DeChambeau, Other.  
2. Base-rate recapped above.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Other; least = DeChambeau.  Matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence  
   • Book odds from multiple books (Scheffler 3-1, McIlroy 6-1).  
   • Scheffler two green jackets + 4 straight Augusta top-10s.  
   • McIlroy defending champion, recent T-2 Riviera.  
   • Historical rarity of consecutive Masters wins.  
   • DeChambeau poor recent closing rounds.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Scheffler injury or illness week of Masters would push “Other” up and shred forecast – presently unmodelled.  
6. Status-quo tilt: depth of field usually prevails → ensures “Other” kept majority share.  
7. Technicalities: probabilities 0-100, sum = 100.

Probabilities: [18, 13, 6, 4, 57]
