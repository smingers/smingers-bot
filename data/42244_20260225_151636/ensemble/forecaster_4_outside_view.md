Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. “PGA TOUR past-results page – 2026 Masters” (dated in the future!): claims Rory McIlroy already won the 2026 Masters. Because today is 25 Feb 2026 and the tournament will be played 9–12 Apr 2026, this “result” is chronologically impossible. I treat the page as either a placeholder or an erroneous scrape and give it zero evidentiary weight.  
2. Fox Sports, NBC Sports, ESPN lists of past champions (all Apr 2025 or earlier): purely factual historic records; high quality; no forward-looking opinions.  
3. GolfMagic (Oct 2025) & Pro Golf Now (Apr 2025) early-odds pieces: secondary journalism drawing from bookmakers (DraftKings / UK books). Useful for seeing how betting markets priced players six to ten months ago, but somewhat stale and partly opinion-laden.  
4. Yahoo Sports/Covers (18 Feb 2026) odds update: most recent view of betting markets; good real-time proxy for crowd probabilities; factual when quoting odds, opinion when interpreting them.  
5. Agent research report (Feb 2026): compiles recent finishes, OWGR, injuries. Largely factual but not independently verified; moderate quality and used cautiously.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
1. All Masters winners since 1934 (n≈90) – very broad, spans different equipment eras.  
2. Masters winners in the OWGR era (1990-2025, n=36) – captures modern field depth.  
3. Masters winners since 2010 (n=16) – most relevant to the current competitive landscape and course-set-up philosophy.  

I choose class 3 (2010-2025). It is recent enough to reflect current athletic standards yet large enough (16 champs) to give stable base rates.

Empirical frequencies from 2010-2025:  
• Pre-tournament betting favourite won 2/16 times (~13%).  
• World top-5 players won 10/16 (~62%).  
• Repeat winners (already owned a green jacket) occurred 7/16 (~44%).  
• The specific individuals now listed in the answer options account for 4/16 past titles (Scheffler 2, Rahm 1, McIlroy 1).  
• Field (“Other golfer”) won 12/16 times (~75%); but because Scheffler took two of those titles, the field share is lower in talent-weighted probability than raw win count suggests.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are 43 days from first round and 65 days from the latest possible playoff finish. Betting markets six weeks out usually over-estimate the favourite compared with final market closes, but the conversion from odds to true win probability rarely changes by more than a few percentage points in this window unless major injuries occur. Historically, course-specific “horses for courses” like Augusta show comparatively stable win chances once inside a two-month window.

(d) Justification for outside-view numbers  
Step 1 – start from purely combinatorial base: a typical Masters field is ~90 players (incl. amateurs and aging former champs who rarely contend). Roughly 60 possess a plausible chance; a neutral‐ignorance prior would assign each ~1.7%.  

Step 2 – adjust by the modern empirical finding that the eventual winner almost always comes from the world top-25 and almost always has at least one prior Augusta top-10. That immediately lifts Scheffler, McIlroy, Rahm and (to a lesser extent) DeChambeau well above field average while leaving ∼35-40 other realistic contenders.  

Step 3 – weight by recent historical win shares: 2010-25 data imply the combined chance for “named super-elite” (the top two or three betting favourites) sits near 30-35%, the next tier near 25-30%, the remaining field ~35-40%.  

Step 4 – convert betting-odds signal (Fanatics/DraftKings as of 18 Feb 2026) into implied probabilities (after standard over-round removal). That yields approximate market shares: Scheffler 22%, McIlroy 16%, Rahm 10%, DeChambeau 6%, all others 46%.  

Step 5 – nudge toward long-run base rates. Markets habitually price the very favourite a little too short – favourites have won 13% vs market-implied ~20-25%. Therefore trim Scheffler a couple of points and redistribute evenly across the rest, especially to “Other”.  

Outside view calibration:

• Favourite-win base rate (2010-25): 13%. Set Scheffler modestly higher than that because he owns two jackets and has never finished outside T21 at Augusta: assign 20%.  
• Next-best single player base (historic second favourite wins ~10%): give McIlroy 14% – slightly above the mean second-favourite because he is defending champ.  
• Third favourite historical base ~8%: give Rahm 9%.  
• DeChambeau’s Augusta trend is positive but he is still less likely than Rahm; allocate 6%.  
• Remainder of plausible contenders (≈50 players) collectively retain the majority probability: 51%.  

Sum check: 20 + 14 + 9 + 6 + 51 = 100%.

Outside View Prediction:
Scottie Scheffler: 20%  
Rory McIlroy: 14%  
Jon Rahm: 9%  
Bryson DeChambeau: 6%  
Other golfer: 51%
