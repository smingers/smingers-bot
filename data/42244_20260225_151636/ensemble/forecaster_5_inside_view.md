Analysis
1. Paraphrase of resolution criteria (≤30 words)
Champion of the 2026 Masters as listed on Masters.com by 1 May 2026. Options: Scheffler, McIlroy, Rahm, DeChambeau, any other golfer.

2. Outside-view base-rate (built from de-vigged February betting markets, adjusted −2 pts favourite bias)
Scheffler 17 | McIlroy 12 | Rahm 9 | DeChambeau 6 | Other 56.

3. Source & evidence analysis (abbreviated)
– BetMGM / DraftKings / FanDuel odds (Feb 16-24 ’26).  Reliable market data; factual (Strong).  
– Genesis Invitational wrap-ups (CBS, Irish Independent, Straits Times).  Tournament results, finishing positions; factual (Strong).  
– OWGR update (Sina, Feb 25).  Factual rankings (Strong).  
– Yardbarker caddie-issue story (Feb 25).  McIlroy quote, but speculative about impact (Weak-Moderate).  
– LIV Adelaide reports (EssentiallySports).  Factual Kim win; Rahm/DeChambeau beaten (Moderate).  

Evidence weighting  
Strong:  current odds, recent PGA-Tour finishes, OWGR.  
Moderate:  McIlroy caddie chatter, DeChambeau final-round pattern, LIV form.  
Weak:  early-season opinion pieces, injury-free declarations that could change.

4. Timeframe analysis  
44 days until first round.  Roughly half a typical “form cycle”.  If cut to 22 days: probabilities converge toward market; Scheffler +1-2 pts, injury risk smaller.  If doubled to 88 days: more variance, Other +3 pts.

5. Inside-view adjustments & justification  
a) Scheffler up from 17→22 (Strong current favourite, elite Augusta record, no injuries; slow-start issue viewed as noise).  
b) McIlroy 12→14 (Defending champ, hot iron play, but small drag for potential caddie switch).  
c) Rahm 9→8 (Solid talent, but fewer reps on PGA-Tour setups, mixed LIV form).  
d) DeChambeau 6→5 (Documented Sunday struggles and only one win since 2024).  
e) Other down 56→51 (probability given up to front-runners, still majority because field strength beyond four named is huge—Åberg, Schauffele, Morikawa, Fleetwood, etc.).

6. Key evidence items (≤20 words each)
• Markets price Scheffler at ~25 % implied; widest gap to field since 2015.  
• Scheffler two prior green jackets, 4 straight Augusta top-10s.  
• McIlroy runner-up at Genesis, leads SG:Approach 2026.  
• Rahm & DeChambeau beaten by Anthony Kim; limited stroke-play wins since 2024.  
• Historic: 23/26 Masters winners inside OWGR top-25 already six weeks out.

7. Consistency check  
Most likely = Scheffler; Least likely = DeChambeau among named; aligns with evidence and odds.

8. Blind-spot statement  
Major injury or illness removing Scheffler/McIlroy before April would swing >10 pts into “Other”.

9. Status-quo outcome  
If nothing changes, betting boards stay similar; present split reflects that baseline.
