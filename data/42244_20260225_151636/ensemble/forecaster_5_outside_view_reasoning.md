**Analyzing Master's Odds**

I’m focusing on an outside view analysis for the Masters, rather than relying on recent news. I’ll base this on historical win rates, considering the probabilities for the top five contenders: Scheffler, McIlroy, Rahm, DeChambeau, and others. It’s interesting that today’s date is February 25, 2026, with the tournament happening April 9-12. I plan to summarize various sources, evaluate their quality, and analyze the distribution of wins among the top-ranked players from 2000 to 2025. Let's design this analysis!**Calculating Historical Win Probabilities**

Looking at historical winners from 2000-2025, winners like Woods, Mickelson, and Scheffler indicate that most champions have been within the top 25 world rankings. I’m thinking of using these rankings to create a baseline probability for each of the top players this year—Scheffler, McIlroy, Rahm, and DeChambeau. Historically, I can assign probabilities like 14% for Scheffler and 10% for McIlroy, while considering adjustments based on their performance. I’ll refine these estimates based on bookmaker odds and get back to adjusting the probabilities accordingly!**Evaluating Odds and Probabilities**

I’m considering the early odds for the Masters and how outside views might shape perceptions differently from sportsbooks. I have some implied probabilities from February 18, like Scheffler at +350 and McIlroy at +650. I’d convert these odds, factoring in vig, to create a probability distribution. I can draft something like 21% for Scheffler and 13% for McIlroy. Notably, looking back from 2000-2025, “Other” winners have reasonable chances, so proposing around 50% for that category makes sense! Let’s refine this further and craft a clear explanation.
