Analysis:
The key to an outside-view forecast is understanding (a) how often any one of the named players actually wins the Masters, (b) how each has performed at Augusta National and in recent majors, and (c) which “other” golfers could realistically beat them.  Therefore we want (1) a clean list of historical Masters champions to establish base-rates, (2) very recent news on form, injuries, equipment or coaching changes that could alter 2026 expectations, and (3) a deeper statistical profile of the four named golfers vs. the broader field (OWGR, strokes-gained, Augusta finishes, etc.).
