McIlroy admitted that overthinking his putts\u2014particularly after observing others\u2019 shots\u2014cost him a chance to win the 2026 Genesis Invitational, stating he should have trusted his first instinct. He noted that Diamond did not step in to correct this pattern, unlike top caddies such as Ted Scott, who played a pivotal role in Scheffler\u2019s 2024 Paris Olympics gold medal win. According to Scheffler, Scott took over green reading during the back nine on Sunday, enabling a 9-under 62 and six birdies in a row, which secured victory. McIlroy\u2019s past success, including four majors, was achieved with veteran caddie JP Fitzgerald, raising speculation that a caddie change may be necessary for him to reach Scheffler\u2019s elite level.

Collin Morikawa, after winning the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, finished tied for seventh, earning 9.20513 points, and retained fifth place. Xander Schauffele also tied for seventh, earning the same points, and rose from 13th to 9th in the world rankings. Scottie Scheffler's streak of 18 consecutive top-10 finishes ended this week as he tied for 12th, earning 6.10188 points.

Top players like Scottie Scheffler are absent, resulting in a weaker field, but several compelling storylines remain. The most prominent is Shane Lowry's pursuit of his first solo PGA Tour victory since 2015. Lowry, who last won the 2019 Open Championship and the 2024 Zurich Classic with Rory McIlroy, has shown strong form at PGA National, finishing runner-up and in the top 11 in his last four appearances. At +1600 odds (FanDuel), he is a co-favorite to win, making this event his best opportunity to end a prolonged winless streak.

This substantial prize fund has intensified competition among top players. As of February 24, 2026, Jacob Bridgeman leads the money list with $5.2 million, followed by Collin Morikawa ($4.2 million), Chris Gotterup ($3.6 million), and Scottie Scheffler ($3.4 million). Bridgeman expressed satisfaction with his performance, stating, 'Each tournament is a new opportunity and I'm just trying to stay focused and keep improving.' Gotterup, a standout rookie, emphasized the high level of competition, saying, 'It's a great honor to be on this list and compete with these incredible players.' Other top performers include Min Woo Lee ($2.3 million), Jake Knapp ($2.2 million), Rory McIlroy ($2.1 million), Hideki Matsuyama ($2.1 million), Ryan Gerard ($2.0 million), Kurt Kitayama ($2.0 million), Sepp Straka ($1.9 million), and several emerging talents. The season's diversity is highlighted by rising stars challenging established veterans.

Dahmen noted that McIlroy, having already achieved the career Grand Slam at the 2025 Masters, now has no further career milestones to pursue. With current top golfers like McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler earning tens of millions annually in prize money, bonuses, and endorsements, financial security is achieved much earlier than in past generations. Dahmen believes that this financial independence, combined with the physical toll of modern high-speed swings (185\u2013190 mph vs. older 165 mph), will lead to shorter careers. He predicts that elite players will likely peak and retire in their mid-30s, having accumulated $250 million, settled their families, and fulfilled their ambitions. Dahmen added that this shift is already underway and will become more evident within the next decade. He also referenced the impact of NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) deals in college sports, suggesting that early financial success is altering athlete motivation across sports. According to Dahmen, the traditional drive to play into the Champions Tour era may no longer exist.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 06:44 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/pga-tour-pro-breaks-silence-on-rory-mcilroys-potential-retirement-timeline-and-shares-an-honest-verdict/articleshow/128759933.cms)\n\n**Jacob Bridgeman's breakout win, Tiger Woods' eventful week and the most painful fantasy football punishment ever**\nJacob Bridgeman secured his first PGA Tour victory at the Genesis Invitational, overcoming a seven-shot lead reduction to win by one stroke at Riviera, earning a silver trophy from Tiger Woods. His consistent performance, including four consecutive top-20 finishes to start 2026 and a Tour Championship appearance last year, confirmed his legitimacy. Jeeno Thitikul claimed her most significant career win at the LPGA Honda Thailand in her home country, with emotional support from her mother. Anthony Kim made a remarkable comeback after overcoming injuries, substance abuse, and mental health struggles, winning for the first time in 16 years by defeating Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm, with a touching moment as his daughter greeted him on the 18th green. Scottie Scheffler's 11-month streak of top-10 finishes ended at T-12 after strong performances from Cam Young and Tommy Fleetwood, though his Thursday struggles (73, 72, 74 in last three opening rounds) raised questions about his start consistency. A viral fantasy football punishment video showed a player suffering a painful golf ball impact to the midsection, highlighting the high-stakes nature of fantasy sports. The PGA Tour continues with the Cognizant Classic at PGA National, where bucket hat wearers have won the past two years. Random bets include Joel Dahmen winning (80-to-1) and wearing a bucket hat (locked). Tiger Woods had an eventful week, posing with girlfriend Vanessa Trump at the Ben Hogan statue and giving a pep talk to the Lakers, who lost to the Celtics. Rory McIlroy\u2019s quote about a $600,000 bonus was noted as a highlight. Justin Thomas returned from back surgery in a TGL win and will play at Bay Hill next week.

According to Gary Williams of 5 Clubs, McIlroy\u2019s 64 in the final round at Pebble Beach\u2014bogey-free\u2014highlighted his improved shot-making, particularly his ability to flight shots with precision, execute low bullet-like trajectories, and control ball roll on soft fairways. These skills were notably evident on the 18th hole, where he consistently placed shots on the spine of the fairway, allowing them to bleed out to the right. Williams also pointed to McIlroy\u2019s pivotal tee shot at the 17th during the playoff at The Players Championship as a turning point in his season. McIlroy currently leads the PGA Tour in strokes gained approach, surpassing Scottie Scheffler, and came close to overtaking Bridgeman in the final round at Pacific Palisades, missing only by a fraction. With Scheffler not yet at peak form and McIlroy freed from the pressure of needing to win, his path to a sixth major title in 2026 appears increasingly viable.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 04:53 PM\nSource:[Yardbarker](https://www.yardbarker.com/golf/articles/the_moment_at_riviera_that_could_help_rory_mcilroy_at_augusta/s1_17664_43511884)\n\n**Rory McIlroy shows true colours in \u00a31.3m payday snub after 'extra money' comment - The Mirror**\nRory McIlroy has opted to skip the Cognizant Classic, choosing instead to play a round at Augusta National with his father, Gerry, and National Chairman Fred Ridley. This decision comes after McIlroy finished tied for second at the Genesis Invitational, earning \u00a31.3 million\u2014just one stroke behind champion Jacob Bridgeman. Although he acknowledged that finishing joint-second earned him an additional \u00a3445,000 compared to a tied-third finish, McIlroy downplayed the financial impact, stating, 'It probably earned me an extra 400, 500 grand, so it's fine.' He reflected on his performance, admitting he overthought his putts, particularly on the front nine, and failed to trust his instincts, saying, 'I was reading too much into them... I was almost just giving them too much thought and not going with my first instinct, and that sort of cost me.' McIlroy, the defending Masters champion and a two-time Players Championship winner (2019, 2025), expressed confidence in his game, noting it is 'in really good shape' and 'much better than it did in Dubai.' His upcoming events include the Arnold Palmer Invitational and The Players Championship, where he aims to build on recent progress.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 04:30 PM\nSource:[Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/golf/rory-mcilroy-golf-pga-snub-36774640)\n\n**Scottie Scheffler's first-round struggles prove capability of world No. 1 - CBS Sports**\nScottie Scheffler, the world No. 1 on the PGA Tour, has struggled in the first round of tournaments during the 2026 season, ranking 116th in Round 1 scoring average despite leading the tour in overall scoring average. At the Genesis Invitational, Scheffler started 5 over through his first 10 holes, made an 8-foot par putt on the 36th hole just to avoid missing the cut, and finished T12 alongside Jordan Spieth\u2014despite his slow start. This performance continued a pattern: he opened with a 73 at the WM Phoenix Open, finishing one stroke short of a playoff, and a 72 at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, where he closed with a 63 and three final-round eagles, falling two strokes short of Collin Morikawa. Scheffler has won twice at player-hosted signature events (Arnold Palmer Invitational and Jack Nicklaus Invitational), but remains without a victory at the Tiger Woods-hosted event. His ability to rally\u2014playing his final 62 holes in 16 under par at the Genesis Invitational\u2014has highlighted his resilience, with Rory McIlroy noting the growing importance of these player-hosted invitationals. Despite early struggles, Scheffler remains the favorite across all four majors: 3-1 at the Masters, 19/5 at the PGA Championship, 16/5 at the U.S. Open, and 5-1 at The Open, per FanDuel. His comebacks underscore his elite capability, proving that his dominance is not limited to strong starts but also extends to overcoming adversity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 07:49 PM\nSource:[CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/scottie-scheffler-first-round-struggles/)\n\n**Cognizant Classic 2026 field: 5 big-name golfers missing ft.

Viktor Hovland, who finished T41 at the Genesis Invitational after a strong start, will miss the event.

After a slow start with a 5-over-par performance on his first 10 holes on Thursday, Scheffler rebounded with rounds of 66 on Saturday and 65 on Sunday, entering the final hole at even par. On the 18th hole, he missed a 21-foot birdie putt that would have moved him into the top 10, ending his streak. Despite the setback, Scheffler stated he remains focused on the present and does not set long-term goals, emphasizing his preparation for the season. The tournament was won by Jacob Bridgeman, a 26-year-old former Clemson player, who closed with a 18-under-par total of 266, securing his first PGA Tour victory by one shot over Rory McIlroy and Kurt Kitayama. Bridgeman led by six shots entering the final round and extended it to seven at one point before carding a 1-over 72 on Sunday to hold on for the win.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 12:35 PM\nSource:[Yardbarker](https://www.yardbarker.com/golf/articles/scottie_schefflers_personal_record_drops_back_to_zero_after_not_so_good_outing/s1_17768_43506335)\n\n**Rory McIlroy's Genesis Invitational behavior speaks volumes about Bryson DeChambeau dynamic**\nRory McIlroy's behavior at the 2026 Genesis Invitational has sparked speculation about his relationship with Bryson DeChambeau, a rivalry that has dominated golf headlines over the past two seasons. McIlroy defeated DeChambeau at the 2024 US Open, but DeChambeau avenged the loss by winning the 2025 Masters, where McIlroy reportedly barely spoke to him during the final round, citing focus on winning the Green Jacket. At the Genesis Invitational, McIlroy played alongside Jacob Bridgeman, who held a six-shot lead heading into the final round; McIlroy closed the gap to one shot on the 18th hole. The contrast in McIlroy\u2019s interaction with Bridgeman versus DeChambeau has drawn attention, raising questions about the nature of their professional relationship.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 12:29 PM\nSource:[Yardbarker](https://www.yardbarker.com/golf/articles/rory_mcilroys_genesis_invitational_behavior_speaks_volumes_about_bryson_dechambeau_dynamic/s1_17664_43506324)\n\n**'My game is in really good shape' - Rory McIlroy confident as Masters countdown begins with second-place finish in LA**\nRory McIlroy finished second at the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club, marking his 13th PGA Tour runner-up finish and signaling strong form ahead of the Masters, which he will defend in 44 days. Despite a six-shot deficit to Jacob Bridgeman, who claimed his maiden PGA Tour title with a one-over 72 to finish at 18-under-par, McIlroy posted a four-under 67 in the final round, tying for second with Kurt Kitayama. McIlroy noted his game is 'in really good shape,' citing only three bogeys in 72 holes and improved performance compared to his earlier struggles in Dubai. He expressed frustration over missed opportunities on the front nine and back nine of the tournament, particularly on the first 27 holes, where he failed to capitalize on chances. However, he described the West Coast Swing as 'really positive,' with a week off to fine-tune his game before the Arnold Palmer Invitational and The Players Championship. Bridgeman, who overcame a seven-shot lead to a one-shot margin on the final hole, made a par putt from three feet, nine inches after McIlroy's 30-footer on 18, and was celebrated by tournament host Tiger Woods, who said, 'You've got one on me,' referencing his own failure to win at Riviera. Bridgeman earned $4 million, a Genesis GV80 coupe, a three-year PGA Tour exemption, and a Masters debut. World number one Scottie Scheffler finished tied for 12th on 11-under, ending his top-10 streak at 18 consecutive events.

Bridgeman started the day with a six-shot lead, which expanded to seven after birdies on the first and third holes, but he recorded no further birdies, carding a one-over 72. His lead was reduced to one after a bogey from a greenside bunker at the 16th, and he narrowly made par from a bunker at the 17th. At the 18th, he hit his approach to 20 feet and made the crucial par putt to secure victory. Bridgeman admitted he felt nervous, especially after a 'sketchy' five-footer for bogey on 16. Rory McIlroy, who started six shots behind, shot a four-under 67 with five birdies, including a hole-out from a bunker, and finished tied for second. Kurt Kitayama, 33, posted a seven-under 64 with eight birdies to finish solo second. Adam Scott, the 2020 Riviera winner, shot an eight-under 63 to finish fourth at 268. McIlroy praised Bridgeman\u2019s composure under pressure, noting the difficulty of closing out tournaments. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, despite a six-under 65, saw his streak of 18 consecutive top-10 finishes end with a tie for 12th at 11-under. Meanwhile, Tiger Woods, 50, hinted at a possible return to professional golf at the upcoming Masters, saying 'There is' when asked if he could play, though he has not competed since the 2024 Open Championship due to disc replacement and Achilles surgery.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 06:40 AM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/golf/jacob-bridgeman-hangs-on-to-claim-first-pga-tour-title-at-riviera)\n\n**Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy Lead 2026 Masters Odds Just Under 2 Months Out - Bleacher Nation**\nAs the 2026 Masters approaches with less than two months remaining, DraftKings futures odds reflect Scottie Scheffler as the clear favorite at +300, with Rory McIlroy second at +600. Scheffler has recorded four consecutive top-10 finishes at Augusta National and has won two majors in 2025, including the PGA Championship and The Open Championship. McIlroy, the defending champion after his 2025 playoff victory over Justin Rose, completed his career Grand Slam and is viewed as a strong fit for Augusta. Behind them, players like Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau are listed at +1000, while Tommy Fleetwood, Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa, and Ludvig Aberg follow in the +1500 to +2600 range. Mid-tier options such as Justin Rose (+3000), Hideki Matsuyama (+3500), Jordan Spieth (+4000), and Brooks Koepka (+4000) offer value for multi-player bets. Longer shots like Patrick Cantlay (+5000), Will Zalatoris (+5500), and Akshay Bhatia (+6000) are considered potential sleepers. Key historical trends show that 9 of the last 11 Masters winners had played in at least three Masters prior, 8 had top-5 finishes, and all were in the world top 25. Greens-in-regulation performance has also been a recurring factor. The article advises bettors to act early on mid-tier players to lock in favorable odds and to practice responsible gambling by allocating 10\u201315% of their betting budget to futures and seeking help via the National Council on Problem Gambling at 1-800-522-4700 or ncpgambling.org.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 07:40 PM\nSource:[Bleacher Nation | Chicago Sports News, Rumors, and Obsession](https://www.bleachernation.com/betting/2026/02/17/masters-odds-2/)\n\n**Phil Mickelson Makes Bold Declaration About Anthony Kim's Future That Scottie Scheffler & Co. Won't Like**\nAnthony Kim, a 40-year-old golfer, won the 2026 LIV Golf Adelaide event by defeating top players Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau, marking his first LIV Golf victory and a career-best performance. This win, achieved after a 9-under 63 in the final round, propelled him up 647 spots on the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR), placing him under the 200th mark\u2014within the top-200. Phil Mickelson praised Kim's achievement in a tweet, calling it 'one of the best stories in sports' and stating that Kim 'deserves the opportunity' to compete in the majors, even suggesting he could challenge Scottie Scheffler and other top players. While Kim currently qualifies for major championships via OWGR ranking, he must reach the top-50 by April 2026 to play in the 2026 Masters Tournament. With three LIV Golf events remaining before Augusta, Kim will need strong finishes to secure his spot. His rise since joining 4Aces GC has been dramatic, both in performance and ranking, and his journey has inspired many, according to Mickelson.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 11:45 PM\nSource:[EssentiallySports](https://www.essentiallysports.com/golf-news-phil-mickelson-makes-bold-declaration-about-anthony-kim-s-future-that-scottie-scheffler-and-co-wont-like/)\n\n**See how players have qualified for the Masters**\nThe 90th Masters tournament, scheduled for April 9\u201312, 2026, in Augusta, Georgia, will feature players who qualified through various pathways.

Despite a slow start to his 2025 season\u2014partly due to an injury that caused him to miss The Sentry and delayed his rhythm\u2014Scheffler has entered The American Express in La Quinta, California, as part of a strategic early-season buildup. This move aims to sharpen his game before major tournaments intensify in February. His improved preparation, including enhanced ball speed and a full preseason, could help him regain peak form quickly. With rivals like Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Xander Schauffele, and LIV Golf stars Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm eyeing challenges in 2026, Scheffler\u2019s early-season decision may give him a competitive edge, potentially setting a strong tone for a historic campaign akin to Tiger Woods\u2019 2000 season, where Woods won nine times.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2026 02:01 PM\nSource:[HITC](https://www.hitc.com/scottie-schefflers-latest-decision-could-make-2026-even-tougher-for-his-rivals/)\n\n**Major Odds: Who Is Favored To Win Golf's Biggest Events In 2026?**\nIn the 2026 major golf tournaments, Scottie Scheffler is the clear favorite across all four events, according to current betting odds. At The Masters, Scheffler is listed at +300, followed by Rory McIlroy at +500, Xander Schauffele at +1100, and Bryson DeChambeau at +1200. The PGA Championship features Scheffler at +350, with McIlroy at +650 and Jon Rahm at +1200, despite Rahm's lack of major contention since joining LIV Golf. The U.S. Open odds mirror the PGA Championship, with Scheffler at +320, McIlroy at +650, and DeChambeau at +1000. At the Open Championship, Tommy Fleetwood is at +1400, with his home-course connection to Royal Birkdale raising hopes for a breakthrough win. Scheffler has never won a U.S. Open and has no prior experience at Shinnecock Hills, where the 2018 U.S. Open was held. The 2025 major season saw Scottie Scheffler win the PGA Championship and Open Championship, Rory McIlroy claim the Masters after 17 attempts, and J.J.

At the Masters (April 9\u201312, Augusta National Golf Club, Augusta, Ga.), Scottie Scheffler is favored by Bob Harig and John Schwarb, with Tommy Fleetwood (Jeff Ritter) and Bryson DeChambeau (Max Schreiber) also in contention. For the PGA Championship (May 14\u201317, Aronimink Golf Club, Newtown Square, Pa.), Jon Rahm is predicted by Harig, Viktor Hovland by Ritter, Scottie Scheffler by Schreiber, and Tommy Fleetwood by Schwarb. At the U.S. Open (June 18\u201321, Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, Southhampton, N.Y.), Brooks Koepka is picked by Harig and Schwarb, with Scottie Scheffler (Ritter) and Sam Burns (Schreiber) as alternatives. For the British Open (July 16\u201319, Royal Birkdale, Southport, England), Tommy Fleetwood (Harig), Robert MacIntyre (Ritter), Justin Thomas (Schreiber), and Jon Rahm (Schwarb) are the top contenders. The article notes that Scheffler is seen as a strong favorite across multiple majors, with several analysts citing his consistency and recent form. The predictions are based on player performance, historical results, and projected momentum heading into 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 12:22 AM\nSource:[Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/golf/predicting-who-win-golf-major-championships-2026)\n\n**Scottie Scheffler's Grand Slam, Tiger Woods to return and a huge year for LIV Golf in 2026 - The Mirror**\nThe year 2026 promises major developments in professional golf. Rory McIlroy completed his career Grand Slam by winning the Masters in April, becoming the first European to do so. Scottie Scheffler followed by winning the US PGA and then his third Major at the Open Championship held at Royal Portrush. Scheffler aims to win the US Open at Shinnecock Hills in June, his home Major. Phil Mickelson, now 55, needs only the US Open to complete his career Grand Slam, while Jordan Spieth still needs the US PGA. The PGA Tour and LIV Golf remain in a legal and structural standoff, with LIV Golf planning to expand to 72-hole events and increase field sizes to 57 players. The departure of five-time Major winner Brooks Koepka from LIV Golf is a significant blow, and his future playing destination remains uncertain, possibly involving a ban before rejoining the PGA Tour. LIV must now secure Bryson DeChambeau and other top players. The European Ryder Cup team\u2019s 2023 victory on US soil boosted confidence, with Bob McIntyre finishing second at the 2025 US Open and left-handers historically performing well at Augusta National. Ludvig Aberg, a rising star, has finished second and seventh in his first two Masters appearances. The biggest story could be Tommy Fleetwood, Europe\u2019s top points scorer at Bethpage Black, winning his home Open at Royal Birkdale. Two European players, Sergio Garcia, Ian Poulter, and Lee Westwood, are still appealing bans and fines from joining LIV Golf in 2024; from January 1, 2026, LIV no longer covers these fines. If they lose their appeal, they must pay large fines to remain eligible for the Ryder Cup, with Jon Rahm refusing to pay on principle. Tiger Woods, who has undergone three operations since his last tournament at the 2024 Open, is back in training after turning 50 on December 30, 2025, and is now eligible for the PGA Senior Tour. Woods could complete a Grand Slam of US titles by winning the US Senior Open in July 2026 and may return to the PGA Tour, with a possible appearance at the Genesis Open in February. Behind the scenes, Woods chairs the PGA Tour Future Competition Committee, tasked with designing a streamlined tour for 2027. He is expected to be named captain of the US Ryder Cup team for the 2027 event at Adare Manor, owned by his friend JP McManus, though no official announcement has been made as of December 2025. Woods stated, 'No one's asked me about it,' during his pre-Hero World Challenge interview.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/golf/golf-2026-scheffler-woods-liv-36475909)\n\n**Very early Masters 2026 odds, led by the usual suspects**\nRory McIlroy, who completed his career Grand Slam with a 2025 Masters victory, has not yet followed up with additional major wins, finishing 47th in the PGA Championship, 19th in the U.S. Open, and seventh at The British Open. Despite this, he remains a strong contender for the 2026 Masters, with early odds of +650\u2014second only to Scottie Scheffler at +350. No other player has odds shorter than 10-1, with Ludvig Aberg (+1200), Bryson DeChambeau (+1400), and Jon Rahm (+1400) rounding out the top five. Scheffler, seeking a return to form after winning the Masters in 2022 and 2024 and claiming two majors in the 2025 season, aims to add another title.

Scheffler has finished T8 or better in 10 consecutive starts and remains a top threat despite not yet winning a British or U.S. Open. Rory McIlroy, a Northern Ireland native and former Open champion, is listed at +700, benefiting from home crowd support, though his inconsistent form\u2014evidenced by a T47 and MC in recent majors\u2014raises concerns. His 2019 Open performance at Portrush included an opening 79, highlighting past struggles under pressure. Other top contenders include Jon Rahm (+1200), Bryson DeChambeau (+2000), and Xander Schauffele (+2500). Betting picks include Robert MacIntyre to win at +3500, leveraging his strong performances in tough conditions and a T6 at Royal Portrush in 2019; Tommy Fleetwood to finish top-10 at +210, capitalizing on his excellent recent Open form and a solo second-place finish at Portrush in 2019; and Scottie Scheffler as the top American at +225, offering better value than a direct win bet. Historical data shows McIlroy has six top-10s in his last nine starts, and Jon Rahm has been top-10 in three of his last four Opens. Shane Lowry, the 2019 winner, is at +3500 despite missing cuts in the U.S. Open and PGA and a T42 at Augusta. The article also explains how to read odds, noting that +450 means a $100 bet returns $550 in profit.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 11:26 AM\nSource:[oddsshark.com](https://www.oddsshark.com/golf/the-open-championship-odds)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on current reports as of February 25, 2026, here is a comprehensive overview of the top golfers' form, fitness, and betting markets heading into the April 2026 Masters Tournament at Augusta National.\n\n## Scottie Scheffler (World No. 1)\n\n**Recent Performance:** Scheffler remains the dominant force in golf despite some uncharacteristic early-tournament struggles. His remarkable streak of 18 consecutive top-10 finishes ended at the Genesis Invitational, where he finished T-12 after a final-round 65 narrowly missed moving him into the top 10 [4][7]. He has shown a pattern of slow starts this season\u2014ranking 116th in Round 1 scoring average despite leading the tour in overall scoring [6]. At the Genesis Invitational, he was 5-over through his first 10 holes but rallied to play his final 62 holes in 16-under-par [6]. He has won twice at signature events this season (Arnold Palmer Invitational and Jack Nicklaus Invitational) but remains winless at Tiger Woods-hosted events [6].\n\n**Injury Status:** No injuries reported.\n\n**Masters Betting Expectations:** Scheffler is the clear favorite across all four majors, with Masters odds of +300 (3-1) at DraftKings and FanDuel [6][13]. He has recorded four consecutive top-10 finishes at Augusta National and won two majors in 2025 (PGA Championship and The Open Championship) [13].\n\n## Rory McIlroy (Defending Masters Champion)\n\n**Recent Performance:** McIlroy enters the Masters defense in strong form, having just finished runner-up at the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club, one shot behind Jacob Bridgeman [9][10]. He posted a bogey-free 64 in the final round at Pebble Beach earlier this season and currently leads the PGA Tour in strokes gained approach, surpassing Scheffler [5]. McIlroy has expressed confidence, stating \"my game is in really good shape\" after making only three bogeys in 72 holes at Riviera [9]. He will skip the Cognizant Classic to focus on his Masters defense, which begins in approximately 44 days [9][11].\n\n**Injury Status:** No injuries reported.\n\n**Masters Betting Expectations:** McIlroy is the second favorite at +600 (6-1) [13]. As the 2025 Masters champion, he completed his career Grand Slam and is viewed as an excellent fit for Augusta National [13]. However, recent reports suggest potential caddie concerns, with McIlroy implying that his current caddie Harry Diamond may be hindering his ability to compete with Scheffler's level, referencing how Ted Scott intervened during Scheffler's Olympic victory [1].\n\n## Jon Rahm\n\n**Recent Performance:** Rahm has been competing on the LIV Golf circuit and recently finished second to Anthony Kim at the LIV Golf Adelaide event in Australia [17]. During that tournament, Rahm shot a nine-under 63 at The Grange Golf Club to take the halfway lead on 13-under-par, making 151 feet of putts with an eagle and seven birdies [18]. He remains a consistent threat in major championships.\n\n**Injury Status:** No injuries reported.\n\n**Masters Betting Expectations:** Rahm is listed at +1000 (10-1) alongside Bryson DeChambeau [13]. He has been named to the European Ryder Cup team as a captain's pick for the 2025 matches at Bethpage Black [20].\n\n## Bryson DeChambeau\n\n**Recent Performance:** DeChambeau faces growing concerns about his final-round performance under pressure. He lost to Anthony Kim at LIV Golf Adelaide, continuing a troubling trend where he has recorded 11 rounds over par in 2025, including six in final rounds [15]. This pattern mirrors his struggles at the 2024 Masters, where he finished six shots worse than his previous three final rounds [15]. Despite winning the 2024 US Open over McIlroy, he has only one LIV Golf win since 2024 [15].\n\n**Injury Status:** No injuries reported.\n\n**Masters Betting Expectations:** DeChambeau is listed at +1000 (10-1) [13]. Phil Mickelson has publicly stated that players like DeChambeau (and Rahm) should be allowed to compete in majors, though their LIV Golf status creates qualifying complications [19].\n\n## Other Top Contenders\n\n**Collin Morikawa:** Currently second on the PGA Tour money list with $4.2 million in earnings [3]. Masters odds at +2600 [13].\n\n**Xander Schauffele:** Listed at +1500 to +2200 for the Masters [13][16].\n\n**Tommy Fleetwood:** Masters odds around +1500 to +2400 [13][16].\n\n**Hideki Matsuyama:** The 2025 Genesis Invitational champion (held at Torrey Pines due to wildfires) is listed at +3500 [13][16].\n\n**Jacob Bridgeman:** The current PGA Tour money leader ($5.2 million) and Genesis Invitational winner has qualified for his first Masters [3][9].\n\n**Anthony Kim:** The remarkable comeback story\u2014Kim won LIV Golf Adelaide with a final-round 63, defeating both Rahm and DeChambeau, and jumped 647 spots in the world rankings [17]. He needs to reach the top-50 by April to qualify for the Masters [17].\n\n**Tiger Woods:** Now 50 years old, Woods has hinted at a possible return to professional golf at the upcoming Masters, stating \"There is\" when asked if he could play, though he has not competed since the 2024 Open Championship due to disc replacement and Achilles surgery [10].\n\n## Augusta National Course Changes\n\nThe club has lengthened the 17th hole (Nandina) by approximately 10 yards to 450 yards total, repositioning the tee markers to increase difficulty [14]. McIlroy has publicly criticized this change as \"horrible,\" noting it forces players to use longer clubs and disrupts the traditional challenge [12].\n\n## Summary of Betting Markets\n\nAccording to DraftKings and FanDuel as of mid-February 2026:\n\n- **Scottie Scheffler:** +300 (3-1) [13]\n- **Rory McIlroy:** +600 (6-1) [13]\n- **Jon Rahm:** +1000 (10-1) [13]\n- **Bryson DeChambeau:** +1000 (10-1) [13]\n- **Tommy Fleetwood:** +1500 [13]\n- **Xander Schauffele:** +1500 [13]\n- **Ludvig \u00c5berg:** +2600 [13]\n- **Collin Morikawa:** +2600 [13]\n- **Justin Rose:** +3000 [13]\n- **Hideki Matsuyama:** +3500 [13]\n- **Jordan Spieth:** +4000 [13]\n\nHistorical trends suggest that 9 of the last 11 Masters winners had played in at least three Masters prior, and all were ranked in the world top 25 [13]. With McIlroy seeking to become only the fourth player to win back-to-back Masters (joining Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, and Tiger Woods), and Scheffler chasing his first green jacket since 2024, the 2026 tournament promises significant storylines [11].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
