Key finishes:\n\n| Pos | Player | Total |\n|-----|--------|-------|\n| 1 (playoff) | Rory McIlroy | -11 |\n| T1 | Justin Rose | -11 |\n| 3 | Patrick Reed | -9 |\n| 4 | Scottie Scheffler | -8 |\n| T5 | Bryson DeChambeau | -7 |\n| T5 | Sungjae Im | -7 |\n| 7 | Ludvig \u00c5berg | -6 |\n| T14 | Jordan Spieth | -3 (rounds included 69 on Saturday) |\n| T21 | Viktor Hovland | \u2014 |\n\nMcIlroy led by two after 54 holes but bogeyed the 72nd hole, forcing the playoff. He birdied the 17th playoff hole to win. Spieth complained post-round about mud balls affecting his iron play, noting Augusta National discourages players from discussing the issue publicly (New York Post, April 2025).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Masters History (2020\u20132025): Key Players\n\n### Scottie Scheffler\n- **2020:** Not in field (COVID year, November; non-exempt)\n- **2021:** T21\n- **2022:** T3\n- **2023:** **WON**\n- **2024:** **WON** (back-to-back)\n- **2025:** 4th (-8)\n\nScheffler is the two-time defending champion and world No. 1 entering 2026. His 2025 result (4th) demonstrates continued elite Augusta form even in a non-winning year. Per the 2026 Genesis Invitational field rankings (Golf News Net, February 16, 2026), Scheffler remains ranked No. 1 in the world. Bold predictions for 2026 from Golfweek (January 2026) suggest Scheffler could win a third Masters and complete the career Grand Slam by also winning the US Open at Shinnecock.\n\n### Rory McIlroy\n- **2020:** T5\n- **2021:** T12\n- **2022:** T2\n- **2023:** T2\n- **2024:** T2\n- **2025:** **WON** (playoff)\n\nMcIlroy is ranked No. 2 in the world as of February 2026 (Golf News Net). As the 2025 champion, he holds a lifetime invitation. Back-to-back Masters wins are historically rare (Tiger Woods 2001\u201302 being the modern benchmark). His 2025 win was aided by sports psychologist Bob Rotella's mental framework.\n\n### Jon Rahm\n- **2020:** T3\n- **2021:** T27\n- **2022:** T2\n- **2023:** **WON**\n- **2024:** T22\n- **2025:** T14 (-3)\n\nRahm confirmed in October 2025 that he would not play competitively until February 2026 (Golf Monthly). He claimed the LIV Golf Individual title for the second consecutive season in 2025, but it was his first winless year on any tour. His LIV affiliation limits OWGR accumulation but he retains Masters eligibility as a past champion. His 2025 Masters showing (T14, finishing with rounds of 70-69 on the weekend) suggests continued Augusta competitiveness.\n\n### Bryson DeChambeau\n- **2020:** T34\n- **2021:** T46\n- **2022:** T29\n- **2023:** T6\n- **2024:** T6\n- **2025:** T5 (-7)\n\nDeChambeau's Augusta trajectory is clearly upward. He led McIlroy by two entering the final round of the 2025 Masters before a closing 75 (+3) dropped him to T5. He participated in the 2025 Ryder Cup (USA), halving his singles match against Matt Fitzpatrick after being down five through seven holes (USA Today, September 2025).\n\n---\n\n## 3. 2025\u201326 Injury, Coaching & Equipment Changes\n\n### Viktor Hovland \u2013 **Neck Injury (Confirmed)**\nHovland aggravated a neck injury during the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black (September 2025), forcing him to withdraw from his Sunday singles match against Harris English. He subsequently limited his playing schedule, missing the DP World Tour Playoffs (Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship) in late 2025 (Golf Monthly). He did play the DP World India Championship (T6). As of February 2026, Hovland is ranked 15th in the world and is in the Genesis Invitational field, suggesting recovery.\n\n### Jordan Spieth \u2013 **Wrist and Shoulder/Neck Issues (Confirmed)**\nSpieth underwent wrist surgery requiring him to miss the second half of 2024 (ECU tendon injury from May 2023). In 2025, he encountered shoulder and neck trouble, forcing him out of the Travelers Championship and Genesis Scottish Open. He played all four 2025 majors (best: T14 at Masters). As of July 2025, Spieth declared himself \"injury free\" and predicted 2026 would be \"as good as I've ever been\" (Golf Magic, July 30, 2025). He is ranked 51st in the world as of mid-2025 but is in the 2026 Genesis Invitational field, confirming his return to full competition.\n\n### Jon Rahm \u2013 **Competitive Break (Confirmed)**\nRahm confirmed no competitive play until February 2026 (Golf Monthly). No injury cited; appears to be a scheduled rest period.\n\n### Scheffler, McIlroy, DeChambeau\nNo injury news found for any of these three players in the current search results. All three are confirmed in the 2026 Genesis Invitational field (Golf News Net, February 16, 2026), confirming full fitness entering the 2026 season.\n\n### Tommy Fleetwood \u2013 **2025 Tour Championship Win**\nFleetwood won his first PGA Tour title at the 2025 Tour Championship (Today's Golfer, February 2026), a significant development. He is ranked 4th in the world as of February 2026 (Golf News Net) and is described as \"in fine shape\" heading into the Genesis Invitational.\n\n---\n\n## 4. OWGR Rankings as of February 2026\n\nPer the 2026 Genesis Invitational field rankings (Golf News Net, February 16, 2026):\n\n| Rank | Player |\n|------|--------|\n| 1 | Scottie Scheffler |\n| 2 | Rory McIlroy |\n| 3 | Justin Rose |\n| 4 | Tommy Fleetwood |\n| 5 | Chris Gotterup |\n| 6 | Russell Henley |\n| 7 | J.J. Spaun |\n| 8 | Robert MacIntyre |\n| 9 | Ben Griffin |\n| 10 | Xander Schauffele |\n| 11 | Hideki Matsuyama |\n| 15 | Viktor Hovland |\n| 19 | Collin Morikawa |\n| 20 | Ludvig \u00c5berg |\n| 21 | Cameron Young |\n| 23 | Matt Fitzpatrick |\n| 30 | Patrick Cantlay |\n| 32 | Corey Conners |\n\n*Note: Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau are not listed in this field (LIV players), but both retain Masters eligibility.*\n\n**Notable ranking observations:**\n- Justin Rose's rise to No. 3 is remarkable given his T1 at the 2025 Masters (playoff loss to McIlroy)\n- \u00c5berg has dropped to No. 20 from a higher position, possibly reflecting limited schedule\n- Morikawa at No. 19 despite elite ball-striking metrics\n- Spieth at approximately No. 51 (mid-2025 data; likely improved by February 2026 given his stated return to health)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Top OWGR Contenders Without a Masters Win (February 2026)\n\n| Player | OWGR (Feb 2026) | Masters Best | Notable |\n|--------|----------------|--------------|---------|\n| **Tommy Fleetwood** | 4 | T21 (2025) | Won 2025 Tour Championship; first PGA Tour win |\n| **Xander Schauffele** | 10 | T8 (2025) | 2024 PGA Championship & Open champion |\n| **Viktor Hovland** | 15 | T21 (2025) | Recovering from neck injury |\n| **Collin Morikawa** | 19 | Multiple top-10s | Won 2026 Pebble Beach (AT&T); elite tee-to-green |\n| **Ludvig \u00c5berg** | 20 | T2 (2024), 7th (2025) | Two top-7 in first two Masters starts |\n| **Cameron Young** | 21 | \u2014 | Emerging contender |\n| **Matt Fitzpatrick** | 23 | Multiple top-25s | Strong iron play; 2022 US Open champion |\n| **Patrick Cantlay** | 30 | Top-25 range | Elite tee-to-green |\n| **Corey Conners** | 32 | T8 (2025) | Top-10 in 3 of last 5 Masters |\n| **Jordan Spieth** | ~51 | **WON (2015)** | Needs Masters for career Grand Slam; returning from injury |\n| **Bryson DeChambeau** | LIV (unranked) | T5 (2025) | Clear upward Augusta trajectory |\n\n**Key development:** Collin Morikawa won the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am (Today's Golfer, February 2026), ending a \"two-and-a-half-year battle\" with his game. This is a significant form indicator given Augusta's premium on approach play, where Morikawa excels.\n\n**\u00c5berg** remains the most compelling emerging Augusta contender: T2 on debut (2024), 7th in second start (2025) \u2013 historically elite form for a player in his first two Masters appearances.\n\n**Spieth** carries the Grand Slam narrative (needs only Masters) and has declared himself healthy for 2026. Golfweek's bold predictions (January 2026) specifically cite Spieth winning the 2026 PGA Championship to complete his Grand Slam, though the Masters remains his most historically relevant major venue.\n\n---\n\n## 6. 2025 Ryder Cup Context (September 2025)\n\nEurope defeated the USA 15-13 at Bethpage Black (USA Today, September 2025). Key Augusta-relevant performances:\n- **Scheffler** defeated McIlroy 1-Up in Sunday singles (Scheffler's putting was noted as a weakness on Bethpage Black)\n- **\u00c5berg** won 2&1 over Cantlay \u2013 the only European to win outright on Sunday\n- **DeChambeau** halved with Fitzpatrick after being down 5 through 7\n- **Hovland** withdrew with neck injury (half-point each)\n- **Schauffele** defeated Rahm 4&3 in singles\n\n---\n\n## 7. 2026 Masters Outlook\n\n**Scheffler** (World No. 1) is the clear favorite as two-time defending champion with a 4th-place finish in 2025. His tee-to-green dominance aligns perfectly with Augusta's demands. No injury concerns.\n\n**McIlroy** (World No. 2) returns as defending champion with career Grand Slam completed. Historical precedent makes back-to-back wins unlikely but not impossible.\n\n**Fleetwood** (World No. 4) is a new and significant contender after winning the 2025 Tour Championship for his first PGA Tour win. His correlation with Augusta-style courses (approach play, course management) makes him a genuine threat.\n\n**Morikawa** (World No. 19) winning at Pebble Beach in early 2026 signals a return to form. His elite approach play is the single most important Augusta skill, and a healthy, confident Morikawa is dangerous.\n\n**\u00c5berg** (World No. 20) with two top-7 finishes in his first two Masters starts is historically elite. At 24 years old, he is approaching his prime.\n\n**DeChambeau** (LIV, unranked OWGR) has the most compelling Augusta improvement trajectory of any player without a win there, going from T34 in 2020 to T5 in 2025.\n\n**Spieth** (returning from injury, ~No. 51) is a wildcard \u2013 if healthy and in form, Augusta is his most favorable major venue and he needs it for the career Grand Slam.\n\n**Rose** (World No. 3) after his 2025 playoff appearance is a legitimate contender, though his ranking may reflect recency bias from that single result.</Agent_report>\n"
