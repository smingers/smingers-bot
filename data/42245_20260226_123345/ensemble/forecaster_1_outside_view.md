Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **UN News (Jan 2024)** – High-quality source citing IOM data directly. Reports annual Mediterranean deaths: 2021: 2,048; 2022: 2,411; 2023: 3,041. Factual, reliable.

2. **ETIAS article (2025)** – Secondary source summarizing Frontex/IOM data. States 555 Mediterranean deaths in Jan–Apr 2025 (first four months). This is a key data point. Moderate reliability (secondary aggregator), but the specific IOM figure is credible.

3. **UN News (June 2025)** – High-quality source. Mentions 32,000+ cumulative Mediterranean deaths since 2014. Not directly relevant to Jan–Apr figures.

4. **Context/TRF article** – Thomson Reuters Foundation, high reliability. States 2023: 3,155 deaths; 2024: 2,573 deaths (full year). Notes death rate increased in 2024 despite fewer crossings.

5. **Agent Report** – Synthesizes multiple sources. Key finding: **606 deaths/disappearances recorded in Mediterranean between Jan 1 and Feb 22, 2026** — described as "the deadliest start to a year since IOM began recording in 2014." This is the most critical data point. The Guardian (Feb 23, 2026) is a high-quality source. The agent also notes 555 deaths in Jan–Apr 2025 (Mediterranean + Atlantic combined, Q1 only per Guardian Apr 2025 — though ETIAS says 555 for full Jan–Apr 2025 Mediterranean specifically).

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are relevant:

- **Historical Jan–Apr Mediterranean death totals**: The most directly applicable class. Confirmed data: 2015 exceeded 1,000 before May; 2016 exceeded 1,000 before May; 2025 had ~555 deaths in Jan–Apr (Mediterranean). Full-year figures (2,000–3,000+) suggest Jan–Apr typically accounts for roughly 20–35% of annual deaths.

- **Years with >1,000 Mediterranean deaths before May**: Confirmed for 2015, 2016. Unknown for 2017–2024. Given full-year totals of 2,000–3,000, and assuming roughly uniform monthly distribution (though spring/summer is deadlier), Jan–Apr would typically yield ~650–1,000 deaths in recent high-mortality years.

- **2026 pace specifically**: 606 deaths by Feb 22 = ~37 days into the year. That's ~16.4 deaths/day. From Feb 22 to April 30 = ~67 more days. Even at half that pace (~8/day), that's ~536 more deaths, totaling ~1,142. At the same pace, ~1,100 more, totaling ~1,700.

The 2026 pace is described as the deadliest start since 2014 — this is a strong signal.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- The question resolves May 1, 2026. Today is Feb 26, 2026.
- The question asks about deaths recorded **before May 2026** (Jan 1 – April 30, 2026).
- As of Feb 22, 2026: 606 deaths already recorded (54 days into the year).
- Remaining period: Feb 23 – April 30 = ~67 days.
- Historical pattern: Mediterranean deaths tend to increase in spring as weather improves and crossings increase. March–April typically see higher death rates than January–February.
- The 2025 Jan–Apr total was ~555 (Mediterranean). The 2026 figure already exceeds that with two months still remaining.
- At the current pace of ~11 deaths/day (606/54 days), reaching 1,000 requires only ~36 more deaths per day × remaining days... wait: need 394 more deaths over ~67 days = ~5.9 deaths/day. The current pace is ~11/day, so even a significant slowdown would still reach 1,000.

**(d) Justification**

The key facts:
1. By Feb 22, 2026, 606 Mediterranean deaths already recorded — the deadliest start since 2014.
2. Need only 394 more deaths over ~67 days (Feb 23 – April 30) to reach 1,000.
3. Current pace: ~11 deaths/day. Required pace to reach 1,000: ~5.9/day.
4. Spring months (March–April) historically see increased crossings and deaths.
5. 2025 Jan–Apr had ~555 deaths total; 2026 is already well ahead.
6. Full-year totals of 2,000–3,000 in recent years suggest Jan–Apr typically contributes 500–1,000+ deaths.

The threshold of 1,000 requires roughly half the current death rate to continue for the remaining period. Given that spring typically accelerates crossings, this seems very likely. The main risks to a "No" outcome would be: a dramatic policy change, severe weather preventing crossings for extended periods, or a major data revision. None of these seem likely to reduce deaths by >50% from current pace.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate from confirmed historical data (2015, 2016 exceeded 1,000 before May; 2025 did not at ~555) suggests this is not automatic — but 2026 is already at 606 by Feb 22, which is unprecedented. The required additional deaths (394) over 67 days at a pace well below current rates makes this highly probable.

The probability of NOT reaching 1,000 would require deaths to essentially stop or dramatically slow — perhaps a 5–10% chance given uncertainty about data revisions, seasonal variation, or policy shocks.

Outside View Prediction: **93%**
