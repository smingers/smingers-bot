Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **The Independent (Feb 22, 2026)** – High-quality mainstream journalism. Key factual data: 567 deaths across all Mediterranean routes as of ~Feb 22, 2026; 501 on Central Mediterranean alone. IOM spokesperson quoted directly (identifiable expert). Opinions from Amnesty UK and MPs are advocacy, not data.

2. **The Guardian (Feb 23, 2026)** – High-quality journalism. Confirms 606 dead/missing as of Feb 23, 2026. IOM explicitly called this "deadliest start to a year since 2014." Factual and well-sourced.

3. **VisaHQ (Feb 24, 2026)** – Commercial source, lower credibility, but cites IOM directly (602 deaths). Consistent with Guardian figure. Treat as corroborating, not primary.

4. **BBC (Feb 9, 2026)** – High credibility. Reports 53 dead from single Libya incident; ~500 total Mediterranean deaths by Feb 9. IOM cited directly.

5. **Le Monde (Feb 12, 2026)** – High credibility. 524 deaths by Feb 10, 2026. Comparative data: 2025 had 219 deaths by same date; 2016 had 416. IOM spokesperson quoted.

6. **AskNews aggregation (multiple Italian/international sources, Feb 23-26, 2026)** – Synthesizes multiple independent sources. Consistent figure of 606 deaths by Feb 23-25, 2026. Central Mediterranean alone: 501-503 deaths. Multiple independent sources corroborate. Reliable.

7. **UN News (Feb 23, 2026)** – Highest institutional credibility. Confirms 606 deaths, calls for enhanced rescue. Factual.

8. **Folha de S.Paulo, N-tv, Anadolu Agency, watson.ch (Feb 23-25, 2026)** – All cite IOM data, consistent with 606 figure. Corroborating.

**Key factual takeaways**: As of Feb 23-26, 2026, IOM confirms ~606 Mediterranean deaths. This is the highest comparable early-year figure since records began in 2014. The second-highest was ~427 in 2015.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence (large shifts warranted):**

- **606 deaths confirmed by Feb 23, 2026** (multiple independent, highly credible sources: IOM, Guardian, UN News, BBC). This is already 60.6% of the 1,000 threshold with ~65 days remaining until April 30. This is extraordinarily strong evidence.

- **Historical comparison**: Le Monde provides explicit comparative data: by Feb 10, 2026 = 524 deaths vs. 2025 = 219 deaths and 2016 = 416 deaths for the same period. 2016 was the second-deadliest year ever (5,136 total). 2026 is already running ~26% ahead of 2016's pace at the same point.

- **IOM explicitly states this is the "deadliest start to a year since 2014"** – this is a direct institutional assessment from the primary data source.

- **Structural factors**: Stricter enforcement pushing migrants to riskier routes (IOM spokesperson); fewer arrivals but higher death rates per crossing; spring crossings historically increase in volume.

**Moderate evidence:**

- **Pace of accumulation**: 606 deaths in ~54 days = ~11.2 deaths/day. To reach 1,000 by April 30 (~65 more days), only ~394 more deaths needed = ~6.1 deaths/day. The required pace is roughly half the current pace. Even a significant slowdown would still reach the threshold.

- **Spring effect**: March-April historically see increased crossing attempts as weather improves, which typically increases both arrivals and deaths. This supports continued accumulation.

- **Undercount warning**: IOM and Emergency note that ~1,000 additional missing persons (from Cyclone Harry) may not be fully captured yet. If even partially included, the threshold is already near or exceeded.

**Weak evidence:**

- **Policy deterrence**: Italy's naval blockade bill and EU asylum rule changes could theoretically reduce crossings. However, IOM data shows deterrence historically increases death rates per crossing without reducing overall mortality.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Timeframe**: Feb 26 to April 30, 2026 = ~63 days remaining.
- **Current status**: ~606 deaths by Feb 23 (essentially the start of the resolution window per the question's opening date of Feb 26). Wait—critical point: the question resolves based on the **year-to-date sum through end of April 2026**, not just deaths from Feb 26 onward. The resolution criteria says "year-to-date sum of dead plus missing through the end of April 2026." This means January and February deaths count toward the total.
- With 606 deaths already recorded and ~63 days until resolution, only 394 more deaths are needed.
- **If timeframe halved** (resolution by ~March 28): At ~11 deaths/day, ~693 additional deaths would occur, reaching ~1,299 total. Still very likely to resolve Yes.
- **If timeframe doubled** (resolution by ~July): Even more certain to resolve Yes.
- The question is essentially: will ~394 more deaths occur in the Mediterranean over the next 63 days? At current pace, that would happen in ~35 days.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate of 18% was derived from a 12-year reference class where only 2015 and 2016 clearly crossed 1,000 deaths by April 30. However, current circumstances are **vastly different** from the average historical year:

1. **Already at 606 deaths by Feb 23** – the highest comparable figure ever recorded. The 2015 figure (second-highest) was ~427 by the same date. 2026 is running ~42% ahead of the previous record.

2. **Required additional deaths are modest**: Only 394 more deaths needed over 63 days. At current pace (~11/day), this would be reached in ~35 days. Even at half the current pace (~5.5/day), it would be reached in ~72 days (just barely outside the window). For the question to resolve No, deaths would need to essentially stop or drop to ~6/day for the entire remaining period.

3. **Historical analogy breaks down**: The reference class of 18% was based on years where early-year death rates were much lower. 2026 is structurally different: record early-year mortality, structural factors (stricter enforcement → riskier routes), and spring crossings approaching.

4. **Spring crossings**: March-April typically see increased crossing attempts as weather improves. This is a structural factor that would increase, not decrease, the death rate.

5. **IOM undercount**: The true toll may already be near or above 1,000 if the ~1,000 missing from Cyclone Harry are eventually recorded.

The base rate of 18% is rendered essentially non-analogous. The current situation represents a historically unprecedented pace that makes Yes resolution nearly certain barring a dramatic and sustained reversal.

**Probability calibration**: Given 606 deaths already recorded, needing only 394 more over 63 days at a pace that has been running at ~11/day, the probability of reaching 1,000 is very high. The main risks to a No outcome are: (1) a dramatic policy intervention that stops crossings entirely (extremely unlikely in 63 days), (2) a data revision that reduces the current count significantly (unlikely given multiple independent sources), or (3) a sustained period of zero crossings due to extreme weather (possible for a few weeks but not 63 days). I estimate these combined scenarios at ~5-8%.

**Probability Calibration**

Starting from 18% base rate, shifting dramatically upward due to:
- Already at 60.6% of threshold with 63 days remaining (+60 pp)
- Current pace requires only ~35 days to reach threshold (+10 pp)
- Spring crossing season approaching (structural factor) (+3 pp)
- IOM undercount warnings suggest actual total may be higher (+2 pp)
- Small residual uncertainty for dramatic policy/weather reversal (-5 pp)

Final estimate: ~92-95%

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will IOM record ≥1,000 Mediterranean migrant deaths/missing (year-to-date) through April 30, 2026? Current count: ~606 as of Feb 23.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 18% (only 2 of 12 years crossed threshold). Current circumstances are vastly different – already at 60.6% of threshold with 63 days remaining.

3. **Consistency check**: "93 out of 100 times, the IOM Mediterranean year-to-date count reaches 1,000 by April 30, 2026." This makes sense given 606 deaths in ~54 days and only 394 more needed.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - IOM confirms 606 deaths by Feb 23 (multiple independent sources) ✓
   - Current pace ~11 deaths/day; only 394 more needed over 63 days ✓
   - 2026 running 42% ahead of previous record early-year pace ✓
   - Spring crossings historically increase mortality ✓
   - IOM undercount warnings suggest true total may be higher ✓

5. **Blind spot**: A massive, sustained weather event or unprecedented enforcement success could halt crossings for 2+ months. Unlikely but possible; might shift probability down ~5 pp.

6. **Status quo**: Current trend continues → threshold reached in ~35 days. Status quo strongly favors Yes.

Probability: 95%
