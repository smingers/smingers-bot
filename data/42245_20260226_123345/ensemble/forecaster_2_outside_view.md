Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **UN News (Jan 2024)**: High-quality source citing IOM data directly. Reports annual Mediterranean deaths: 2021=2,048; 2022=2,411; 2023=3,041. Factual, reliable.

2. **Etias.com article (2025)**: Secondary source aggregating Frontex/IOM data. States 555 Mediterranean deaths in Jan–Apr 2025 (first four months). This is a key data point. Etias is a commercial site but cites IOM directly; moderate reliability.

3. **UN News (June 2025)**: Reliable source. Notes 32,000+ Mediterranean deaths since 2014 cumulatively. Limited direct relevance to Jan–Apr 2026 question.

4. **Context/TRF article**: High reliability (Thomson Reuters Foundation). Reports 2023: 3,155 deaths; 2024: 2,573 deaths (full year). Notes death rate increased in 2024 despite fewer crossings.

5. **Agent Report**: Synthesizes multiple sources. Key finding: **606 deaths/disappearances recorded in Mediterranean between January 1 and February 22, 2026** — described as "the deadliest start to a year since IOM began recording data in 2014." This is the most critical data point. Source is Guardian (Feb 23, 2026) — high reliability.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are relevant:

- **Historical Jan–Apr Mediterranean death totals**: Only 2015 (>1,700) and 2016 (>1,000 by May) are confirmed to have exceeded 1,000 before May. 2025 had ~555 deaths in the first four months (below 1,000). However, 2026 is already at 606 by Feb 22 — far ahead of 2025's pace.

- **Years with "deadliest start" characterizations**: 2015 saw a catastrophic April spike (800+ deaths in a single week). 2016 also exceeded 1,000 early. The 2026 pace (606 by Feb 22 = ~8.7 deaths/day) is described as unprecedented since 2014.

- **Full-year death totals as proxy**: Annual totals range from ~2,000–3,000+ in recent years. If deaths are distributed roughly evenly across months, ~4 months = ~33% of year = ~670–1,000 deaths. But deaths are NOT evenly distributed — spring/summer months tend to have higher crossings and deaths. Jan–Apr is typically lower than summer months.

The most suitable reference class: **Years where Mediterranean deaths exceeded 1,000 before May**, given the unprecedented early pace in 2026.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Question window**: February 26 to April 30, 2026 (approximately 63 days remaining from today).
- **Note**: The question resolution is based on year-to-date sum through end of April 2026, but the resolution window opens February 26, 2026. The question asks if the IOM dataset shows ≥1,000 dead+missing through end of April 2026.

Critical calculation:
- By February 22, 2026: 606 deaths recorded (per Guardian/Ground News)
- By February 26 (today): approximately 606 + (4 days × ~8.7/day) ≈ 641 deaths
- Deaths still needed to reach 1,000: ~359 more
- Days remaining until April 30: ~63 days
- Required daily rate to reach 1,000: ~5.7 deaths/day

The current pace (~8.7/day through Feb 22) would need to drop by ~35% to just barely miss the threshold. Even at half the current pace (~4.4/day), the total would reach ~917 by April 30 — close but below 1,000.

Historical context: Spring months (March–April) typically see increasing Mediterranean crossings as weather improves, often leading to higher death tolls. This suggests the pace is unlikely to slow dramatically.

**(d) Justification**

The 2026 Mediterranean death toll is already at a historically unprecedented pace. With ~641 deaths by Feb 26 and ~63 days remaining, reaching 1,000 requires only ~5.7 deaths/day — well below the current pace of ~8.7/day. Even accounting for:
- Potential weather improvements reducing crossings temporarily
- Possible policy interventions
- Seasonal variation (March can be variable)

The pace would need to drop by more than half to miss the threshold. Historical data shows that spring months (March–April) typically see increased crossings and deaths. The 2025 comparison (555 deaths in full Jan–Apr) shows that 1,000 is NOT always reached, but 2026 is tracking far above 2025.

The probability is very high. The main risks of "No" resolution:
1. A dramatic, sustained reduction in crossings (policy change, weather, etc.)
2. Data reporting delays or methodology changes
3. The current pace was driven by a few large incidents that don't recur

Given the unprecedented pace, the remaining requirement (359 more deaths in 63 days), and the historical tendency for spring to bring increased crossings, I assess this as highly likely to resolve Yes.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate of Mediterranean deaths exceeding 1,000 by April 30 in any given year appears to be roughly 2 out of ~12 years (2015, 2016) based on confirmed data — but this is misleading because 2026 is already at 641 deaths by Feb 26, which is far ahead of any prior year at this point. The 2025 figure of 555 for the full Jan–Apr period shows that 1,000 is not guaranteed, but 2026 is already above that total with two full months remaining.

The math strongly favors Yes: needing ~359 more deaths over 63 days at a current pace of ~8.7/day. The probability of the pace dropping below 5.7/day for the remainder of the period is low but not negligible (perhaps 10-15% chance of missing).

Outside View Prediction: 88%
