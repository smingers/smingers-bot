Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / alignment to resolution criteria  
Question resolves **Yes** if the **IOM Missing Migrants Project** public “Mediterranean” region page shows **dead + missing in 2026 through end of April (Jan 1–Apr 30)** totals **≥ 1,000** (checked at/after **2026-05-01**).

(a) Source analysis (what’s factual vs opinion; quality; timeliness)
- The Guardian (Feb 23, 2026): High-quality mainstream outlet; reports **606 dead/missing in the Mediterranean since start of 2026**, explicitly attributing to **IOM** and calling it the **deadliest start since 2014**. Mostly factual; policy comments (bishops/Meloni) are opinions.
- The Independent (Feb 22, 2026): Mainstream outlet; reports **567 Mediterranean deaths** as of publication; also “**501 on Central Med route**” early 2026. Some narrative framing; key numbers attributed to UN/IOM (factual).
- BBC (Feb 9, 2026): Very high reliability; covers specific shipwreck (53 dead) and cites **IOM** that **~500** had died/missing from Libya route so far in 2026 and **375 in Jan** (factual).
- Le Monde (Feb 12, 2026, partially paywalled): High-quality outlet; reports **524** deaths/missing Jan 1–Feb 10 and compares with prior-year same-period totals (factual, but partial access limits verification breadth).
- UN News / AFP syndicated pieces in AskNews (Jan 26; Feb 23–25, 2026): UN News is close-to-primary for IOM statements; AFP is strong wire. These reiterate **606 YTD**, **459 in January**, and describe “invisible shipwrecks” during severe weather (factual), plus IOM calls for SAR (expert opinion from identifiable org).
- Italian local/regional articles (TP24, La Repubblica, etc., Feb 25–26): Mixed quality but largely citing IOM/UNHCR; valuable mainly as corroboration of the same IOM figures and contextual reports (opinions from NGOs/politicians are not used as predictive facts).
- VisaHQ (Feb 24, 2026): Commercial/secondary; lower weight. Useful only insofar as it echoes IOM claims, but I treat it as redundant.

Bottom line: multiple independent, generally reliable sources converge on **~606 Mediterranean dead/missing by Feb 23** and **459 in January** from IOM—good enough to treat the early-2026 level as real and unusually high.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (big directional pull toward “Yes”):
- **Multiple independent sources (Guardian, UN News/AFP syndication, Independent) citing IOM**: ~**606 Mediterranean dead/missing by Feb 23**. This anchors a high starting point toward the 1,000 threshold.
- **IOM-reported January toll = 459** (AFP/UN News summaries): implies early-2026 is not merely “a bit high” but structurally extreme vs many prior years’ Jan–Apr totals.
- **Mechanism with persistence potential**: “invisible shipwrecks,” reduced rescue effectiveness in bad weather, and riskier routes (IOM statements). Not fully structural, but not a one-day blip either.

Moderate evidence (moderate pull toward “Yes”, but with uncertainty):
- Seasonality: crossings often increase into spring; even if death *rate* per crossing improves, volume can rise. (Historical pattern, but noisy year-to-year.)
- Route shift toward longer Libya→Crete legs (reported in several pieces) plausibly sustains higher lethality.

Weak / cautionary evidence (nudges toward “No” or reduces confidence):
- A meaningful portion of Jan’s spike appears linked to **Cyclone/Storm Harry** and exceptional winter conditions; if that was the main driver, deaths could revert toward “normal bad” levels in Mar–Apr.
- Potential **recording/reporting lag**: resolution depends on what the IOM dataset shows by May 1 for incidents through Apr 30; undercounting/late updates could matter at the margin.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- From today (2026-02-26) to end of April: **~63 days** remain in the counting window.
- If the remaining time were **halved** (~31 days left), reaching 1,000 would require a much higher daily toll; probability would drop materially.
- If the remaining time were **doubled** (through end of June), probability would rise toward near-certainty because only a modest continuation would clear 1,000.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside view base rate was **88%**. The inside view hinges on (i) how many are already recorded, and (ii) what run-rate is needed.

Key arithmetic (using the most-cited IOM figure):
- As of **Feb 23: 606** dead/missing (Mediterranean, all routes).
- Needed additional deaths Mar 1–Apr 30 (or roughly Feb 27–Apr 30) to reach 1,000: about **394** more beyond 606.
- That’s roughly **~6 deaths/day** over the remainder of the window.

What would produce “No”?
- A sustained drop to roughly **≤4–5 deaths/day** recorded over Mar–Apr (or substantial reporting lag that leaves the public dataset below 1,000 by May 1).
- This is plausible if January’s huge toll was storm-driven and if deterrence/interdiction sharply reduces departures in March–April, *and* rescue outcomes improve.

What would produce “Yes”?
- Even a “come down from January chaos” scenario still clears 1,000 if Mar–Apr averages around **6–7/day** recorded. Given (a) spring tends to raise attempt volume and (b) current policies may push riskier routes/conditions, I think **≥6/day recorded** is more likely than not.

Net: I modestly increase from 88% because the **starting point is already very high** and the remaining required run-rate is **not extreme**. I also avoid pushing too high because **January looks unusually concentrated** (storm/invisible shipwrecks) and **recording lag** is a real operational risk for this specific resolution rule.

Probability calibration
- Status quo / trend continuation (Jan–Feb pace persists even partially): comfortably **Yes**.
- Main downshift scenario (post-storm reversion + better conditions + fewer departures): could land in the **900–1,000** band, making “No” non-trivial.
- I settle at: **91%** (roughly a +3pt move from outside view), which feels like the right balance between “already >600” and “the next 2 months could be materially quieter and/or under-recorded.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: IOM MMP Mediterranean **2026 Jan 1–Apr 30** dead+missing **≥1,000** as shown on site by **May 1**.
2. Outside view base rate: **88%**.
3. Consistency check: **91 out of 100 times**, IOM’s recorded Mediterranean dead+missing through April 2026 is **≥1,000**.
4. Top evidence (3–5):
   - IOM-cited total **~606** by **Feb 23** (Guardian/UN/AFP repeats).
   - IOM-cited **459** deaths/missing in **January** alone.
   - Only **~394 more** needed across Mar–Apr (~**6/day**).
   - Spring typically increases crossing volume (seasonality).
5. Blind spot (most “silly in hindsight”): IOM public dataset updates slowly for March–April incidents, leaving the posted total <1,000 by May 1 despite true deaths exceeding it (would pull probability down ~10–15 pts).
6. Status quo outcome: conditions change slowly; absent a major enforcement/SAR shift, mortality likely remains high → supports “Yes”.

Probability: 91%
