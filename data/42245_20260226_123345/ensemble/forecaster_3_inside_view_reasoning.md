**Interpreting forecast criteria**

I’m trying to grasp the forecast requirements and how the resolution window works. It seems the opening date is crucial for counting deaths and missing persons, with only incidents from February 26 onwards being included. However, there's mention of year-to-date sums through the end of April 2026, which makes it a bit confusing. I need to focus on the specific criteria and ensure I apply the correct interpretation. This could significantly influence the data outcomes.**Analyzing date criteria for counting**

I’m figuring out the counting rules for this dataset. It appears I should only include incidents from February 26 to April 30, even though the year-to-date wording might suggest otherwise. There’s some contradiction with certain titles implying a broader timeframe while specific resolution criteria are more limiting. I need to prioritize specific criteria over general notes. However, the mention of events before the opening signifies they can be part of the count, which is usually fine for forecasting.**Exploring event counting rules**

I’m delving into the counting criteria and how they apply here. It looks like they don’t want to count past events to prevent forecasters from using known outcomes. However, it’s confusing because the year-to-date definition isn't clearly laid out. They specify that events before February 26 don’t count, so I think the cumulative sum should start from then. I need to pick an interpretation that follows their notes. The organizers might aim for clarity while balancing what's already known, but some ambiguity remains.**Considering forecasting probabilities**

I recognize that they seem to allow the use of past information since it would be strange otherwise. They provided data showing 606 deaths by February 22, which suggests they’re counting from January 1. So, I should consider that even if the user prompt insists on a different starting point. Now, the outside view has an 88% probability, and I need to adjust it based on current information. With evidence of around 606 deaths recorded by February 23, we need an additional 394 deaths by April's end. Calculating that rate shows it’s around 6 deaths a day. But I wonder if the pace will drop; winter storms might have caused spikes, while spring usually boosts activity but may lead to better rescue efforts, possibly reducing deaths.**Forecasting scenarios and probabilities**

I’m considering various factors that could impact migrant death counts. Political actions, like a naval blockade, might reduce departures, but historically, summer sees higher mortality due to increased crossings. The data revisions could lead to underreporting, making total deaths by April appear lower. 

If I model different scenarios based on historical daily rates, it could suggest high probabilities of exceeding the required death count. I’m thinking of adjusting the probability from 88% to around 91-92%, while keeping cautious about overconfidence. It seems essential to analyze sources to strengthen the findings before moving forward.
