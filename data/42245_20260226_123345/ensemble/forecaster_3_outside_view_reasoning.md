**Evaluating historical data for predictions**

I’m analyzing the note stating that events before the opening date don't count towards resolution. This makes calculating the counts a bit tricky. If we consider starting from February 26, I have to estimate reaching a threshold of 1,000 by the end of April. Looking at past data, I see about 555 in early 2025. By April 2026, the counts might exceed expectations based on historical trends. However, I should use pre-2026 information for a more reliable outside view. I'll have to approximate using yearly totals and seasonal patterns.**Analyzing death peak seasons**

I’m thinking about when deaths typically peak, which is usually in the summer. However, crossings are more common in the spring and summer, but early in the year can still see activity. In 2024, the total was 2,573, which means by the end of April, with even distribution, I’d expect around 858, but realistically that could be lower. Reaching 1,000 by the end of April would be unusual, possibly only happening during crisis years. Given the note about starting February 26, it seems even less likely to hit that mark without extreme circumstances.**Considering forecasting rates**

I’m evaluating the base rate for a high death count from late February to the end of April, which might be around 5-10%. The context includes a deadly start in 2026, but I should focus on historical data for a clearer outside view. Using 2025 data, I see about 555 deaths from January to April. To exceed 1,000 would require around 1.8 times that, likely making it a rare occurrence, perhaps happening 1 out of 8 times. If starting from February 26, the chance drops even more. This note adds confusion, but it’s crucial for understanding the forecast.**Clarifying timeframe for analysis**

The question specifies "before May 2026," which means I need to focus on the period leading up to the end of April. They're looking for a year-to-date sum through April for the Mediterranean of at least 1,000. However, the note about the opening date seems contradictory; it suggests excluding incidents before February 26. I need to make sure to follow the stated rules for my outside view. I'll conduct a thorough analysis using reliable sources for totals and context, adjusting my probabilities accordingly.**Evaluating mortality predictions**

I'm reviewing the agent report, which has mixed data, including a claim from a Guardian article about 606 deaths by February 22, 2026. I need to establish a reference class for deaths from February 26 to April 30. I’ll consider historical data, aiming for at least 1,000 deaths during this time. The average deaths from January to April in recent years suggest a low base rate for exceeding 1,000. With potential for mass casualties from disasters, I might estimate a 6% probability, ensuring clarity about the uncertainties involved while respecting the rules mentioned.
