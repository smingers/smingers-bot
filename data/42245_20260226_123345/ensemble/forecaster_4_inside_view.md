Analysis:
1. Source analysis (key items only – all February 2026 unless noted):
   • The Guardian & The Independent – mainstream, high-reliability newspapers quoting IOM spokespeople; factual numbers (606 Mediterranean dead/missing YTD) are near-primary and date-stamped.  
   • BBC & UN News – public-service and UN outlets; supply the 53-dead Libya wreck (9 Feb) and IOM’s 375 January tally. High data quality.  
   • Le Monde – pay-walled but quotes IOM; confirms 524 deaths by 10 Feb. Credible.  
   • TP24 / La Repubblica / ANSA / other Italian local media – first-hand reporting of bodies washing ashore; good for colour but numbers ultimately trace back to IOM. Medium reliability.  
   • AskNews compilation itself strings the above together; not an independent source.  

   Opinion separation: only the IOM, UNHCR and named maritime-policy experts are treated as substantive; NGO/clerical statements are viewed as advocacy (ignored for quantitative forecasting).

2. Evidence analysis (relative weight):
   Strong evidence  
   – IOM confirms 606 deaths/missing Jan 1–23 Feb 2026, the highest ever for that span.  
   – Historical IOM dataset shows mega-wrecks (>500 deaths) have happened (e.g., 18 Apr 2015 ~750; 14 Jun 2023 ~500) and, when they do, usually occur March-June.  
   – Structural reduction in state/NGO rescue capacity (Italian “naval blockade” law, EU asylum tightening) is already in force, plausibly raising per-crossing lethality.  

   Moderate evidence  
   – Early-2026 storms created an abnormally high daily death rate (~11/day); baseline for the next two months could remain higher than normal if crossings rise with better weather but rescue assets stay restricted.  
   – Economic push factors in Egypt, Libya & Tunisia suggest sustained demand for crossings.  

   Weak evidence  
   – Anecdotal reports of “up to 1 000 missing after Cyclone Harry” (unverified).  
   – Statements that the EU pact (effective June 2026) will worsen deaths – outside the forecast window.  

   Net effect: strong evidence the *background* death rate is elevated; only moderate evidence that a ≥500-fatality mega-wreck will occur in the 64-day window.

3. Timeframe analysis
   • Window that counts: 26 Feb – 30 Apr 2026 = 64 days.  
   • Needed pace: 1 000 / 64 ≈ 15.6 deaths per day.  
   • If the window were doubled (to 128 days), my probability would jump to ~35 %; halved (32 days) it would fall to ~3 %.

4. Justification / inside-view shift
   Outside-view base rate (from historical Jan-Apr performance *and* truncation rule): 7 %.  
   Updates pushing upward: record-high early-year mortality (+1.5 ppt), documented fall-off in rescue capacity (+0.5 ppt).  
   Updates pushing downward: storms—the major driver of January fatalities—have passed; mega-wrecks remain rare events (−0.5 ppt).  
   Resulting inside-view: 9 % that ≥1 000 deaths will be *recorded* between 26 Feb and 30 Apr.

Probability calibration
Subjective 90 % confidence interval for the true probability: 4 % – 18 %. 9 % represents the mean of my current belief distribution. “Yes” therefore occurs roughly 1 in 11 times under similar conditions.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “From 26 Feb to 30 Apr 2026, will IOM log ≥1 000 Mediterranean dead+missing?”  
2. Base rate stated: 7 %.  
3. Consistency line – 9 out of 100 times the 1 000-death mark is reached in this 64-day span.  
4. Key evidence (phrased shortly):  
   – 606 deaths already by 23 Feb (record).  
   – 64-day window requires 15.6/day.  
   – Average deadly-year baseline ≈7–9/day.  
   – Historical ≥500-death wrecks occur ~once every 6 years.  
   – Rescue capacity contraction.  
5. Blind-spot – Another April-2015-style mega-wreck (>800 dead) plus ordinary losses would bust my forecast; would raise probability to >50 %.  
6. Status-quo lean – Absent mega-wreck, trend lines point far below 1 000; slight nudge toward “No” retained in final number.

Probability: 9%
