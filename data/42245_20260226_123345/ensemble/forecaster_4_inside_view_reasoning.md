**Forecasting migrant deaths**

I need to produce a probability forecast for the IOM Missing Migrants Project, specifically regarding at least 1,000 Mediterranean migrant deaths in 2026 before May. There's a crucial detail: only deaths recorded after the forecast opening on February 26 will count. So, I can't include the 606 deaths from January 1 to February 23. I’m starting from an outside base probability of 7.4%. Given the high early-year deaths, I need to evaluate if we can expect another 400+ deaths in the window from February 26 to April 30.**Examining mass-casualty events**

The requirement for at least 1,000 deaths after February 26 is extremely rare, as large tragedies, like one resulting in over 300 deaths, only happen occasionally. Notably, there was a disaster with around 800 deaths off Libya on April 18, 2015, showing that reaching 1,000 in 64 days is possible if similar events occur. However, such mega-tragedies happen roughly once every few years.

I estimate the probability of a mass-casualty event with over 500 deaths in that timeframe to be about 3-4%. To reach 1,000 deaths, we would need significant events, as the current trend gives us a baseline of around 512 deaths without any extraordinary occurrences.**Modeling the probability**

I need to model the probability of migrant deaths from February 26 to April 30, estimating the baseline mortality at around 8 deaths per day, which totals to 512 over 64 days. This could potentially increase with more crossings, maintaining that baseline.

I approximate the chances of at least one mass tragedy of 500+ deaths at around 3%, and two smaller tragedies around 5%. Together, that gives me about 8%. However, I realize I need an additional 488 deaths to reach 1,000. The probability of extras surpassing that threshold is likely around 3-4%. Adjusting for high baseline mortality, I estimate the probability could drift to about 9%. Overall, I suspect our final estimate remains close to the original outside view of 7.4%, but with considerations for recent patterns, it might be reasonable to raise it slightly.**Crafting the output**

I need to format my output with sections: Analysis, Probability Calibration, Checklist, and the final Probability. I'm aiming for a final probability of about 9%. I'll raise it from the outside view of 7.4% based on factors like the high mortality baseline in 2026 and the effects of deterrence and rescue crackdowns.

For the analysis, I’ll summarize key sources like The Independent, Guardian, BBC, and Le Monde, evaluating the quality and recency of each. I must weight the evidence thoughtfully and analyze the 64-day timeframe. Then, I’ll develop a probability distribution and create a concise checklist. Finally, I'll package it all nicely into a message.
