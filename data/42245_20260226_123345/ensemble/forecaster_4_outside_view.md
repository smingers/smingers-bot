Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. UN News, 29 Jan 2024 – Factual yearly death totals 2021-2023 (2,048; 2,411; 3,041). Source is the UN press office (high institutional credibility). Contains advocacy quotes (Amy Pope, Amina Mohammed) that are opinions rather than data.  
2. Etias.com, May 2025 – Cites Frontex/IOM numbers for crossings and “555 deaths Jan-Apr 2025”. Commercial‐informational site, but the figures are explicitly attributed to IOM; taken as moderately reliable. Opinions from “Statewatch” are policy commentary, not data.  
3. UN News, 11 Jun 2025 – Mainly Red-Sea; Mediterranean reference is the long-run 32 000-death statistic. High-quality source; limited relevance to the four-month horizon.  
4. Context / Thomson Reuters Foundation, 2025 – Annual Mediterranean death totals for 2023 (3,155) and 2024 (2,573); high editorial standards. Opinions about “deadliest route” are descriptive.  
5. Agent report (Feb 2026) – Synthesises open-source snippets for 2014-2026 early-year tallies. Shows explicit 30 Apr values only for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2025; notes 606 deaths 1 Jan-22 Feb 2026. Provides citations so is auditable; treated as medium reliability because it is second-hand aggregation.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Potential reference classes:  
i. “Mediterranean migrant deaths ≥ 1,000 before 1 May” for each calendar year 2014-2025 (12 observations).  
ii. Correlation of full-year death totals with whether 1 May threshold is crossed (proxy when the 1 May figure is missing).  
Class i is preferred because it directly matches the event definition, even though data gaps exist; class ii would require extra assumptions.

From the available evidence:  
• Years certainly ≥ 1,000 by 30 Apr: 2015, 2016.  
• Year certainly < 1,000: 2014, 2025.  
• Remaining eight years lack explicit 30 Apr totals but full-year deaths were 1,449-3,155; the Etias 555 figure for 2025 implies that totals often stay under 1,000 through April even in 2,500-death years. Conservatively assume none of 2017-2024 definitely hit 1,000 by April.  
Base-rate estimate: 2 / 12 ≈ 17%.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 26 Feb 2026. Resolution date: 30 Apr 2026 – 64 days away. We need cumulative deaths from 1 Jan-30 Apr. Historically, the January-April share of full-year deaths has been:  
• 2014 ≈ 3% (96/≈3 300)  
• 2015 ≈ 45% (>1 700/≈3 770)  
• 2016 ≈ 20% (>1 000/≈5 100)  
• 2025 ≈ 24% (555/≈2 300)  
Large variation, but cracking 1 000 before May has been a minority outcome.

(d) Justification  
The outside view asks: disregarding this year’s specifics, how often does the event happen? Only two clear precedents (2015, 2016) in twelve years => ~17%. Unknown-data years could shift the figure a little either way, but several indicators (2025 example) suggest that sub-1,000 is more common even in moderately deadly years. Expert commentary does not contradict this. Hence a base probability in the high-teens seems reasonable.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor at 17%.  
• Source uncertainty (missing data 2017-2024) – widen credible interval slightly upward: +2 pp.  
• Typical “surprise” rate in migration statistics (unforeseen surges) – add +1 pp.  
Resulting calibrated outside-view probability: 20% - 3% = 19%? Actually we added upward 3 pp, so 17 % + 3 pp = 20 %. Apply a small prudence discount (over-rounding bias) -2 pp → 18%.

Outside View Prediction:
