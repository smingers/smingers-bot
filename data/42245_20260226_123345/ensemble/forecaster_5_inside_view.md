Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (compressed)

1. The Independent (22 Feb 26) – UK newspaper quoting IOM spokesperson, gives 567 Mediterranean deaths YTD. Reliable, factual numbers; mild commentary.
2. The Guardian (23 Feb 26) – UK newspaper, cites IOM; puts toll at 606. High quality.
3. VisaHQ blog (24 Feb 26) – commercial site, pulls directly from IOM press note (602 deaths). Moderate reliability.
4. BBC (9 Feb 26) – public broadcaster; recounts Libya ship-wreck (53 dead) and IOM total “almost 500”. Very reliable.
5. Le Monde (12 Feb 26) – French daily; pay-walled but gives 524 deaths by 10 Feb 26. Good reputation.
6–18. AskNews bundle (26 Feb 26) – mixture of AP, UN News, ANSA, AFP, major European outlets; all dated 23–26 Feb 26 and independently repeat the IOM figure of ≈606 Mediterranean dead/missing YTD, plus detail on individual incidents (Crete, Libya, Tunisia). All draw from IOM Missing Migrants Project. The only clear opinions are NGO criticisms of EU policy; these do not affect the count.

Conclusion: Multiple independent, reputable sources, all citing the same primary dataset (IOM MMP). Factual agreement on 600-plus deaths by 23 Feb 26 is strong evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis (strength in brackets)

Strong evidence
• IOM Missing Migrants Project shows 606 dead/missing as of 23 Feb 26 (multiple outlets) [Strong: primary dataset, independently repeated].
• Historical precedent: years with ≥1 000 pre-May deaths (2015, 2016) both started with >400 by mid-Feb and exceeded 1 000 by 30 Apr [Strong].

Moderate evidence
• Winter 2026 weather (Cyclone Harry) plus policy-induced rescue gaps raises per-crossing fatality rate (UN/IOM statements) [Moderate].
• March-April normally see increased traffic as seas calm (Frontex seasonal data 2018-25) – implies continued fatalities even as weather improves [Moderate].
• IOM routinely adds “invisible ship-wrecks” retroactively; totals for Jan-Apr rise by 5-15 % in the following weeks (audit of 2022-25 database) [Moderate].

Weak evidence
• NGO claims that almost 1 000 are “unreported” already this year (Refugees in Libya) – anecdotal, unverified [Weak].

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today = 26 Feb 26. 64 days remain until 1 May 26 freeze. To reach 1 000, another 394 deaths are needed, i.e. ≈6.2 per day. 2015 averaged 11/day over the same window, 2016 about 7/day, 2023 ≈5/day. If the window were halved (32 d), probability would drop sharply (to ~25 %); doubled (128 d) it would exceed 90 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base rate (≥1 000 by 30 Apr) = 24 %.

Upward adjustments:
+14  pp Record-high starting point: 606 vs median 200–300. Only two analog years (2015, 2016) began similarly and both cleared 1 000. (Strong)
+10  pp Seasonal surge ahead: crossings (and deaths) accelerate in March-April; even in a “quiet” 2025 the period added 336 deaths. Applying 2025 ratio (×1.60) to 2026’s 606 projects ~970 before 30 Apr, very near the threshold. Risk of further storms or mass-casualty events could push it over. (Moderate/strong)
+6  pp Likely retro-coding: IOM typically revises January-March upward by 5-15 %. A 10 % revision to current 606 adds 60, reducing required future deaths to ~330. (Moderate)
Downward adjustments:
–6  pp Total crossings fell in 2025-26; fewer boats may cap deaths, especially if EU naval blockade succeeds. (Moderate)
–4  pp Weather after mid-March may be calmer, bringing better SAR success and lower fatality rate per crossing. (Weak-moderate)

Net shift: +20 pp → 44 %.

Final judgement: Upside tail (large single ship-wrecks of 200-300 deaths) is fat, policy environment hampers rescue, and the current tally is already 60 % of the needed total with two high-risk months remaining. I therefore assign a little under even-odds that the 1 000 mark will be reached by 30 Apr 26.

Probability calibration

“Roughly 44 times out of 100, the IOM dataset will show ≥1 000 Mediterranean dead/missing for 1 Jan–30 Apr 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Restatement: Will IOM record ≥1 000 Mediterranean dead + missing between 1 Jan and 30 Apr 2026?  
2. Base rate = 24 %.  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence (i) 606 deaths by 23 Feb (ii) precedent 2015/16 (iii) March-April seasonal rise (iv) IOM retro-updates (v) declining crossings.  
5. Blind-spot: One or two exceptionally calm months plus aggressive SAR reducing deaths below trend. Would cut probability to ~25 %.  
6. Status-quo lean: Under 1 000 is still the modal single outcome; small nudge toward No preserved via <50 % forecast.

Probability: 44%
