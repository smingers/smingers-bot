**Forecasting mortality rates**

I need to develop a solid forecast based on the current situation. As of February 23, 2026, we have 606 deaths, with a goal of reaching 1,000 by the end of April. This means we need to account for 394 additional deaths over the next 59 days. If we look at historical data, during early months of previous years, the average was around 4.2 deaths per day. Despite potential winter hazards, improved weather might lead to more crossings, but better conditions could also reduce fatality rates. Let's keep analyzing those patterns!**Analyzing mortality probability**

Looking at historical data, 2016 and 2015 saw tragic peaks in early March-April, raising the question of whether 2026 could follow that trend. The current situation has already shown a record start with increased early tragedies, suggesting a high baseline risk. Factors like winter storms, ongoing smuggling patterns, and reduced rescue efforts point to a plausible daily fatality rate. I'll consider forecasting a probability of 55-65%. 

With 64 days remaining, IOM's data shows 606 recorded deaths, but past shipwreck counts may increase this, as they continuously update their dataset. I'll also keep in mind that incidents recorded later can change the probabilities as the end date approaches. 

So, let’s create an analysis, considering the timeframe and evidence, to develop a solid final probability.
