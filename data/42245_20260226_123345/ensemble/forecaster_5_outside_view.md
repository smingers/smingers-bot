Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. UN News, 29 Jan 2024 – Straight UN press-office reporting. 2021-23 annual Mediterranean death totals are factual figures taken from the IOM Missing Migrants Project. Opinion elements are quotes from Amy Pope and Amina Mohammed; these are advocacy rather than data. High source quality; data cut-off 31 Dec 2023.  
2. Etias.com, 2025 recap – Private visa-information site quoting Frontex and IOM. Gives a concrete IOM figure of 555 Mediterranean deaths in Jan–Apr 2025. Factual numeric content appears accurate and is sourced; moderate reliability. Dated May 2025.  
3. UN News, 11 Jun 2025 – Primarily Red-Sea story. Only useful fact is the running IOM total of “32 000+ deaths since 2014”. Adds little for our purpose. High reliability but low direct relevance.  
4. Thomson Reuters Foundation / Context, 2025 overview – Well-sourced feature. Gives annual totals for 2023-24 but no Jan–Apr subtotals. High reliability; published H2 2025.  
5. Agent report – A desk review of public records 2014-26. Collates the few instances where an explicit IOM 1 Jan–30 Apr Mediterranean subtotal is on record. Provides a table:  
   • 2014 = 96 (<1000)  
   • 2015 > 1700 (≥1000)  
   • 2016 > 1000 (≥1000)  
   • 2017-24 = no documented evidence of ≥1000 by 30 Apr  
   • 2025 = 555 (well <1000)  
   • 2026 = 606 to 22 Feb (preliminary)  
The report is transparent about information gaps; credibility is moderate to high because it cites primary articles but we have not seen the raw IOM database.

Factual nuggets we can trust:  
• Only 2015 and 2016 are confirmed years in which ≥1 000 deaths had already been recorded before May.  
• In a recent “typical” year (2025) the Jan–Apr total was 555.  
• Full-year totals 2021-24 were 2 000–3 000.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “All calendar years since 2014” – 12 data points. Only two confirmed successes => 17 % base rate. Weakness: many years lack explicit Jan–Apr totals, so the failure count may be overstated.  
2. “Years with full-year deaths ≥3 000” (2015, 2016, 2023) – 2/3 confirmed early-death years => 67 % base rate. Weakness: tiny N and assumes strong link between full-year and early-year intensity.  
3. “Post-COVID normal-mortality years 2021-25” – Only 2023 had an annual total above 3 000 and we have no evidence it cleared 1 000 by Apr 30. Empirical base rate ≈ 0 %.  
Given the incompleteness of itemised early-year data, reference class #1 is the least‐bad broad baseline; we will, however, adjust for the possibility that some unmeasured years did exceed 1 000.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are 64 days from the 30 Apr 2026 cut-off. Historically, deaths are front-loaded into the spring when seas calm. In the representative 2025 season the first four months produced ~28 % of that year’s deaths (555/≈2 000). To hit 1 000 in four months under a “normal” full-year total (~2 500) would require ~40 %. That occurred only in the 2015-2016 crisis.

(d) Justification  
1. Documented empirical base rate (≥1 000 by Apr 30) = 2/12 = 17 %.  
2. Undercount adjustment: assume one “unknown” year of the ten missing might have exceeded the threshold. Revised inferred base rate ≈ 3/12 = 25 %.  
3. Macro drivers 2017-25 included EU migration-control tightening, Libya/Tunisia departures fluctuating, but no multi‐month surge matching 2015-16. That suggests 25 % is already generous.  
4. Expert/market priors: none available, but humanitarian NGOs have repeatedly warned of steady, not explosive, death tolls.  
Therefore, before looking at any 2026-specific news, a reasonable outside-view probability that the 1 000-death mark will be crossed by 30 Apr 2026 is roughly one chance in four.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor – 25 % (from adjusted historical base rate).  
Upset frequency – Migration flows can spike rapidly when conflict or policy shocks hit; call it a medium‐volatility domain. Historical “surprise” years (2015, 2016) occurred 2 times in 12 = 17 %. That suggests we should not compress the tails too much.  
Round-off – Treat 25 % as point estimate but avoid false precision; nevertheless, we’re asked to be specific. I will state 24 % to reflect lingering uncertainty in the direction of slightly fewer hidden early-year surges than we assumed.
