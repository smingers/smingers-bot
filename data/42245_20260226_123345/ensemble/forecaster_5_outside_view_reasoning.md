**Conducting analysis on migrant deaths**

I need to summarize each information source, including web articles and reports, while evaluating their quality and dates. It's important to separate facts from opinions. I should look into reference classes like Mediterranean migrant deaths over the past years, especially focusing on early-year tolls. Regarding the timeframe, we have around 64 days from February 26 to April 30, 2026. The analysis should rely on historical data for a baseline, so I'll aim to incorporate figures without focusing too much on current projections.**Estimating outside view predictions**

I'm realizing that I need to focus on generating outside view predictions for this analysis. This means I'll rely heavily on base rates from previous years rather than incorporating the early 2026 figures too strongly. My data from 2015 and 2016 shows the threshold was exceeded by April 30, but I don't have that information for other years. I can estimate proportions based on previous annual totals, particularly looking at early-year shares, which seem to average around 25%. Based on that, I think the baseline probability of reaching the threshold might be around 20-25%. Now, it’s time to craft the final analysis.
