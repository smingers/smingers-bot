Disagreement Analysis:

The forecasters split into three clusters: high confidence Yes (forecasters 1, 2, 3 at 91-96%), moderate probability (forecaster 5 at 44%), and low probability (forecaster 4 at 9%). The spread is enormous (9% to 96%), driven by three key disagreements:

**Disagreement 1: Does the resolution window start January 1 or February 26?**
This is the single most consequential disagreement. Forecasters 1, 2, 3 interpret the resolution criteria as counting the **year-to-date** sum (Jan 1 – Apr 30), meaning the ~606 deaths already recorded count toward the 1,000 threshold. Forecaster 4 explicitly interprets the window as starting Feb 26 (the question opening date), requiring 1,000 deaths in just 64 days. Forecaster 5 appears to use the Jan 1 start but is less confident. The resolution criteria text says "year-to-date sum of dead plus missing through the end of April 2026," but the fine print note says "Events before this date [Feb 26] do not count toward resolution." These two statements appear contradictory, and this ambiguity drives the massive spread. If Jan 1 counts, only ~394 more deaths are needed (very likely); if only Feb 26 onward counts, ~1,000 deaths are needed in 64 days (much harder).

**Disagreement 2: What is the appropriate base rate?**
Forecasters use wildly different base rates: forecaster 1 uses 93%, forecaster 2 uses 18%, forecaster 3 uses 88%, forecaster 4 uses 7%, and forecaster 5 uses 24%. These differences stem partly from Disagreement 1 (different counting windows produce different historical reference classes) and partly from different methodological choices about which historical years are analogous.

**Disagreement 3: How much weight to give the January storm anomaly?**
Forecasters 1, 2, 3 treat the high January death rate as likely to persist or even accelerate in spring. Forecasters 4 and 5 argue that Cyclone Harry was an anomalous weather event that inflated January numbers, and that the daily death rate will revert significantly in March-April.

Root Causes:

1. **Resolution criteria interpretation** (Disagreement 1): This is a **different interpretation of the resolution criteria**, specifically the tension between "year-to-date sum" and the note that "Events before [Feb 26] do not count." This is the dominant driver of the spread and is potentially resolvable by careful re-reading of the criteria or finding precedent.

2. **Base rate assumptions** (Disagreement 2): Partly driven by Disagreement 1, partly by **different base rate assumptions** about which historical years to include and how to construct the reference class.

3. **Storm anomaly weighting** (Disagreement 3): This is a **different weighting of the same evidence** — all forecasters acknowledge the storms but disagree on persistence. Partially resolvable by checking whether post-storm months in prior years showed reversion.

3. Please carefully read the resolution criteria for this question: "This question resolves to Yes if the IOM Missing Migrants Project incident dataset shows that the year-to-date sum of dead plus missing through the end of April 2026 for Mediterranean is at least 1,000." The note says "Events before [Feb 26] do not count toward resolution." Does "year-to-date sum" mean counting from January 1, 2026, or only from February 26, 2026?
