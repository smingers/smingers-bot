Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Critical): Resolution window - January 1 vs February 26**

This was the single most important disagreement, and the targeted research **decisively resolves it in favor of forecaster 4's interpretation** (Feb 26 onward only). The agent research found:

1. The IOM dashboard currently shows **183** Mediterranean deaths/missing YTD as of Feb 26, 2026 — NOT 606. This is a critical finding. The 606 figure reported by multiple news outlets appears to include estimates and unverified reports that IOM has not yet incorporated into its official dataset.

2. The agent's analysis of the resolution criteria concludes: "only deaths/missing from 26 Feb 2026 through 30 Apr 2026 count, so the resolver must adjust the calendar-year figure accordingly." The note "Events before this date do not count toward resolution" explicitly overrides the "year-to-date" language.

3. This means **zero** of the deaths recorded before Feb 26 count. The question requires 1,000 NEW deaths recorded between Feb 26 and April 30, 2026.

This completely undermines the reasoning of forecasters 1, 2, and 3, who assumed the ~606 deaths already counted toward the threshold.

**Disagreement 2: IOM dashboard figure vs news reports**

The agent found the IOM dashboard shows only **183** YTD as of Feb 26, while news sources cite ~606. This ~420 gap suggests either (a) significant reporting lag in the IOM dataset, (b) news sources include unverified/estimated deaths not yet in the official dataset, or (c) both. This is relevant because resolution depends on what the IOM dataset actually shows, not news estimates.

**Disagreement 3: Storm anomaly**

Less relevant now given the resolution window issue, but the research confirms January's toll was heavily storm-driven (Cyclone Harry), supporting forecasters 4 and 5's view that the pace would likely moderate.

Updated Analysis:

The resolution criteria require 1,000 deaths recorded in the IOM dataset for the Mediterranean from Feb 26 to April 30, 2026 — a 64-day window.

**Historical context for this window:**
- Full-year 2024 Mediterranean deaths: 2,452 → ~6.7/day average
- Full-year 2023: 3,155 → ~8.6/day
- Jan-Apr 2025: ~555 total for 4 months → ~4.6/day
- The deadliest full years (2015-2016) averaged ~10-14/day

To reach 1,000 in 64 days requires ~15.6 deaths/day — a rate that has essentially never been sustained for two consecutive months in the Mediterranean, even in the deadliest years. Even 2016 (the deadliest year with 5,136 deaths) averaged only ~14/day for the full year, and that included the peak summer months.

**Additional complication:** The IOM dashboard shows only 183 YTD vs. 606 reported in news. This suggests significant recording lag. Even if the true death rate is high, the IOM dataset may not reflect it promptly enough for the May 1 resolution check.

**For the question to resolve Yes:**
- Need ~15.6 deaths/day recorded in the IOM dataset for 64 consecutive days
- This would be unprecedented for a Feb-Apr period
- Even with 2026's elevated death rate, the Feb-Apr period historically has lower crossing volumes than summer
- The IOM dataset appears to significantly lag real-time reports

**Scenarios for Yes:**
- Multiple mass casualty events (200+ deaths each) plus elevated baseline — possible but unlikely
- A mega-wreck comparable to April 2015 (~750 deaths) would help but alone wouldn't suffice

I estimate the probability at approximately 5-10%. The required daily rate is roughly double what even the deadliest years have sustained during this period, and the IOM recording lag adds further difficulty.

However, I note some uncertainty: the 183 figure on the dashboard vs. 606 in news reports is puzzling. If the dashboard rapidly catches up and the true rate is closer to what news reports suggest (~11/day recently), and if the question resolver interprets "year-to-date" literally despite the note, the probability would be much higher. But taking the resolution criteria at face value with the Feb 26 cutoff, this is very unlikely.

Confidence: MEDIUM

The research clearly resolves the resolution window question (favoring the Feb 26 start), but there's residual uncertainty about: (1) whether the question resolver will actually apply the Feb 26 cutoff strictly given the somewhat contradictory language, and (2) the large discrepancy between the IOM dashboard (183) and news reports (606) creates uncertainty about what the dataset will actually show.

Given this uncertainty — particularly that the resolution criteria text says "year-to-date sum" which naturally means Jan 1, while the note says events before Feb 26 don't count — I'll weight both interpretations. If Jan 1 interpretation (~70% likely to be the intended reading given the main criteria text): ~93% probability. If Feb 26 interpretation (~30% likely): ~8% probability.

Weighted: 0.70 × 93% + 0.30 × 8% = 65.1% + 2.4% = 67.5%

Actually, re-reading more carefully: the resolution criteria explicitly say "year-to-date sum of dead plus missing through the end of April 2026." The term "year-to-date" unambiguously means from January 1. The note about "Events before this date do not count" is a standard boilerplate note on many forecasting questions that typically refers to the resolution *trigger* — i.e., the question doesn't resolve early based on pre-opening events. But the resolution check happens on May 1 and looks at the YTD figure. I think the most natural reading is that the YTD (Jan 1 - Apr 30) figure is what matters, and the note is standard boilerplate. This favors forecasters 1-3.

But the dashboard showing 183 vs 606 is concerning. If the IOM dataset only shows 183 as of Feb 26, there may be significant lag, and the final Apr 30 figure could be lower than expected.

Balancing all this: the YTD interpretation likely applies (Jan 1), ~606 deaths have occurred but only ~183 are in the dataset so far. With recording lag, the dataset may eventually catch up. The question is what the dataset shows as of May 1 for the Jan-Apr period. Given historical lag patterns, most incidents do get recorded eventually, but there could be a 2-4 week lag.

I'll set my probability at 75%, reflecting high likelihood under the Jan 1 interpretation but discounted for the significant IOM recording lag evident from the 183 vs 606 discrepancy.

Probability: 75%
