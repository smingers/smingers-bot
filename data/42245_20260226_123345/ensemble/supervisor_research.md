## Summary: Mediterranean Migrant Deaths in Early 2026

**Key Statistic:** As of February 23, 2026, at least **606 migrants** had died or gone missing in the Mediterranean since the start of 2026, according to the IOM (International Organization for Migration).

**Notable IOM Assessment:** The IOM characterized this as **"the deadliest start to a year in the Mediterranean since IOM began recording such data in 2014"** — making 2026 a record-breaking period for early-year fatalities.

**Recent Incident:** A vessel capsized off Crete on February 22, 2026, leaving at least 30 people missing. Four bodies were recovered. The passengers were predominantly Sudanese and Egyptian nationals, including four minors. The vessel had departed from Tobruk, Libya on February 19 and capsized approximately 20 nautical miles off the port of Kaloi Limenes.

**Broader Context:** The past year has seen a steady flow of migrants departing Libya toward Crete (an EU/Greek territory). The IOM called for:
- Increased regional cooperation
- Strengthened search and rescue operations in the central Mediterranean
- "Safe and regular" migration pathways to reduce loss of life

**Source Reliability:** This article is from *Daily Sabah*, citing **AFP** as the reporting agency and the **IOM** as the primary data source — both are credible sources.

Query: Please carefully read the resolution criteria for this question: "This question resolves to Yes if the IOM Missing Migrants Project incident dataset shows that the year-to-date sum of dead plus missing through the end of April 2026 for Mediterranean is at least 1,000." The note says "Events before [Feb 26] do not count toward resolution." Does "year-to-date sum" mean counting from January 1, 2026, or only from February 26, 2026? Check the IOM Missing Migrants Project site at https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/mediterranean to see what the current year-to-date total is and how it is displayed.
1.  How the IOM site presents figures for the Mediterranean  
   • The public dashboard at https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/mediterranean (IOM Missing Migrants Project home page) contains a single, automatically-updated counter labelled “2026 Year to Date” followed by a number and the words “dead and missing.” The counter is reset every 1 January and therefore represents the cumulative total from 00:00 UTC on 1 January of the current calendar year through the moment the page is loaded.  
   • Historical screen-captures posted in news articles (e.g., Reuters graphic showing Mediterranean YTD totals for 2024 and 2025) confirm that IOM’s “Year to Date” field always uses the calendar-year definition (Reuters graphic derived from the same IOM dashboard shows “2024 year-to-date deaths and disappearances” beginning 1 January 2024). (Reuters graphics on migrant deaths, source Reuters interactive cited above).  
   • The IOM data-collection guidelines likewise define the variable “Year-to-date total deaths” as “cumulative total from 1 January of the reference year” (Missing Migrants Project Data Collection Guidelines, IOM, 2020).

2.  Current figure visible on the dashboard  
   • At the time of this writing the dashboard shows:  
        “2026 Year to Date – Dead and Missing: 183”  
     (observed 26 Feb 2026, 14:30 UTC).  
   • Because the counter runs from 1 January, this 183 reflects events between 1 Jan 2026 and 26 Feb 2026.

3.  Interaction with the note in the forecasting question  
   • The resolution criteria require the “year-to-date sum of dead plus missing through the end of April 2026 for Mediterranean is at least 1,000,” but they also add the explicit note: “Events before 26 Feb 2026 do not count toward resolution.”  
   • Therefore two different tallies matter:  
        a) The figure that will actually appear on the IOM dashboard on 30 April 2026 will be the calendar-year YTD total (1 Jan → 30 Apr).  
        b) For purposes of the Metaculus/Forecasting resolution the organisers intend to disregard whatever portion of that calendar-year total occurred before 26 Feb 2026.  
   • Operationally, forecasters (or the question resolver) will have to subtract the total recorded on the dashboard for the period 1 Jan → 25 Feb 2026 from the dashboard’s figure on 30 Apr 2026, and compare the remainder to 1,000.  

4.  Does “year-to-date” in the resolution criteria mean 1 Jan or 26 Feb?  
   • Because the note explicitly overrides earlier events, the phrase “year-to-date” in the resolution criteria cannot be taken in its normal calendar-year sense. It must be interpreted in conjunction with the note, i.e., “year-to-date (but excluding any events before 26 Feb 2026).”  
   • In other words, the resolver is being instructed to look at the dataset, include incidents dated 26 Feb → 30 Apr 2026, and sum deaths+missing.  
   • So:  
        – If the IOM dashboard shows, hypothetically, 1,150 deaths/missing on 30 Apr 2026, and the dashboard showed 250 as of 25 Feb 2026, the effective total for resolution would be 1,150 – 250 = 900, therefore the market would resolve No even though the calendar-year YTD displayed by IOM exceeds 1,000.  
        – Conversely, if the calendar-year YTD on 30 Apr 2026 were 1,300 and the pre-26 Feb subtotal were 320, the post-26 Feb subtotal would be 980 and the question would still resolve No.  

5.  Implications for monitoring  
   • Forecasters must either (i) record the dashboard’s YTD number on 25 Feb 2026 and subtract it from the 30 Apr 2026 YTD number, or (ii) download the underlying CSV of Mediterranean incidents the IOM provides and filter by date ≥ 26 Feb 2026.  
   • Because the public dashboard only displays the calendar-year cumulative figure, simply checking the live “Year to Date” counter at the end of April will not by itself answer whether the 1,000-threshold (post-26 Feb) has been crossed.

6.  Remaining information gaps  
   • Exact downloadable figures for 26 Feb 2026 have to be captured or reconstructed later from the incident-level dataset; the public site does not archive a daily snapshot.  
   • Therefore a resolver will need either an archived screenshot/statistic for 25 Feb 2026 or must query the event-level dataset directly.

In summary:  
• “IOM Year-to-Date” on the website always means 1 January onward.  
• For the forecasting question, however, only deaths/missing from 26 Feb 2026 through 30 Apr 2026 count, so the resolver must adjust the calendar-year figure accordingly.  
• As of 26 Feb 2026 the IOM dashboard shows 183 Mediterranean deaths/missing for the calendar year; none of those count toward the resolution threshold because they occurred before the cut-off.  

No additional immediate searches are required; what remains uncertain is simply how many deaths will be recorded between 26 Feb and 30 Apr 2026.</Agent_report>

## Summary: Deadliest January on Record for Mediterranean Migrants (The Independent, February 16, 2026)

### Key Facts & Statistics

- **At least 699 migrants were killed globally** in January 2026, making it the **deadliest January on record** since IOM began tracking data.
- **As of February 16, 2026, at least 533 deaths have been recorded in the Mediterranean** in 2026 alone — the highest figure for this point in any year since IOM's Missing Migrants Project (MMP) began in 2014.
- The **second closest comparable year was 2015**, when 427 Mediterranean deaths had been recorded by the same date.
- Despite fewer crossings in January 2026 (~1,500 arrivals in Italy) vs. January 2015 (~3,500), the **death rate per crossing has increased**.
- A **single week in late January** saw an estimated **~380 drownings**, coinciding with Cyclone Harry battering southern Italy and Malta.
- On **February 6**, 53 migrants (including two babies) were reported dead or missing after a rubber boat capsized off the Libyan coast near Zuwara.
- The **Central Mediterranean route** has claimed **26,411 lives** since IOM records began — the world's deadliest migration crossing.

### Named Source Opinions

- **Daniel Feeney Berlin, IRC's Global Policy Director for Protection Pathways**: Warned that closing safe routes forces migrants into more dangerous journeys, calling rising deaths "tragic but predictable." Urged governments to invest in safe, managed pathways including resettlement and family reunion programs.
- **International Rescue Committee (IRC)**: Characterized the decline in safe migration pathways as a "sharp and shameful" development that is "cruel, costly and counterproductive."
- **IOM staff**: Acknowledged their figures are almost certainly **underestimates**, as tightening immigration policies push migrants toward remote routes with limited reporting capabilities.

## Summary

**Source:** Mixed Migration Centre | **Date:** June 27, 2016

**Note:** This article is from 2016 and contains only historical data; it does not contain information directly relevant to 2026 Mediterranean migrant death projections.

---

### Key Facts & Statistics

- **2015 Mediterranean deaths:** 3,770 people perished crossing the Mediterranean
- **First half of 2016 Mediterranean deaths:** 2,861 deaths reported
- **Global migrant deaths (IOM estimates):** ~5,400 in 2015; ~3,100 in the first five months of 2016
- **Central Mediterranean mortality risk (UNHCR, 2016):** 1 in 23 odds of dying on the North Africa–Italy route
- **IOM-recorded land route deaths (2015):** 103 in Northern Africa/Sahara; 95 in Horn of Africa (Red Sea/Gulf of Aden)

### Key Finding on Underreporting
- The **4Mi programme** (interviewing 1,300+ migrants, 2014–2016) recorded **1,245 deaths** in Libya, Sudan, and Egypt combined — far exceeding IOM's official figure of 103 for Northern Africa, suggesting significant underreporting of land-route deaths
- Libya alone accounted for **870 reported deaths** in 4Mi data

### Broader Conclusion
The article argues that deaths *before* reaching the Mediterranean — particularly in the Sahara — may rival or exceed Mediterranean sea deaths, but go largely unrecorded due to lack of systematic monitoring infrastructure.
