Analysis:
The key to answering the forecast is knowing (1) how many Mediterranean migrant deaths and disappearances the IOM Missing Migrants Project has already logged for 2026 (Jan-Feb data now available) and (2) whether recent large-scale shipwrecks or surges in crossings suggest the tally could pass 1,000 before 1 May.  Therefore, the most relevant articles will:
• cite the latest IOM/UNHCR figures for 2026 year-to-date deaths or missing persons in the Mediterranean;
• describe individual incidents in Jan-Feb 2026 that added dozens or hundreds to the count;
• discuss seasonal patterns (e.g., spring uptick) and policy or weather factors that could affect volume in March–April 2026.
