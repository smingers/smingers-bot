Analysis:
To gauge whether Mediterranean migrant deaths will reach 1,000 before May 2026, the best outside view is the year-to-date (Jan-Apr) death/missing counts reported by the IOM Missing Migrants Project in previous years. Key context includes:
• How many deaths were recorded by the end of April in each of the last 5–10 years.  
• In which years the 1,000 threshold was crossed by April (if ever).  
• Early 2026 tallies and recent press coverage on winter-spring crossings and shipwrecks.  
These data will reveal typical seasonal patterns and any upward or downward trends, informing the probability for 2026.
