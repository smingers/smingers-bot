The bodies are believed to be victims of shipwrecks during the storm, part of a broader pattern: according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 606 people have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean since the start of 2026\u2014marking the deadliest beginning to a year since IOM began tracking data in 2014. On the central Mediterranean route alone, 501 deaths or disappearances were recorded by February 21, 2026. Among the most recent incidents, at least 30 people died or went missing after a vessel departing from Tobruk, Libya, capsized off Crete during the storm. Despite the Italian government claiming a significant reduction in arrivals\u201466,296 in 2025, roughly half the 2023 figure\u2014due to containment policies including agreements with Libya and Tunisia and naval blockades, the number of deaths has risen. The IOM reports over 2,100 migrant deaths or disappearances in 2025 alone. In Libya, the Red Crescent recovered seven bodies, including three children, near Qasr al-Akhyar. The collective Refugees in Libya estimates around 1,000 people are missing after the cyclone, based on family reports. Relatives like Semeka, stranded in Sfax since 2023, are demanding identification of the bodies found along Italian shores, seeking names, truth, and dignity. The paradox remains: fewer arrivals, more deaths. The Mediterranean has not become less traversed\u2014it has become more deadly. Each unnamed body recovered underscores a central question: what does 'border control' truly mean if the border continues to return only corpses?\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 06:17 AM\nSource:[TP24.it](https://www.tp24.it/2026/02/26/cronaca/meno-sbarchi-piu-morti-la-strage-invisibile-dopo-il-ciclone-harry/230226)\n\n**Three Years After Cutro Shipwreck, Calls for Safe Migration Routes Grow Louder**\nOn the third anniversary of the Cutro shipwreck on February 25\u201326, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of at least 94 migrants\u2014mostly from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, and Iran\u2014OIM and UNHCR renewed calls for urgent action on safe migration routes. Six Italian officials, including two from the Coast Guard and four from the Financial Guard, are on trial for negligence, multiple counts of manslaughter, and failure to act despite knowing about the overcrowded vessel the night before the disaster. Prosecution evidence revealed that the Financial Guard had been aware of the boat since the previous evening but did not intervene. Over 50 survivors and family members of victims have joined as civil parties, rejecting the notion that the tragedy was a 'fate' and asserting it was due to systemic failures. The trial will determine personal accountability within the command chain. Meanwhile, the Mediterranean remains the world\u2019s deadliest migration route: in 2025, at least 1,330 people died, with many more unrecorded. By February 24, 2026, 503 deaths had already been confirmed in the Central Mediterranean\u2014over a third of the total from the entire previous year\u2014amid ongoing discoveries of bodies on Italian shores and a recent reported shipwreck off Tobruk, Libya, killing at least 30. The deaths are attributed to criminal smuggling networks exploiting vulnerable migrants and a lack of safe, legal entry channels. Salvatore Sortino of OIM emphasized that maritime rescue is a legal obligation and must remain a priority, requiring stronger search-and-rescue systems, crackdowns on traffickers, and expanded legal migration pathways. Chiara Cardoletti of UNHCR stressed that no single state can address this crisis alone, advocating for a coordinated multilateral approach involving countries of origin, transit, and destination to ensure protection, prevent abuse, and share responsibility.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 07:09 PM\nSource:[La Repubblica.it](https://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2026/02/25/news/naufragio_di_cutro_dopo_3_anni_si_parla_ancora_di_urgenza_per_canali_sicuri_d_ingresso-425183733/)\n\n**Emergency: Cutro Shipwreck Was Not a Tragedy but a Result of Grave Negligence**\nEmergency stated that the 2023 maritime disaster off Steccato di Cutro, which resulted in 94 confirmed deaths and numerous missing persons, was not a tragic accident but the consequence of serious negligence. The organization emphasized that no search and rescue plan was activated that night, and the case of the vessel 'Summer Love' was treated as a border security operation rather than a humanitarian emergency. Emergency has joined the ongoing trial at the Crotone Tribunal, where four Financial Guard and two Coast Guard military personnel are charged with multiple negligent homicides and negligent shipwreck. The association, along with other NGOs, has intervened as a civil party to support survivors and families in their pursuit of justice and to uphold international legal obligations to prevent future tragedies. Emergency called for a reevaluation of migration policies in Italy and Europe, criticizing current approaches that prioritize border defense over fundamental rights, particularly the right to life. The organization warns that recent developments\u2014including the European Migration and Asylum Pact effective June 2026 and the 'naval blockade' provision in the February 11, 2026, Immigration Bill\u2014risk worsening conditions at sea. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 503 deaths were recorded in the Central Mediterranean route in 2026, a figure likely underreported as it does not include approximately 1,000 missing persons reported by Refugees in Libya. This number marks a sharp increase compared to 1,330 fatalities recorded in 2025. Emergency concluded by demanding a European search and rescue mission, expansion of legal and safe migration pathways into Europe, and an end to agreements with third countries like Libya and Tunisia that violate human rights.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 04:14 PM\nSource:[Bresciaoggi.it](https://www.bresciaoggi.it/news/italia/emergency-naufragio-cutro-non-fu-fatalit%C3%A0-ma-frutto-gravi-negligenze-1.12939555)\n\n**Three Years After Cutro Tragedy, Emergency Demands Justice and Migration Reform**\nThree years after the February 26, 2023, shipwreck off the coast of Steccato di Cutro, which resulted in 94 confirmed deaths and numerous missing persons on the vessel 'Summer Love,' the humanitarian organization Emergency has renewed its call for truth and reform in migration policies. According to Emergency, the tragedy was not a 'fate' but the result of serious negligence, as no search and rescue operation was activated that night and the incident was treated as a border security operation. The organization emphasizes the need for a European search and rescue mission, expansion of legal and safe migration routes to Europe, and the termination of agreements with countries like Libya and Tunisia, which it claims do not uphold human rights. A criminal trial is ongoing at the Crotone Tribunal, with four members of the Guardia di Finanza and two from the Guardia Costiera charged with multiple negligent homicide and negligent shipwreck. Emergency has joined as a civil party alongside other humanitarian groups, aiming to support survivors and families in seeking justice and to uphold international legal obligations to prevent future tragedies. The organization also criticizes current Italian and European migration policies, which it argues prioritize border protection over fundamental rights, citing practices such as assigning distant ports to humanitarian vessels, restricting multiple rescues, harsh penalties against NGOs, collaboration with human rights-abusing countries, and the externalization of borders. Emergency warns that new measures, including the European Migration and Asylum Pact and a February 11, 2026, government-approved immigration bill, may worsen conditions in the Central Mediterranean. Since the beginning of 2026, 503 migrant deaths have been recorded in the Central Mediterranean by the International Organization for Migration\u2014though Emergency notes this is a significant undercount, as nearly 1,000 missing persons have been reported by Refugees in Libya. In 2025, 1,330 deaths were recorded. These figures, three years after the Cutro disaster, have reignited debate over responsibility, maritime rescues, and Mediterranean migration management.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 03:34 PM\nSource:[Il Crotonese](https://www.ilcrotonese.it/2026/02/25/tre-anni-da-cutro-emergency-non-fu-una-fatalita/1725715/)\n\n**Shipwreck off the coast of Greece: Four dead recovered, dozens missing**\nFour bodies have been recovered from the shipwreck of a wooden boat that sank on February 22, 2026, off the coast of Crete, Greece, with approximately 50 migrants on board. The recovered victims include three Egyptian men and one 28-year-old Sudanese woman, according to the Greek authorities and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which confirmed the latest count. Eighteen Egyptian nationals remain missing, along with individuals of other nationalities. The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led by Minister Badr Abdelatty, has instructed the Egyptian embassy in Athens to intensify coordination with Greek authorities to monitor the search for missing persons and expedite the repatriation of the victims' remains to Egypt. The vessel, which departed from Tobruk, Libya, on February 19, capsized during a rescue operation in rough seas near Kaloi Limenes, southern Crete, on Saturday. Twenty people were rescued\u201416 men and four minors. Crete has become a major migration transit point from Libya to the European Union. According to the UNHCR, over 16,770 asylum seekers arrived on the island in 2025, more than any other island in the Aegean Sea. In the previous year, more than 17,000 Egyptians reached Europe via the Mediterranean, making them the largest group of irregular African migrants to the continent.

The victims are believed to be North African migrants who attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea in January, likely perishing during Storm Harry. Tens of thousands of migrant boats departed from Tunisia and Algeria during the storm, with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reporting over 450 migrant deaths in total. The Bishop of Palermo, Corrado Lorefice, condemned the inhumane immigration policies of the Italian government under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and the European Union, calling the tragedy a consequence of these policies. Meloni\u2019s government recently announced stricter migration measures, including easier deportation of undocumented migrants, an expanded list of 'safe countries,' preventive police actions, and plans for a sea blockade to prevent migrant boats from reaching Italy. These measures appear effective: arrivals in southern Italian ports dropped from over 157,000 in 2023 to 66,000 in 2024.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 12:28 PM\nSource:[Het Nieuwsblad](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/buitenland/minstens-15-lijken-aangespoeld-in-enkele-weken-tijd-in-italie/137104482.html)\n\n**Record Number of Migrants Die in Mediterranean Crossing to Europe**\nThe number of migrants who died during sea crossings to Europe has reached a record high, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

The vessel, which departed from Tobruk, Libya, on February 19, capsized 20 nautical miles south of Kali Limenes due to severe weather. Of the 20 people rescued, four were minors; three men and one woman were confirmed dead. Additionally, 15 bodies were washed ashore along Italian coasts in recent days, likely having died during hazardous crossings from North Africa in January 2026. The deceased included a man with an orange life vest found near Tropea in Calabria, as reported by the Sardinian newspaper 'L'Unione Sarda'.

The vessel, which departed from Tobruk, Libya, on February 19, sank approximately 20 nautical miles south of the Greek island of Crete. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that 20 people were rescued, including four minors. As of Monday, authorities had recovered the bodies of three men and one woman. Since the beginning of 2026, at least 606 migrants have been recorded as dead or missing along the Central Mediterranean route, marking the deadliest start of the year on record since data collection began in 2014. The IOM expressed deep concern over the loss of life and called for stronger regional cooperation to enhance search and rescue operations and ensure safe disembarkation. The organization warned that trafficking and smuggling networks continue to exploit migrants along the route, using unsafe vessels and exposing individuals to severe abuse and lack of protection. The IOM emphasized that stronger international cooperation and protection-centered responses are essential to dismantle criminal networks and expand safe, regular migration pathways.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 05:27 AM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/pt/story/2026/02/1852474)\n\n**Deadly Routes: 606 Dead or Missing on the Mediterranean Since Start of 2026**\nSince the beginning of 2026, 606 people have died or are missing after attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which described this as the 'deadliest start to a year' in a decade. The likelihood of finding missing individuals at sea is nearly zero. Between 2014 and 2019, approximately 17,900 people drowned in the Mediterranean, with around 12,000 never recovered. A boat carrying about 50 passengers from Tobruk, Libya, capsized near Greece due to a severe storm; 20 were rescued, while 30 are presumed dead or missing. In southern Italy, at least 15 bodies washed ashore in Sicily and Calabria, including a man with an orange life jacket near Tropea and a woman in the same region, with additional corpses found on Pantelleria. The IOM reported that nearly one-third of all deaths and missing persons for 2025 had already occurred in the first two months of 2026. Bishops from Calabria and Sicily strongly criticized Italy\u2019s migration policy, calling it 'inhuman' and stating that 'silence is complicity.' This criticism followed Italy\u2019s adoption of a new law allowing sea blockades during 'exceptional pressure' to prevent migrant boats from landing, enabling the transfer of migrants to planned deportation centers in Albania. The law was passed after EU pressure from countries like Italy. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stated her government would use all available tools to 'ensure border security.' The EU is further tightening its already restrictive migration policy to deter crossings. Italy\u2019s 2023 agreements with Libya and Tunisia temporarily reduced arrivals, but numbers have since surged. In 2023, 20,381 people attempted the crossing with 318 deaths or missing. In 2026, only 6,710 attempted the journey, yet 606 are dead or missing\u2014nearly 9%\u2014indicating that stricter policies have led to more dangerous routes and higher fatalities, rather than reducing migration attempts.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 05:09 AM\nSource:[watson.ch/](https://www.watson.ch/!439113385)\n\n**'Pay or he dies,' families told as more Egyptians risk Mediterranean crossing**\nIn February 2026, AFP reported on the escalating risks faced by Egyptian migrants attempting the Mediterranean crossing, driven by economic collapse and despair. The article details the story of 18-year-old Hamdy Ibrahim, who vanished after leaving Egypt\u2019s Nile Delta in November 2023, with his family receiving extortion calls from smugglers in Libya demanding 190,000 Egyptian pounds ($4,000) or face death. His brother Youssef said the threat was clear: 'Handle it like the other families do. Otherwise he'll be thrown into the sea.' Similar threats were reported by 55-year-old Abed Gouda, whose brother Mohamed was among 18 young men who perished when their boat sank near Crete. Seventeen died and 15 remain missing, including Hamdy and Mohamed. More than 17,000 Egyptians reached Europe via the Mediterranean in 2024, while 1,328 people of all nationalities died or disappeared on the route, according to Frontex and the UN. The crisis is fueled by the Egyptian pound losing over two-thirds of its value since 2022, bread prices tripling, and fuel costs rising fourfold. In villages like Kafr Abdallah Aziza, infrastructure is deteriorating\u2014cracked irrigation canals, potholed roads, and half-built homes reflect widespread poverty. Pharmacist Refaat Abdelsamad said 'half of our young people are now considering illegal migration.' Despite the dangers, many believe they have no choice. Nour Khalil of the Egypt Refugees Platform described the Libya route as 'more dangerous,' with smugglers using 'well-established networks' that charge high fees and subject migrants to torture, rape, and forced labor. The EU signed a 7.4-billion-euro economic development deal with Cairo in 2024 to curb irregular migration, but Timothy Kaldas of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy argued that border controls fail to address the root cause: 'People need to feel secure in their homes.' In Kafr Moustafa Effendi, families still mourn the 2023 capsizing of a rusted fishing boat carrying 750 migrants, one of the deadliest Mediterranean shipwrecks. Despite the trauma, some survivors like construction worker Hassan Darwish, now in Rome earning $700 monthly, said they 'would do it again' because they can now support their families\u2014a feat impossible in Egypt.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 01:04 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/98RQ6CQ)\n\n**Over 600 Migrants Died or Disappeared in the Mediterranean in 2026, UN Agency Reports**\nAt least 606 migrants died or went missing in the Mediterranean Sea in 2026, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), reporting on February 23, 2026. In January alone, 459 deaths or disappearances were recorded\u2014the highest number for the month since records began in 2014. The most recent shipwreck occurred on Saturday, February 21, near the Greek island of Crete, where at least 30 migrants are believed to have died or disappeared after their vessel capsized due to bad weather. Greek authorities recovered four bodies\u2014three men and one woman\u2014by February 23, with ongoing search operations using four patrol boats. On the same day, 20 migrants, mostly Sudanese and Egyptian, were rescued by a merchant ship dispatched by the Greek Search and Rescue Center. The vessel had departed from Tobruk, Libya, on February 19 and sank about 20 nautical miles (approximately 37 kilometers) south of Kaloi Limenes. Earlier, on January 26, two one-year-old twins died of hypothermia just before landing in Lampedusa, Italy. In total, eight children have died in the Mediterranean in 2026, according to IOM data. The Mediterranean routes are the primary and deadliest pathways for irregular migration into Europe, with 34,000 people missing since 2014, most along the Central Mediterranean route from Libya and Tunisia to Italy and Malta.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 09:13 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2026/02/mais-de-600-migrantes-morreram-ou-desapareceram-no-mediterraneo-em-2026-diz-agencia-da-onu.shtml)\n\n**UN: Over 600 Dead or Missing in Mediterranean Migrant Shipwrecks Since January 2026**\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that at least 606 people have died or gone missing in Mediterranean migrant boat accidents since the beginning of 2026, marking the deadliest start to a year in the region since records began in 2014.

The boat, which departed from the Libyan port of Tobrouk on Thursday, sank on Saturday in difficult weather conditions about 20 nautical miles south of Kali Limenes, Crete. Four bodies\u2014three men and one woman\u2014were recovered, and 20 survivors, including four minors, were rescued. The IOM warns that at least 30 more passengers may have died or gone missing. This tragedy contributes to a grim statistic: 606 migrants have died or gone missing in just two months, making 2026 already the deadliest year in the Mediterranean since the IOM launched its 'Missing Migrants' project in 2014. In the central Mediterranean, the Ocean Viking, operated by SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e France, conducted two separate rescue operations. First, 97 people\u201414 of them minors\u2014were rescued from a wooden boat that had left Zouara, Libya, two days earlier. The operation occurred in the joint search and rescue zone of Tunisia and Malta. Two survivors required urgent medical care due to dehydration. While en route to Livorno, Italy, the Ocean Viking was diverted for a second rescue after a distress signal was detected by the Albatross UNO surveillance aircraft, jointly operated with HPISwiss. This second operation saved 50 additional people, bringing the total rescued to 147. All 147 survivors are now safe and sailing toward Italy, more than three days away at sea. Both organizations urge better coordination: the IOM calls for intensified search and rescue efforts and stronger regional cooperation, while SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e emphasizes the need for rapid identification of distressed vessels and sustained NGO presence at sea. These operations coincide with the European Union\u2019s approval of new asylum rules on February 23, 2026, establishing a European list of 'safe countries of origin'\u2014including Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Kosovo, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014and introducing the concept of 'safe third countries' to allow member states to reject asylum claims under certain conditions.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 07:46 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/fr/monde/m%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e-plus-de-30-migrants-port%C3%A9s-disparus-au-large-de-la-gr%C3%A8ce-147-secourus-au-sud-de-malte-en-quelques-jours/3838206)\n\n**Over 600 Migrants Dead or Missing in Mediterranean Since January 2026**\nMore than 600 migrants have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean since January 2026, marking the deadliest start to a year since the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM) began collecting data in 2014. According to the IOM, the number of fatalities in the first two months of 2026 already exceeds previous records for the same period. At least 30 migrants are believed to have died or disappeared in a shipwreck off the southern coast of the Greek island of Crete on Saturday. Authorities recovered the bodies of three men and one woman, while 20 survivors\u2014including four minors\u2014were rescued by a Panamanian-flagged merchant vessel.

The incident occurred north of Zuwara on Friday, January 31, 2026, after the vessel, which departed from Zawiya at approximately 11 p.m. Thursday, began taking on water six hours into the journey. The IOM reported that two Nigerian women were rescued, one of whom said her husband drowned and the other that both her babies died. The boat was carrying migrants and refugees from several African countries, likely en route to Lampedusa, Italy\u2014about 350 km away\u2014though the final destination remains unknown. The IOM emphasized that such open rubber dinghies are unsuitable for long sea crossings, especially in harsh winter conditions. At least 375 people have died or gone missing in the central Mediterranean in January 2026 alone, with many more tragedies likely unrecorded. The IOM reiterated that Libya is not a safe port for migrants, citing ongoing reports of mass graves, illegal detention sites, and torture for ransom. In Ajdabiya, a raid uncovered an illegal detention site, and in Kufra, authorities discovered an underground facility housing 221 migrants, including women and children, in grossly inhumane conditions. The IOM continues to support voluntary repatriation flights\u2014such as for Pakistani and Nigerian nationals\u2014and advocates for greater international cooperation, safer legal migration routes, and dismantling trafficking networks.

One woman reported losing her two children in the sinking, while the other said she lost her husband. According to their testimonies, the inflatable boat departed from Al-Zawiya, Libya, around 11:00 PM on February 5 and sank six hours later. IOM data show that at least 375 migrants were reported dead or missing in January alone due to multiple 'invisible' shipwrecks in the Central Mediterranean under extreme weather conditions, with hundreds of additional deaths likely unrecorded.

The organization expressed 'grave concern' over reports of several boat accidents, citing severe weather conditions that severely hampered search and rescue operations. According to IOM spokesperson Jorge Galindo, three boat incidents were reported in the past ten days\u2014two on January 23 and one on January 25\u2014resulting in the presumed deaths of 104 people. The IOM estimates that nine boats, primarily departing from Tunisia and Libya, sank between January 14 and 21, with approximately 380 people missing. Merna Abdel Azim, a data analyst with the IOM\u2019s 'Missing Migrants Project,' confirmed that only three fatalities from the January 23 incident have been verified. Among the victims were twin infants, aged one, who died of hypothermia before reaching Lampedusa, Italy, and a man who died upon arrival under the same cause. The mother, a woman from Guinea, had boarded the boat in Sfax, Tunisia. The IOM warned that the final death toll could be significantly higher, underscoring that the central Mediterranean remains the world\u2019s deadliest migration route. One additional boat, carrying at least 51 people, departed from the same location but never reached its destination and is believed to have sunk near Tobruk, Libya. Another boat with at least 51 people sank, with only one survivor. The IOM condemned the smuggling of migrants on unsafe, overcrowded vessels as criminal, emphasizing that organizing departures during severe storms constitutes a particularly heinous act, deliberately placing lives at near-certain risk. The organization reiterated that the central Mediterranean is the world\u2019s most dangerous migration route, with 1,340 deaths recorded in 2025.

This figure already approaches the total annual fatalities for some previous years and underscores the extreme dangers facing migrants attempting crossings during winter and early spring months.\n\n## Major Shipwreck Incidents by Region\n\n### Greece (Crete and Aegean Sea)\nThe most recent major tragedy occurred on **February 22, 2026**, when a wooden boat carrying approximately 50 migrants capsized during a rescue operation about 20 nautical miles south of Kali Limenes, Crete [1][4][7]. The vessel had departed from Tobruk, Libya, on February 19. Four bodies were recovered (three Egyptian men and one 28-year-old Sudanese woman), while 20 people were rescued\u2014including four minors [1][10]. At least 30 migrants remain missing or feared dead from this incident alone [7][8][10].\n\nCrete has emerged as a critical transit point, with over 16,770 asylum seekers arriving on the island in 2025\u2014more than any other Aegean island [1].\n\n### Libya (Departure Point)\nLibyan ports, particularly Tobruk, have been the origin point for multiple deadly voyages. The February 22 Crete shipwreck originated from Tobruk [1][10], and earlier in January, at least 51 people were feared dead after a boat sank off Tobruk with only one survivor confirmed [12][15].\n\n### Tunisia (Departure Point)\nTunisia, specifically the port of Sfax, has been a major departure point for multiple tragedies. Between **January 14-21, 2026**, approximately **380 migrants went missing** from nine boats that departed from Tunisia and never arrived at their destinations [11][12][14][16]. Survivors reported that boats departed simultaneously from Sfax, with one reaching Lampedusa where three deaths were confirmed (twin girls aged approximately one year and one adult male, all dying of hypothermia), while another boat carrying at least 51 people never arrived [11][13][15].\n\n### Italy (Arrivals and Bodies Ashore)\nItalian coastlines have seen at least **15 bodies wash ashore** over a ten-day period in late February, believed to be North African migrants who perished during January crossings amid Storm Harry [3][4]. Bodies were found in multiple locations including Sicily, Pantelleria, Calabria (near Tropea), and Sardinia [4]. In Lampedusa, three deaths were confirmed in January from hypothermia [11][13][15].\n\n## Analysis of Risks for Early Spring Crossings\n\nThe data reveals several compounding risk factors that make early spring crossings particularly deadly:\n\n**1. Severe Weather Conditions**\nJanuary 2026 saw Cyclone/Storm Harry batter the Mediterranean, creating \"exceptionally violent\" conditions that severely hampered search and rescue operations [11][13][15]. Despite storm warnings, smugglers continued sending overcrowded, unseaworthy vessels to sea, resulting in mass casualties [12][13].\n\n**2. Trafficker Exploitation**\nThe IOM emphasizes that smuggling networks persistently exploit migrants by forcing them onto unsafe, overcrowded vessels, exposing them to \"severe abuse and extreme safety risks\" [5][8]. The organization condemned the criminal act of organizing departures during severe storms, deliberately placing lives at \"near-certain risk\" [12].\n\n**3. Hypothermia and Exposure**\nConfirmed deaths in Lampedusa included victims who died of hypothermia after rescue, highlighting the lethal combination of cold weather, inadequate clothing, and exposure to storm conditions [11][13][15].\n\n**4. Increased Flow on Libya-Crete Route**\nThe IOM identified a sharp increase in migration flows along the Libya-Crete route as a key factor in the 2026 fatality surge [2]. This route exposes migrants to extended periods in rough seas between North Africa and the Greek islands.\n\n**5. Reduced Search and Rescue Capacity**\nSevere winter weather reduces the effectiveness of rescue operations, while political constraints on NGO rescue vessels continue to limit maritime rescue capacity in international waters [19].\n\n## Historical Context and IOM Warnings\n\nThe 606 fatalities in just two months represent an unprecedented mortality rate. For context, the IOM's Missing Migrants Project recorded over 33,000 migrant deaths or disappearances in the Mediterranean since 2014, with 1,340 fatalities in 2025 alone [6][11][13].\n\nThe IOM has issued urgent calls for:\n- Intensified search and rescue operations in the Central Mediterranean [7][10]\n- Stronger regional cooperation and international action to dismantle smuggling networks [5][8]\n- Establishment of \"safe and regular migration routes\" to reduce reliance on dangerous sea crossings [6][7]\n- Protection-centered responses to combat criminal trafficking networks [10]\n\nThe Central Mediterranean remains the world's deadliest migration corridor, and with spring approaching, the combination of improved weather (encouraging more departures) and continued smuggler exploitation suggests the crisis may deepen without immediate international intervention [2][6].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
