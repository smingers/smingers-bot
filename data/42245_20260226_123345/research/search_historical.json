IOM recorded **73 people** from these \"invisible\" shipwrecks as missing and presumed dead.\n- **62 migrants** were rescued off Cape Greco, Cyprus (departed Lebanon on January 18); several children were in critical condition, with one death confirmed.\n- **Seven bodies** washed ashore in Antalya, T\u00fcrkiye, believed to belong to a group of **85 migrants** missing since departing Lebanon on December 11.\n\n### Named Source Opinions\n\n- **Amy Pope (IOM Director General):** Called the numbers \"a stark reminder\" that safe and regular migration pathways are the \"only solution\" benefiting both migrants and states.\n- **UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed:** Called for scaling up investment in Africa to meet SDGs and reforming international financial institutions to better represent African countries.\n\n### Context\nThe article was published in conjunction with a one-day summit in Rome hosted by Italy, focused on African development and migration management, attended by 20+ African and EU leaders and UN representatives.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://etias.com/articles/eu-migrant-crossings-drop,-med-route-still-hot\">\n## Summary: EU Migrant Crossings Drop, Med Route Still Hot (Etias)\n\n### Key Statistics\n\n- **Overall EU irregular crossings (Jan\u2013Apr 2025):** ~47,000 \u2014 down **27%** vs. same period in 2024\n- **Central Mediterranean crossings (Jan\u2013Apr 2025):** **15,718** \u2014 roughly flat compared to 2024; crossings rose ~40% in April due to improved weather\n- **Eastern Mediterranean crossings (Jan\u2013Apr 2025):** 12,200 \u2014 down 33% vs. 2024\n- **English Channel crossings (2025 to date):** 18,100 \u2014 up 5% vs. 2024\n- **Mediterranean deaths (Jan\u2013Apr 2025):** The IOM reported **555 deaths at sea** in the first four months of 2025\n- **Full-year 2024 Mediterranean deaths:** approximately **2,300**\n\n### Humanitarian Context\n- Despite lower overall crossing numbers, death risk persists; most fatalities occur on overloaded, unseaworthy vessels\n- Smuggling networks remain highly organized, charging migrants \u20ac9,500\u2013\u20ac13,000 per journey\n\n### Policy Developments\n- EU nations are expanding offshore \"return hubs\" (deportation centers outside EU jurisdiction), modeled partly on Italy's controversial Albania detention agreement\n- Critics, including Statewatch Director Chris Jones, warn these hubs circumvent legal oversight and human rights protections\n\n---\n**Relevance to forecast question:** The article explicitly states **555 Mediterranean deaths were recorded by IOM in the first four months of 2025**, providing a direct recent baseline for comparison with the 1,000-death threshold being tracked for the same period in 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164246\">\n## Summary: At Least Eight Drown in Red Sea as Smugglers Force Migrants Overboard\n\n**Source:** UN News | **Date:** June 11, 2025\n\n### Key Facts\n\n- On June 5, 2025, smugglers stopped a boat carrying ~150 passengers in the Red Sea near Djibouti, forcing migrants overboard; **at least 8 are confirmed dead, 22 missing**.\n- Five bodies were recovered near **Moulhoul\u00e9 in northern Djibouti**; the death toll was expected to rise.\n- IOM mobile patrols found many survivors in the desert; they are receiving medical care and psychosocial support at the IOM-run Migrant Response Center in Obock, Djibouti.\n\n### Mediterranean-Relevant Data Point\n- Separately, **10 migrant bodies washed ashore near Marsa Matrouh, Egypt**, believed to have departed from the Libyan coast \u2014 a common smuggling route across the Mediterranean to Europe.\n- IOM's Missing Migrants Project reports **more than 32,000 people have drowned in the Mediterranean since 2014**, with an unknown number still missing.\n\n### Eastern Route Context\n- **272 people confirmed dead** on the Eastern Mediterranean migrant route (including Djibouti-Yemen leg) so far in 2025.\n- Thousands of Horn of Africa migrants attempt the route to Gulf States via Yemen annually.\n\n### IOM Response\n- IOM called for stronger search and rescue operations and expanded safe migration pathways.\n\n---\n*Note: This article focuses primarily on the Red Sea/Djibouti incident;

H1 2025 data suggests the downward trend is continuing, though the Central Mediterranean route has started to increase again after dropping in 2024\n- **Central Mediterranean route** (North Africa to Italy) has been the busiest irregular route throughout the decade\n- **COVID-19** caused an overall drop in arrivals, followed by a rebound in 2021 and new highs in 2023 (first since 2016)\n\n**Mediterranean Deaths (IOM data cited in article):**\n- **2023:** 3,155 deaths recorded \u2014 highest since 2017\n- **2024:** 2,573 deaths \u2014 a decrease in absolute numbers, but the **death rate increased** according to IOM\n- The Mediterranean is described as **\"the deadliest migration route in the world\"**\n- Deaths on routes through Europe and from West Africa to the Canary Islands reached **record numbers in 2024**\n\n**Asylum Trends:**\n- Syrians historically received ~90% positive asylum decisions; most EU countries paused Syrian applications in late 2024\n- Overall EU positive asylum decision rate fell to **24% in May** (vs. 50%+ in 2023\u20132024)\n- Venezuelans have replaced Syrians as the top asylum-applying nationality in 2025\n\n**Source reliability:** Thomson Reuters Foundation (high reliability)\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve IOM Missing Migrants Project year-to-date totals (dead+missing) for the Mediterranean for every year 2014-2025 through 30 April and any preliminary 2026 figures; list whether totals exceeded 1,000.\nThe objective was to compile, for every calendar year 2014-2025, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Missing Migrants Project\u2019s cumulative Mediterranean death-plus-missing total recorded up to and including 30 April, to note whether each year\u2019s subtotal had already surpassed the 1,000-death threshold, and to provide whatever preliminary 2026 figure is available.  \n\n1. Years for which a concrete 1 Jan \u2013 30 Apr Mediterranean total is documented in open reporting\n\n\u2022 2014 \u2013 96 deaths and disappearances up to 30 April (BBC News, 22 Apr 2015).  \n\u2003Exceeded 1,000? No.  \n\n\u2022 2015 \u2013 \u201cMore than 1,700 people are believed to have died this year so far\u201d (reference date 22 April 2015, BBC News, 22 Apr 2015).  \n\u2003Exceeded 1,000? Yes.  \n\n\u2022 2016 \u2013 1,855 deaths recorded by 31 May 2016; the 30 April subtotal is not given, but the figure necessarily exceeded 1,000 before May (UN News, 31 May 2016).  \n\u2003Exceeded 1,000? Yes.  \n\nThose three items are the only instances found in the public domain that explicitly state (or allow a safe inference about) the Missing Migrants Project Mediterranean tally before the end of April in a given year. All other materials located either:\n\na) provide full-year totals,  \nb) quote figures for different geographic aggregations (e.g., \u201cCentral Mediterranean\u201d only), or  \nc) stop at other cut-off dates (e.g., Q1, end-May, end-August).\n\n2. Years with partial or route-specific early-year information that is insufficient for the 30 April, all-Mediterranean requirement\n\n\u2022 2023 \u2013 IOM cited 441 deaths on the Central Mediterranean route in Q1 (Euronews, 12 Apr 2023). The figure excludes the Eastern and Western sub-regions and covers only 31 March. Whether the all-route 30 April total topped 1,000 cannot be answered.\n\n\u2022 2024 \u2013 As of 17 September 2024 the Missing Migrants Project listed 1,450 Mediterranean deaths (UN News, 30 Sep 2024). No 30 April figure located.\n\n\u2022 2025 \u2013 IOM said at least 555 people died on Mediterranean or Atlantic sea routes in the first three months of 2025 (Guardian, 16 Apr 2025). The statement merges two basins and ends 31 March.\n\nFor 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 no source in the retrieved material gives a Mediterranean-wide cumulative death-plus-missing number through 30 April.\n\n3. Preliminary 2026 picture\n\n\u2022 At least 606 people were reported dead or missing on the Mediterranean route between 1 January and 22 February 2026, making it \u201cthe deadliest start to a year since IOM began recording such data in 2014\u201d (Guardian, 23 Feb 2026; Ground News aggregate, 24 Feb 2026).  \n\u200330 April 2026 total: not yet published.  \n\u2003Exceeded 1,000? Indeterminate.\n\n4. Consolidated table of substantiated data\n\nYear | Mediterranean dead + missing 1 Jan \u2013 30 Apr | \u22651,000? | Source\n---- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------\n2014 | 96 | No | BBC, 22 Apr 2015\n2015 | >1,700 | Yes | BBC, 22 Apr 2015\n2016 | >1,000 (1,855 by 31 May) | Yes | UN News, 31 May 2016\n2017 | \u2014 (no 30 Apr figure) | Unknown | \u2014\n2018 | \u2014 | Unknown | \u2014\n2019 | \u2014 | Unknown | \u2014\n2020 | \u2014 | Unknown | \u2014\n2021 | \u2014 | Unknown | \u2014\n2022 | \u2014 | Unknown | \u2014\n2023 | \u2265441 (Central Med only, Q1) | Unclear | Euronews, 12 Apr 2023\n2024 | \u2014 | Unknown | \u2014\n2025 | \u2265555 (Med + Atlantic, Q1) | Unclear | Guardian, 16 Apr 2025\n2026 | 606 (to 22 Feb) | Not yet | Guardian, 23 Feb 2026; Ground News, 24 Feb 2026\n\n5. Key findings relevant to the 2026 forecasting task\n\n\u2022 Documented evidence confirms that Mediterranean deaths exceeded 1,000 before May in at least two years: 2015 and 2016.  \n\u2022 No reliable 30 April data are publicly available for 2017-2025, so the historical frequency of sub-May 1,000-death years cannot be fully assessed.  \n\u2022 The 606 fatalities reported by 22 February 2026 indicate an exceptionally rapid death rate\u2014roughly 11 deaths per day. Continuation at even half that pace would push the cumulative total beyond 1,000 well before 30 April, but the Missing Migrants dataset must confirm the actual figure.  \n\n6. Information gaps that remain\n\n\u2022 Exact 30 April Mediterranean death-plus-missing totals for 2017-2025.  \n\u2022 Official IOM cumulative figure for 1 Jan-30 Apr 2026.  \n\nTo close these gaps\u2014and thus deliver a complete historical series\u2014access to the underlying Missing Migrants Project database (CSV download or API) filtered on Incident Date \u2264 30 April and Region = \u201cMediterranean\u201d would be required; the published press lines and media reports alone do not furnish the needed year-to-date snapshots.</Agent_report>\n"
