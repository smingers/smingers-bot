Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Key relevant sources:**

1. **Central News Agency (Feb 23, 2026) – Rep. Judy Chu statement**: High-quality source (Taiwan's official news agency). Factual: H.R. 33 passed the House with 423-1 vote; bill is now awaiting Senate passage and presidential signature. Chu is an identifiable expert (House Appropriations Committee member). This confirms current legislative status as of late February 2026.

2. **UDN (Feb 23, 2026) – Rep. Judy Chu**: Corroborates CNA report. Same factual content: House passed 423-1, awaiting Senate and presidential signature. Moderate-high quality (major Taiwanese news outlet).

3. **Taiwan News (Jan 19, 2026) – FAPA statement**: FAPA (Formosan Association for Public Affairs) urges Congress to pass the bill "without delay." Opinion from an advocacy organization. Confirms bill has not yet passed Senate as of January 2026. Moderate quality.

4. **Liberty Times Net (Jan 23, 2026) – Sen. Gallego visit**: Taiwan's President Lai urged Gallego to "expedite the review and passage" of the bill. Factual: confirms the bill is still pending Senate action as of January 23, 2026. High quality.

5. **CNA (Jan 20, 2026) – Vice Premier Zheng Lijun**: U.S. expressed willingness to "initiate talks to accelerate the ADTA's procedural implementation." This refers to the broader double-taxation avoidance agreement framework, not specifically H.R. 33. Moderate quality; somewhat ambiguous.

6. **Yahoo News Taiwan / CNA (Dec 3-4, 2025) – Taiwan's U.S. Representative Yu Ta-wei**: Expressed optimism that the bill "could be enacted by next year [2026]." This is an opinion/aspiration from a diplomat, not a factual statement about legislative progress. Moderate quality; aspirational.

7. **Epoch Times / CNA (Feb 26, 2026) – Iowa State Legislature resolution**: Iowa passed a resolution supporting Taiwan and "advocating for the early completion of a U.S.-Taiwan tax treaty." This is a state-level resolution with no binding effect on federal legislation. Weak evidence for federal enactment.

8. **CLAconnect (early 2024) – H.R. 7024 analysis**: Confirms the Taiwan double-tax relief was previously embedded in H.R. 7024 (118th Congress), which passed the House but died in the Senate. Historical context; moderate quality.

9. **CT Mirror (July 2025) – "One Big Beautiful Bill Act"**: Confirms the reconciliation bill was signed into law. Relevant because it shows the major tax vehicle for 2025 has already been enacted, meaning H.R. 33 was NOT included in it. Strong negative evidence.

10. **Other sources** (Florida infant safety, Israel Act, Medicare cancer screening, tariff refund bill): Entirely irrelevant to H.R. 33.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence (large weight toward No):**

- **Senate inaction for 13+ months**: H.R. 33 passed the House on January 16, 2025. As of February 27, 2026, the Senate has taken no action. This is 13+ months of inaction. Multiple independent sources (CNA, Liberty Times, FAPA, Yu Ta-wei) all confirm the bill is still pending Senate action. This structural factor is highly predictive.

- **"One Big Beautiful Bill" already enacted (July 2025)**: The major tax reconciliation vehicle for the 119th Congress has already been signed into law, and H.R. 33 was NOT included. This eliminates the most likely legislative vehicle for attaching the Taiwan provision.

- **Historical base rate**: Zero stand-alone bilateral double-tax relief bills enacted since 2000. The predecessor (118th Congress version) passed the House but died in the Senate.

**Moderate evidence (moderate weight toward No):**

- **63-day timeframe**: Only ~63 days remain until May 1, 2026. Senate would need committee markup, floor vote, and presidential signature. No committee action has been scheduled.

- **Congressional focus on other priorities**: Tariff negotiations, defense spending, and other geopolitical issues dominate the legislative agenda. The Senate Finance Committee is occupied with other matters.

**Moderate evidence (small weight toward Yes):**

- **Bipartisan support**: 423-1 House vote is extraordinarily strong. Rep. Judy Chu actively seeking Senate support as of February 23, 2026.

- **U.S. signaling**: Vice Premier Zheng's January 20 statement that the U.S. expressed willingness to "accelerate" the double-tax agreement process. However, this refers to executive-branch discussions, not Senate floor action.

- **Strategic importance**: Multiple U.S. officials and Taiwan's president have publicly called for passage. Iowa and Indiana state legislatures passed supporting resolutions.

**Weak evidence (minimal weight toward Yes):**

- **Yu Ta-wei's optimism (Dec 2025)**: Aspirational statement from Taiwan's U.S. representative that the bill "could pass by 2026." This is a diplomatic hope, not a legislative commitment.

- **State legislature resolutions**: Iowa and Indiana passed supporting resolutions, but these have no binding effect on federal legislation.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question resolves May 1, 2026 — approximately **63 days** from the question opening date (February 27, 2026).

**If timeframe were halved (~31 days):** Probability would drop to ~1-2%. Even less time for Senate action, and no evidence of imminent scheduling.

**If timeframe were doubled (~126 days, ~July 1, 2026):** Probability would rise modestly to perhaps 5-7%. More time for Senate action, but still facing structural barriers (Senate inaction, no committee markup scheduled, competing priorities). The second half of 2026 is when midterm election dynamics might either accelerate or freeze legislation.

The 63-day window is extremely tight given that:
- Senate Finance Committee has not scheduled a markup
- No floor time has been allocated
- Congressional recess periods (likely in April) reduce available legislative days
- The Senate typically requires unanimous consent or 60 votes for expedited consideration

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate is 3% (from the analysis of stand-alone bilateral double-tax relief bills having a 0% historical enactment rate, adjusted upward for the bill having passed the House with extraordinary bipartisan support).

**Factors that could shift upward:**
- The 423-1 House vote is genuinely extraordinary and signals Senate could act quickly if scheduled
- Active diplomatic pressure from Taiwan's president and U.S. representative
- U.S. executive branch signaling willingness to accelerate
- The bill is relatively non-controversial (bipartisan, economically beneficial)

**Factors that keep probability very low:**
- 13+ months of Senate inaction despite House passage — this is the single most powerful piece of evidence
- The major tax vehicle ("One Big Beautiful Bill") has already been enacted without H.R. 33
- No evidence of Senate Finance Committee scheduling a markup
- Only 63 days remain
- Historical precedent: zero similar bills enacted since 2000
- Senate is focused on tariff negotiations and geopolitical issues

The Senate inaction is particularly telling. If the Senate were going to act, the most natural vehicle (the reconciliation bill) has already passed. The next opportunity would be either unanimous consent (which requires no objection from any senator — a high bar) or a standalone floor vote (which requires 60 votes to proceed). Neither appears imminent.

The diplomatic activity (Judy Chu seeking bipartisan support, Iowa/Indiana resolutions, Taiwan's president urging passage) suggests the bill's supporters are still pushing but have not secured Senate commitment. If Senate passage were imminent, we would expect to see news of a Senate Finance Committee markup or floor scheduling — which is absent.

**Final calibration:** The outside view base rate of 3% should be maintained or slightly reduced given the 63-day window and 13+ months of Senate inaction. I'll set my inside view at **3%**.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view base rate is 3%. The current information:
- Confirms Senate has not acted (strong negative)
- Shows active advocacy but no concrete Senate scheduling (moderate negative)
- Shows extraordinary bipartisan House support (small positive)
- Shows executive-branch interest in acceleration (small positive)
- Shows the major tax vehicle has already been enacted without H.R. 33 (moderate negative)

Net adjustment: The evidence is predominantly negative, but the extraordinary bipartisan support and active diplomatic pressure provide a small upward nudge. However, the 63-day window and 13+ months of Senate inaction are decisive. I maintain the outside view at **3%**.

---

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria**: H.R. 33 must receive "Became Public Law" status on Congress.gov before May 1, 2026 (~63 days from now).

2. **Outside view base rate**: 3% (zero historical enactments of similar stand-alone bilateral double-tax relief bills; adjusted upward for House passage).

3. **Consistency check**: "3 out of 100 times, H.R. 33 becomes law before May 1, 2026." This makes sense given 13+ months of Senate inaction, 63-day window, and historical precedent.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - H.R. 33 passed House 423-1 in January 2025 but Senate has taken no action in 13+ months (factually confirmed by multiple sources)
   - "One Big Beautiful Bill" enacted July 2025 without H.R. 33 (confirmed by CT Mirror)
   - No Senate Finance Committee markup scheduled (absence of evidence, confirmed by lack of any news)
   - Rep. Judy Chu actively seeking Senate support as of Feb 23, 2026 (confirms bill still pending)
   - Historical base rate: zero similar bills enacted since 2000

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: The Senate could attach H.R. 33 to an emergency or must-pass bill (e.g., a continuing resolution or supplemental appropriations bill) in the next 63 days. This is the scenario most likely to make a 3% forecast look wrong. However, there's no current evidence of this being planned, and the bill's subject matter (tax relief for Taiwan residents) doesn't fit the typical emergency/must-pass vehicle profile.

6. **Status quo**: The status quo is Senate inaction. The world changes slowly. 63 days is a short window for a bill that has sat idle for 13+ months.

Probability: 3%
