Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**AskNews: Judy Chu articles (Feb 23, 2026, CNA/UDN)** — High quality; Central News Agency is Taiwan's official state news wire, reliable for factual reporting. Key factual claim: H.R. 33 passed the House 423-1 and is awaiting Senate passage and presidential signature. Rep. Chu is an identifiable expert/actor. This is strong factual evidence about the bill's current legislative status.

**AskNews: Taiwan Representative Yu Ta-wei (Dec 3-4, 2025, CNA/Liberty Times/Yahoo)** — Moderate-high quality. Yu is an identifiable official (Taiwan's representative to the U.S.). Factual claim: bill passed House in 2025, now awaiting Senate. Opinion: "optimistic for 2026 passage." The opinion is from a stakeholder with incentive to be optimistic, so discounted.

**AskNews: FAPA statement (Jan 19, 2026, Taiwan News)** — Moderate quality. FAPA is an advocacy organization; their urging Congress to pass the bill "without delay" is advocacy, not evidence of imminent passage. Factual: confirms Taiwan is "the only major U.S. trading partner without a double tax avoidance agreement."

**AskNews: Taiwan Vice Premier Zheng Lijun (Jan 19-20, 2026, CNA/Liberty Times)** — High quality. Factual claim: "U.S. has expressed interest in initiating talks to accelerate the ADTA's procedural implementation." This is diplomatic language suggesting talks are beginning, not that legislation is imminent. Notably, this refers to the executive-branch agreement process, distinct from H.R. 33's Senate passage.

**AskNews: Iowa State Legislature resolution (Feb 26, 2026, Epoch Times/CNA)** — Moderate quality. State legislature resolutions are non-binding. Factual: Iowa passed a resolution advocating for early completion of a U.S.-Taiwan tax treaty. This shows subnational support but has no direct legislative effect on H.R. 33.

**AskNews: Taiwan President Lai meeting with Sen. Gallego (Jan 23-24, 2026)** — Moderate quality. Factual: Lai urged Gallego to help expedite the Double Taxation Relief Act. Gallego is one senator; this is advocacy, not a commitment to act.

**AskNews: Taiwan-American Chamber of Commerce survey (Jan 27, 2026)** — Moderate quality. Survey data: 76% of respondents emphasized "critical importance" of completing a double taxation avoidance agreement. This shows business community pressure but not legislative action.

**CLAconnect article on H.R. 7024 (early 2024)** — Moderate quality. Confirms the Taiwan double-tax relief concept was embedded in a broader tax bill (H.R. 7024) that passed the House in 2024 but failed in the Senate. Historical context showing prior failure.

**CT Mirror/AP gambling tax article (Jul 2025)** — Irrelevant to H.R. 33.

**KFGO tariff refund bill (Feb 23, 2026)** — Irrelevant to H.R. 33.

**Other AskNews articles (Taiwan property tax, semiconductor geopolitics, etc.)** — Background context only; not directly relevant to H.R. 33's Senate prospects.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence against resolution:**
- Historical reference class: Stand-alone international double-tax-relief bills have a 0% enactment rate over ~25 years (Agent report from outside view). This is the most powerful single piece of evidence.
- Senate has not scheduled H.R. 33 for a vote. As of Feb 27, 2026, there is no reporting of Senate Finance Committee markup, floor scheduling, or unanimous consent agreement. The bill is simply "awaiting Senate passage."
- The 64-day window (Feb 27 – May 1, 2026) is extremely tight. The Senate is in its early-year period, focused on budget reconciliation (the "One Big Beautiful Bill" process), tariff policy, and other priorities. Senate calendars are crowded.
- Prior vehicle (H.R. 7024 in 2024) that included Taiwan double-tax relief passed the House but died in the Senate — directly analogous failure.

**Moderate evidence for resolution:**
- H.R. 33 passed the House 423-1 (essentially unanimous), demonstrating extraordinary bipartisan support. This reduces the risk of Senate opposition on the merits.
- Multiple high-level actors are actively pushing: Taiwan's president, vice premier, representative to U.S., and FAPA are all publicly urging passage. This creates political pressure.
- U.S. expressed willingness to "initiate talks to accelerate" the ADTA process (Jan 2026) — suggests executive branch engagement, though this may refer to a parallel executive agreement track rather than H.R. 33 specifically.
- The bill is relatively non-controversial and could theoretically be passed via unanimous consent or as part of a larger package.

**Weak evidence for resolution:**
- Iowa and Indiana state legislature resolutions supporting U.S.-Taiwan tax treaty — non-binding, no direct effect.
- Taiwan-American Chamber of Commerce survey showing business support — advocacy, not legislative action.
- Yu Ta-wei's optimism about 2026 passage — stakeholder with incentive to be optimistic.

**Net assessment:** The evidence strongly suggests the bill has favorable political conditions (bipartisan support, stakeholder pressure, executive interest) but faces severe structural barriers: Senate scheduling constraints, the 64-day window, competing legislative priorities (budget reconciliation is consuming Senate bandwidth), and the historical pattern of such bills failing.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**64 days** remain (Feb 27 – May 1, 2026). This is a very short window.

- If the window were **halved** (~32 days): probability would drop to perhaps 1-1.5%, as the Senate would need to act almost immediately.
- If the window were **doubled** (~128 days, through ~July 1): probability would rise modestly to perhaps 4-6%, as the Senate would have more time, though still before the typical "busy season" of Oct-Dec.

The key constraint is not just time but Senate scheduling. The Senate is currently consumed by budget reconciliation (the "One Big Beautiful Bill" process), tariff policy responses, and other priorities. A standalone bill or unanimous consent agreement for H.R. 33 would require Senate leadership to prioritize it, which seems unlikely given competing demands.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate of 1.5%.

**Upward adjustments:**
1. The 423-1 House vote is extraordinary and removes the usual concern about Senate opposition on the merits. Bills with this level of bipartisan support can sometimes be hot-lined (passed by unanimous consent) without floor time. This is the primary mechanism by which H.R. 33 could pass quickly. Adjust up: +1.5 pp.

2. Active high-level diplomatic pressure from Taiwan's president, vice premier, and U.S. representative, combined with U.S. executive branch expressed interest in accelerating the process, suggests this is not a dormant bill. Adjust up: +0.5 pp.

3. The bill is relatively simple and non-controversial in substance. It doesn't require 60 votes if passed by unanimous consent. Adjust up: +0.5 pp.

**Downward adjustments:**
1. Senate is currently focused on budget reconciliation, which is consuming the Finance Committee's bandwidth. The Finance Committee would need to act on H.R. 33. Adjust down: -1 pp.

2. The prior vehicle (H.R. 7024) that included Taiwan double-tax relief died in the Senate in 2024 despite House passage — direct historical parallel. Adjust down: -0.5 pp.

3. No reporting of any Senate scheduling action, committee markup, or floor agreement as of Feb 27, 2026. Status quo is inaction. Adjust down: -0.5 pp.

**Net adjustment:** +1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 - 1.0 - 0.5 - 0.5 = +0.5 pp above base rate.

**Inside view estimate:** ~2.0%

The primary scenario for Yes resolution: Senate Majority Leader schedules H.R. 33 for unanimous consent (hot-line) passage, perhaps as a goodwill gesture in the context of broader U.S.-Taiwan economic negotiations (tariff deal, TSMC investments). This is plausible but not probable given competing priorities.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view base rate is 1.5%. The inside view evidence provides modest upward pressure (strong bipartisan support, active diplomatic pressure, executive interest) but is countered by structural barriers (Senate scheduling, competing priorities, historical failure of similar bills, 64-day window). 

I settle on **2%** as my inside view prediction. This reflects:
- The near-zero historical base rate for such bills
- A modest upward adjustment for the extraordinary House vote and active diplomatic pressure
- The severe constraint of a 64-day window during a period of Senate congestion
- The status quo being inaction

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will H.R. 33 (Taiwan double-tax relief) be signed into law (public law designation on Congress.gov) between Feb 27 and May 1, 2026? ✓

2. **Outside view base rate:** 1.5% (0% historical for stand-alone international double-tax bills, adjusted up for House passage). Final prediction of 2% is rooted in this base rate with modest upward adjustment. ✓

3. **Consistency check:** "2 out of 100 times, H.R. 33 becomes public law before May 1, 2026." This is consistent with my analysis — possible but highly unlikely given Senate inaction and 64-day window. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - H.R. 33 passed House 423-1 (strong bipartisan support, enables unanimous consent path) ✓
   - No Senate scheduling action reported as of Feb 27, 2026 (status quo = inaction) ✓
   - Historical: 0% enactment rate for stand-alone international double-tax bills ✓
   - Senate focused on budget reconciliation (competing priorities) ✓
   - Prior H.R. 7024 (included Taiwan tax relief) died in Senate 2024 ✓

5. **Blind spot:** The one scenario that would make this forecast look silly: Senate Majority Leader McConnell/Thune hot-lines H.R. 33 as part of a broader U.S.-Taiwan economic package tied to TSMC investment announcements or tariff negotiations. This is the most plausible surprise path. If this were to happen, it would likely be preceded by news coverage I don't currently see. Probability shift: would move to ~15-20% if credible reports of Senate scheduling emerged.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo is that the Senate has not acted on H.R. 33 and is unlikely to prioritize it in the next 64 days. The world changes slowly; absent a specific trigger event, inaction is the default. This supports staying near the base rate.

Probability: 2%
