Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (for grounding)
This resolves **Yes** if **Congress.gov** shows **H.R. 33 became law / got a public-law number** at any time **from 2026-02-27 through 2026-04-30 (before May 1, 2026)**. Otherwise **No**.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality/date; facts vs opinions)
Unrelated / low relevance (do not update much):
- FloridaPolitics (Feb 2026) about Florida “baby boxes”: unrelated; discard.
- Sen. Capito press release on “Stand with Israel Act”: unrelated; discard.
- ABC3340 on H.R. 842 Medicare cancer screening: unrelated; discard.
- CT Mirror/AP (Jul 2025) on gambling deduction: unrelated; discard.
- KFGO (Feb 23 2026) tariff refunds bill: unrelated; discard.
- AskNews Taiwan property-tax / stock-market / Ukraine / cultural miscellany: unrelated to H.R. 33 enactment mechanics; discard.

Relevant / partially relevant:
- Central News Agency (CNA) (Feb 23 2026) + UDN (Feb 23 2026): reports Rep. **Judy Chu** says the **double-tax relief bill passed the House 423–1** and is **awaiting Senate passage + presidential signature**. These are credible outlets for *reported statements*; the **facts** are the vote claim + current “awaiting Senate” status (consistent with the bill being stalled). Her optimism/advocacy is **opinion**.
- Taiwan News (Jan 19 2026): advocacy group (FAPA) urges Congress to pass; shows lobbying interest, but largely **opinion**. Medium reliability; useful only as “pressure exists,” not as an indicator of Senate scheduling.
- Liberty Times Net (Jan 23 2026) and on.cc (Jan 24 2026): report Sen. **Ruben Gallego** visit; Taiwan’s president urges expedited passage. This is credible as reporting of a visit; however it’s **not evidence of Senate action** (mostly diplomatic messaging).
- Liberty Times video + CNA (Jan 20 2026): Taiwan VP says U.S. agreed to “accelerated talks” on ADTA implementation process. That’s relevant context but refers to **talks**, not **U.S. Senate calendar/markup**; moderate indirect signal at best.
- CLAconnect (early 2024): shows the Taiwan double-tax relief concept was previously embedded in a larger U.S. tax bill (H.R. 7024). High-quality as a technical/accounting explainer; older, but relevant for the **mechanism** “could pass via larger vehicle.”
- AskNews “Deep Research Analysis” paragraph: notes inability to find direct recent coverage; highlights tariffs, geopolitics, and a possible Trump–Xi summit effect. This is a **meta-summary** without direct citations in the excerpt; treat as **weak-to-moderate** unless corroborated elsewhere.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (structural / predictive):
- **Very short runway (≈63 days)** for: Senate action (likely committee/UC) + floor passage + presidential signature + administrative posting. This is a hard constraint.
- **Status quo:** Despite House passage long ago, there is **no presented evidence of Senate Finance markup, Senate floor scheduling, or an announced “vehicle”** that will carry it before May 1. Senate inaction is a strong negative in short windows.

Moderate evidence (some momentum but indirect):
- **Overwhelming House vote (423–1)** (CNA/UDN via Chu statement) suggests broad bipartisan support and reduces risk of controversy *if* it reaches the Senate floor.
- Repeated Taiwanese-side public pushes (Gallego visit; VP statements; business community emphasis) imply sustained priority in bilateral economic agenda—could marginally raise odds it’s attached to something.

Weak evidence (small nudges only):
- Advocacy/opinion pieces (FAPA; business surveys; state legislature resolutions in Iowa/Indiana): signal desire but don’t move Senate scheduling probability much.
- Geopolitical/tariff backdrop: could cut both ways (carrot to Taiwan vs. bargaining chip with China), so net is ambiguous without direct legislative linkage.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: from **2026-02-27 to 2026-05-01 = ~63 days**.
- If timeframe were **halved** (~31 days): probability would fall sharply because Senate floor time is the bottleneck; I’d likely cut my estimate by ~40–60%.
- If timeframe were **doubled** (~126 days, to early July 2026): odds would rise meaningfully because more “vehicle opportunities” (tax package, trade package, pre-election positioning) appear; I’d likely increase by ~50–100% relative (not +50 points).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside-view base rate given: **3.5%** (anchored on the historical difficulty of stand-alone double-tax relief measures and the short window).

Updates from current information:
Reasons to move up from 3.5% (but not dramatically):
1) **House passage is massive and bipartisan (423–1)**, reducing the chance that *substantive opposition* kills it; the main barrier is scheduling/vehicle, not ideology. (Moderate +)
2) Prior precedent for embedding Taiwan double-tax relief into a broader tax vehicle (CLAconnect’s H.R. 7024 discussion) suggests an enactment path that bypasses stand-alone Senate friction. (Moderate +)
3) Continued diplomatic and business pressure in early 2026 indicates the issue hasn’t gone dormant. (Weak-to-moderate +)

Reasons not to move much (dominant constraints):
1) **No direct evidence here of Senate movement** (no markup, no UC agreement, no leadership commitment, no announced package) as of opening day. In a 63-day window, lacking that is usually fatal. (Strong −)
2) Enactment requires not just passage but also **becoming public law** before May 1—adds procedural time and reduces last-minute probability. (Strong −)

Net: I modestly increase from 3.5% to reflect (i) unusual bipartisan House support and (ii) plausible “attach-to-vehicle” route, but keep it low due to the tight window and absence of concrete Senate signals.

Probability calibration
- Status quo (nothing changes): **No**.
- Key decomposition (rough):
  - P(Senate takes it up and passes by May 1) is the gating factor. With no clear Senate action presented, I put this in the mid-single-digits.
  - Conditional on Senate passage, P(presidential signature + enacted status posted in time) is high (≈80–95%), but not the bottleneck.
- My inside-view estimate: **6%**.
  - A ±10% absolute swing (to 16%) would require clear evidence of Senate scheduling/vehicle imminence, which we do not have; dropping to ~0–2% would require evidence the Senate has explicitly deprioritized/blocked it, which we also do not have.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Will **H.R. 33** show **“Became Public Law…” on Congress.gov** between **2026-02-27 and before 2026-05-01**?
2) Outside view base rate: **3.5%**.
3) Consistency check: **6 out of 100 times**, H.R. 33 becomes law and gets a public-law designation by May 1, 2026.
4) Top evidence (≤20 words each):
   - Only ~63 days; enactment requires Senate action + signature + public-law posting.
   - Judy Chu reports House passed 423–1; bill still awaiting Senate.
   - Past effort to include similar Taiwan tax relief inside a larger tax vehicle (H.R. 7024).
   - No cited Senate markup/scheduling/vehicle commitment as of Feb 27, 2026.
5) Blind spot: A “must-pass” tax/trade package emerges in March/April and leadership adds H.R. 33 at the last minute.
6) Status quo outcome: Senate continues to focus elsewhere; bill remains pending → **No**.

Probability: 6%
