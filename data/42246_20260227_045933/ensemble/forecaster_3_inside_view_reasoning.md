**Evaluating legislative forecast**

I'm focusing on a superforecast style here. The House passed a resolution in January 2025, and reports from February 2026 indicate it passed with a strong vote of 423-1, awaiting the Senate and presidential signature. The resolution must be enacted between February 27 and May 1, 2026, giving a 63-day window. As of now, it hasn't been enacted. I’ll adjust the probability estimate to 3.5%, considering strong bipartisan support and potential attachments to other legislative packages, but there’s been no Senate action yet.**Assessing legislative probabilities**

I’m evaluating the timing surrounding the resolution’s potential enactment before May 1, 2026. The spring 2026 legislative calendar features important legislation like the budget and FAA. With the current administration in its second term, there might be some strategic use of tariffs with Taiwan, but potential summits could complicate things. 

My initial estimate for the probability of enactment is around 3.5%, but given its significance and prior House passage, I might raise it to 5-8%. The chance of Senate action and presidential signing will drive the overall probability, but right now, committee actions are the missing puzzle piece.**Finalizing probability estimation**

I’m settling on a probability estimate of around 6%. It’s crucial to evaluate my sources and include any irrelevant disclaimers quickly. My format will consist of an analysis section with source analysis, evidence weighting, timeframe considerations, and justification. 

I need to carefully paraphrase my criteria and remember not to count events before February 27, 2026, since enactment will occur afterward. However, the previous House passage is a positive factor. Now, I’ll start crafting the final analysis!
