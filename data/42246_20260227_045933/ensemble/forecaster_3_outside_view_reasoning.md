**Analyzing legislative patterns**

I'm looking at bills passed by the House that are waiting for Senate action or those that passed in the previous year. I could estimate that house-passed bills have a low probability of being enacted by May 1, 2026, especially since many are enacted closer to the end of a session. I need to break down sources and include evaluations on various classes of bills, focusing on those that are relevant. Ultimately, I’ll consider House-passed tax bills pending in the Senate.**Estimating bill enactment probability**

I'm thinking about the timeline for bills becoming law. Many bills are enacted in the final quarter of the session, implying that by May 1, about 40% of the year's eventual enactments might have already occurred. For a specific bill's probability of becoming law by that date, if it’s a House-passed, bipartisan bill, I’d say it’s likely. My estimate would be that the chance for this bill to become law is around 10-20% by May 1.**Assessing bill probability**

I'm evaluating H.R. 5988, which passed the House in January 2024 but hasn't been enacted, alongside S. 3084 that was reported but not enacted. This suggests a blockage in the Senate for the Taiwan tax deal, leading to a low probability of enactment. Geopolitical factors could influence things, but looking strictly at the data puts my estimate around 12.7%. Since there's a short timeframe of 63 days, I’m considering fast-tracking options, leading me to set the probability for enactment at around 9.8%.**Calculating enactment chances**

I realize the bill has to pass the Senate and be signed within two months, especially during an election year. There’s uncertainty about whether it could be included in a tax extenders package around April, which complicates things. Given these factors, I’m estimating the probability of successful enactment at about 11.3%. This takes into account the tight timeframe and potential legislative hurdles involved, so I feel it’s a reasonable assessment!
