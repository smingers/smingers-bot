Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. CNA 23 Feb 2026 article quoting Rep. Judy Chu – factual, primary‐source comments from the bill’s House sponsor; published four days ago; high quality on status (House passed, now in Senate).  
2. CNA & Epoch Times 26 Feb 2026 Iowa-legislature resolutions – factual but indirect; show continuing sub-national pressure; moderate quality, limited direct bearing.  
3. AskNews packet – dozens of Taiwan-related economic pieces; only the Judy Chu report is directly on H.R. 33. Others give background mood; weak relevance.  
4. CLAconnect Jan 2024 explainer on H.R. 7024 – reliable professional tax note that the same Taiwan language was once embedded in a broader tax bill; shows precedent for hitch-hiking strategy; moderate relevance.  
5. GovTrack historical statistics – official, aggregate data on enactment timing; strong quality for base-rate calibration.  
6. Agent synthesis of previous Taiwan double-tax bills (2000-2024) – secondary; indicates repeated Senate failures; moderate quality, strong caution signal.

Factual vs. opinion separation: Only Rep. Chu and state resolutions express explicit opinions (“should pass”). Evidence weight rests on the factual procedural status (House passage, Senate not yet acted).

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• House passage 423-1 (CNA) – bipartisan support and procedural advance.  
• Only 63 days remain (calendar constraint) – structural hurdle (GovTrack timing).  
Moderate evidence  
• Historical pattern: similar Taiwan bills have never cleared the Senate (agent synthesis).  
• Prior inclusion in omnibus tax bill in 2024 (CLAconnect) – shows viable vehicle strategy.  
• State-level and business lobbying (Iowa, FAPA, Judy Chu quotes) – maintains momentum.  
Weak evidence  
• General pro-Taiwan mood, tariff friction, semiconductor geopolitics – indirect, volatile.

Net directional pull: House passage & bipartisan goodwill push probability upward; short clock and poor Senate track record pull it downward. Strength roughly balances with slight upward tilt from my original 11.3 % outside view.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: 63 days.  
If the window were doubled (to 4 months) I would raise probability by ~+9 pp (to ~27 %) because summer tax-extender or NDAA vehicles become available.  
If halved (to one month) I’d cut probability by roughly one-third (to ~12 %) because filing, scoring, and floor time become nearly impossible.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate (House-passed bills enacted within two months) ≈ 10-15 %.  
+6 pp: Extraordinary 423-1 vote signals almost no ideological opposition.  
+3 pp: Existence of prior scored language that could be pasted into a March/April tax or tariff package reduces drafting friction.  
−5 pp: No Senate committee action yet; Finance Committee backlog (tariff refund bill, ERC claw-backs) and Easter recess leave perhaps 15 working days.  
−3 pp: Historical 0-for-many record of stand-alone Taiwan tax bills; indicates hidden obstacles (treaty model concerns, China signaling).  
Net = 11 % + 6 + 3 − 5 − 3 ≈ 12 %.

I round slightly upward, judging current lobbying intensity could drop one of the obstacles.

Probability calibration:
“I expect that 18 out of 100 times H.R. 33 would become public law by 1 May 2026 under circumstances resembling today.”

Checklist:
1. Will H.R. 33 receive “Became Public Law” status on Congress.gov between 27 Feb and 1 May 2026?  
2. Outside-view base rate used: 11.3 %.  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key factors:  
   • House passed 423-1.  
   • Only 63 days left & few Senate workdays.  
   • No Senate committee action yet.  
   • Prior similar bills stalled.  
   • Possible attachment to near-term tax vehicle.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden April omnibus (e.g., Ukraine/Israel/Taiwan aid + tax extenders) where leadership adds H.R. 33 at the last minute. Would push probability well over 50 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome = bill languishes in Senate; hence slight nudge toward “No” retained.

Probability: 18%
