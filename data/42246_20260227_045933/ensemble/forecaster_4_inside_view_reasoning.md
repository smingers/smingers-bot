**Evaluating bill status**

I’m working to craft a response based on the context at hand. I know the outside view showed an 11.3% probability, but we have some updated inside information: Representative Judy Chu noted that the bill passed the House with overwhelming support. It’s currently waiting for a Senate vote and presidential signature. This changes things! It seems we should consider the potential for enactment, especially with high bipartisan support, while keeping the midterm elections in mind.**Crafting analysis for H.R. 33**

I need to evaluate the path for H.R. 33. It requires Senate action and reconciliation, with just 63 days left. It could potentially be included in a larger tax bill or through fast-tracking via unanimous consent. Given the overwhelming House support, this suggests a smoother Senate experience, though it faces numerous competing priorities. I should consider external pressures, historical precedents, and potential must-pass bills. After assessing these factors, I anticipate an enactment probability of around 18%. Let's craft a thorough analysis and title it “Will H.R. 33 be enacted into law before May 1, 2026?”
