Analysis:

(a) Source analysis – quality, facts vs. opinion  
1. Tax Adviser article on H.R. 10468 (Jun 2025).  Reputable CPA journal; factual on a different bill.  Only opinion is that momentum for broader tax reform is “growing.”  Low direct relevance; weak evidence.  
2. Greenback Expat Tax Services blog (Jun 2025).  Commercial blog; facts about Trump’s pledge are verifiable, the rest is marketing opinion.  Not relevant to H.R. 33; very low weight.  
3. Tax Fairness Abroad op-ed (Jan 2026).  Advocacy group; combines facts (committee workloads) with the author’s opinion that 2026 “could be the year” for expat-tax reform.  Moderate quality for descriptive bandwidth constraint; opinions discounted.  
4. BillTrack50 “118th Congress” article (Jan 2025).  Factual statistics drawn from Congress.gov; editorial tone (“legislative theater”) is opinion.  Good quantitative base-rate data: only 3.3 % of introduced bills became law.  
5. GovTrack legislative-timing article (2024).  Historical aggregate data; strong methodological quality.  Key fact: about half of all bills that will become law do so in the final quarter of the two-year Congress.  Little opinion content.  
6. Center for Effective Lawmaking LES report (Mar 2023).  Peer-reviewed academic metrics; no direct relevance here.  
7. Norton civics explainer (2014).  Pure procedure; dated but accurate; no opinions of consequence.  
8. Senate Finance FAQ & History pages.  Procedural; no bearing on the forecast.  
9. Agent report (Feb 2026).  Synthesises Congress.gov searches.  Factual claim: since 2000, zero stand-alone foreign double-tax-relief bills have been enacted.  Methods are transparent; high weight.  Any normative language is minimal.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. All bills introduced in a Congress → 3–4 % enactment rate.  Too broad.  
2. House-passed bills still awaiting Senate action midway through the Congress → ~10–15 % eventual enactment historically, but most successes occur late in the second year, not by mid-second-year.  
3. Stand-alone international double-tax-relief bills (Agent report) → 0 % (0/≥6) over the last 25 years.  Very narrow but thematically identical to H.R. 33.  
Because H.R. 33 perfectly fits class 3 and the sample is not tiny (≥6 bills, 0 successes), that class is the most informative base rate.  I will, however, slightly blend in class 2 to recognise that H.R. 33 has already cleared one chamber.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days left until the May 1 2026 deadline: 64 days.  
Congress is in the second session of the 119th Congress; major tax bills overwhelmingly cluster in the fourth calendar quarter (Oct–Dec of the even-numbered year).  We are more than five months before that busy window.  Historically, fewer than 15 % of tax-related enactments occur in the February-April slice of an even-numbered year.  The Senate will also recess two full weeks for Easter/Passover (customarily late-March to early-April), leaving ~40 legislative days.

(d) Justification for the outside view  
• Base rate from reference class 3: 0/6 → 0 %.  
• Adjust upward because H.R. 33 already passed the House (many of the failures never cleared both chambers) and has bipartisan rhetorical support.  Rough benchmark: House-passed bills within a Congress still succeed ~10 % of the time, but very few do so inside a 64-day window.  
• Timing discount: only ~15 % of eventual successes happen in the Feb–Apr interval.  Multiplying 10 % × 15 % → 1.5 %.  
• Presidential veto threat is minimal (the bill is bipartisan and administratively uncontroversial), so no additional penalty.  
• Upset / surprise frequency: in modern U.S. legislation, genuinely unexpected last-minute enactments (e.g., identical stand-alone bills suddenly hot-lined in the Senate) probably run 1 in 50–100 across all bills => 1-2 %.  That is already captured by the 1.5 % figure.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 0 % (strict reference class).  
Up-adjust for having cleared the House: +1 – 2 pp.  
Down-adjust for short 64-day window, before typical “busy season”: ÷ ~6 (i.e., keep ~15 %).  
Net ≈ 1.3 %.  
Add a small cushion for tail uncertainty and modelling error → 1.5 %.

Outside View Prediction:
1.5 % (i.e., about 1 chance in 67) that H.R. 33 is enacted into law before 1 May 2026.
