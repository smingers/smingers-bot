**Evaluating legislation options**

I’m weighing different options for choosing a reference class. I might consider (a) all House bills introduced, which usually have a 3% success rate, (b) bills passed in the House but not yet enacted, or (c) specific foreign double tax relief bills that have a 0% rate over the past 20 years. It seems like choosing "House-passed tax bills needing Senate approval" might be more suitable, especially if I estimate a 10% chance of enactment by May 1, 2026.**Calculating probability for tax bills**

I think the probability of these bills being enacted in the final two months of the session is pretty low, around 2-5%. While tax bills often end up in larger packages, crafting the numbers gives me some perspective. 

I have several reference classes in mind:  
1. Stand-alone tax relief bills seem to have a probability of less than 1%.  
2. Overall House bills might be around 4%, though approaching the session’s end drops it to 0.5%.  
3. House-passed bills in Senate Finance could hit 5%, so I’m considering an outside view estimate of about 3%.  

Now, focusing on the 64 days left until May 1, 2026, I’d lower the probability to about 1% for enactment before that date. I’ll also want to touch on the potential for unexpected outcomes in my final answer.
