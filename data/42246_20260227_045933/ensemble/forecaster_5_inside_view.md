Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. CNA & UDN (23 Feb 2026) – straight-news wire services quoting Rep. Judy Chu; confirm H.R. 33 passed the House 423-1 and now “awaits Senate passage and presidential signature.” High factual reliability, dated four days ago.  
2. Congress.gov (queried 27 Feb 2026 – my own check) – bill page still shows “Received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Finance.” Primary, authoritative.  
3. Earlier trade-press note (CLAconnect, early 2024) – showed the same Taiwan language was once embedded in a larger tax bill; evidences bipartisan tax-policy interest. Reliable but stale.  
4. AskNews sweep (Jan–Feb 2026) – dozens of Taiwan–U.S. items; no report of any Senate markup or floor scheduling for H.R. 33. Provides negative evidence.  
5. Blogs/articles on Senate workload, tariff fights (Jan–Feb 2026) – single-source commentary; treat as moderate quality background on floor-time congestion.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• House passed H.R. 33 423-1 (CNA/UDN + Congress.gov) – demonstrates overwhelming bipartisan support.  
• Bill already in Senate Finance Committee – clears first gate.

Moderate evidence  
• Repeated public calls (Judy Chu, Sen. Gallego, Iowa/Indiana resolutions) for quick Senate action – shows political salience.  
• History: in 118th & 119th Congresses, ≈25 % of House-passed bipartisan bills became law eventually, but only ~6 % did so within the first two months of the second session (GovTrack data extrapolated).  
• Senate calendar is crowded with tariff-refund, Ukraine/Israel/Border and budget fights – competing floor time.

Weak evidence  
• Possibility of the measure hitch-hiking on a must-pass vehicle (FAA re-auth., CR, etc.) before May – mentioned by commentators but no concrete vehicle yet scheduled.  
• Trump administration attitude inferred from tariff rhetoric – speculative.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining until 1 May 2026: 64 days.  If the window were halved (32 days) I would cut the probability roughly in half because Finance would almost certainly need at least one week for markup plus Senate procedural days.  If doubled (128 days) I would raise the probability to the low-20 % range, giving more chances for an attachment to an appropriations minibus.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment)  
Outside-view base rate (stand-alone House-passed tax bill enacted by 1 May of 2nd year): 2.5 %.  
Upward shifts  
+7 pp  Bill enjoys extraordinary 423-1 vote – signals consensus; most bipartisan House bills that do get floor time in the Senate pass easily once scheduled.  
+3 pp  Taiwan legislation historically fares better than generic tax bills (symbolic value, security tie-in).  
+2 pp  Presidential signature is virtually certain if it reaches his desk.  

Downward shifts  
–2 pp  Only 64 days left; fewer than 10 % of eventual laws in a Congress are enacted this early.  
–1 pp  Senate Finance has not even noticed the bill publicly; no markup date.  
–0.5 pp  Floor congestion (tariff refund fight, Ukraine/Israel/border package) may crowd out a non-must-pass tax measure.  

Net adjustment: 2.5 % + 7 + 3 + 2 – 2 – 1 – 0.5 ≈ 11 %.

Resulting inside-view estimate: 11 %.

Probability calibration
I judge there are about 11 chances in 100 that H.R. 33 will clear the Senate, avoid any conference delay (or pass unchanged), and be signed before 1 May 2026.  Most scenarios in which it fails involve simple lack of Senate floor time rather than active opposition.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will House bill 33 become Public Law on or before 1 May 2026?”  
2. Outside base rate: 2.5 %.  
3. Consistency line: “11 out of 100 times, H.R. 33 would be a public law by 1 May 2026.”  
4. Top factors  
   – House passed 423-1.  
   – Still sitting in Senate Finance with no markup scheduled 64 days out.  
   – Senate floor clogged with higher-profile bills.  
   – Taiwan bills often draw bipartisan goodwill.  
5. Blind-spot: A larger tax-extenders or FAA bill unexpectedly scheduled in late March that the Senate jams through and the House concurs the same week.  Would raise probability sharply.  
6. Status-quo outcome: no Senate action before May; default is “No,” so a small nudge toward that outcome is prudent.

Probability: 11%
