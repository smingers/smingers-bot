**Evaluating Senate Legislation Timing**

I’m considering that there are only about two months left for Senate action. They’re busy with tariffs and other bills, which might overshadow the 2026 primaries. There's still a chance for legislation in February or March, but it’s a small bipartisan measure needing to pass through the Finance Committee. I'm thinking it could get attached to a more crucial bill, like aid for Taiwan, yet its chances seem low, around 10%. The political dynamics with Trump could shift things, but I'm unsure of Senate control.**Analyzing Senate Action Probability**

I'm weighing the chances of Senate action. If Republicans have a 51/49 majority, they still need 60 votes unless through reconciliation. The House passed it with a strong majority, which helps, but time is tight—only about two months left. Historical patterns show similar bills rarely pass quickly. I estimate about a 15% chance of Senate passage if it aligns with the House. If it does pass, the likelihood of presidential signing is almost certain. Attaching it to must-pass bills could elevate the probability to around 18%, which seems reasonable given all factors considered.**Considering Downward Factors**

I’m thinking about some factors that could lower our probability estimates. The Senate is currently busy with tariff refunds and other tax debates, which can overshadow this measure. Additionally, the Trump administration might prefer a larger tax package and potentially hold off until December for extenders. Overall, I'm estimating the probability of passage at about 12% now. I’ll make sure to craft a clear explanation with a checklist to help present this information effectively.
