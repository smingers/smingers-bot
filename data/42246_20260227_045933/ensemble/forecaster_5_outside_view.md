Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. The Tax Adviser article (Jun 2025) – Trade journal; factual on H.R. 10468, not H.R. 33.  Relevance: negligible.  
2. Greenback Tax Services blog (Jun 2025) – Commercial blog; mixes fact/opinion, no content on H.R. 33.  Relevance: negligible.  
3. Tax Fairness Abroad post (Jan 2026) – Advocacy blog; highlights tax-writing bottlenecks in 2025-26.  Factual claims about committee bandwidth seem plausible but are not sourced to primary data; treat with caution.  Moderate relevance (gives sense of legislative crowding‐out).  
4. BillTrack50 “118th Congress” article (2024) – Aggregated bill statistics from Congress.gov; descriptive statistics are reliable.  High relevance for base rates.  
5. Legislative Effectiveness Score article (CEL, 2023) – Peer-reviewed academic project; reliable but not specific to H.R. 33.  Low relevance.  
6. GovTrack “Legislative Statistics” (undated but current through 118th Congress) – Reputable data aggregation; tells when in the cycle bills usually pass.  High relevance.  
7. Senate Finance FAQ & history pages; Norton explainer – Purely procedural, no bearing on probability.  
8. Agent report (Feb 2026) – Collates Congress.gov searches on stand-alone foreign double-tax-relief bills since 2000; shows zero enactments.  Methodology described; easily verifiable.  High relevance.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
R1. “Any introduced bill” – Enactment rate ≈3–4 %.  Too broad.  
R2. “House-passed bills” – Enactment rate historically ≈20–25 %.  Removes obvious non-starters, but still includes commemoratives.  
R3. “House-passed stand-alone tax bills that are not part of a budget vehicle” – Scarcer; rough enactment rate ≈10 %.  Better fit to H.R. 33.  
R4. “Stand-alone bills providing bilateral double-tax relief since 2000” – Enactment rate 0 % (Agent report).  Very narrow but may understate probability if H.R. 33 is a first-of-its-kind success.

I select R3 as the main outside-view reference class: it balances similarity (tax-focused, not omnibus) with a meaningful sample size.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Days until cut-off: 64 (≈2.1 months).  
• GovTrack shows only ~25 % of eventual laws are enacted this early in the second session; most action clusters in the last quarter (Oct–Dec).  
• Therefore, conditional on ever passing, the chance it does so by May 1 is materially lower than the raw enactment rates above.  A rough temporal discount: 25 %/100 % ≈0.25.

(d) Justification  
Base rate from R3: ~10 % chance a House-passed stand-alone tax bill becomes law at any time in the two-year Congress.  
Temporal adjustment: multiply by 0.25 because only a quarter of successful bills clear before May 1 of the second year.  
=> 10 % × 0.25 = 2.5 %.  

Possible upward pressures (outside-view only):  
• Bipartisan interest in strengthening Taiwan ties (widely reported).  Historical evidence: security-oriented Taiwan legislation enjoys somewhat better odds than generic bills.  +1.5 pp  
Possible downward pressures:  
• Agent report shows no precedent for similar double-tax-relief bills passing since 2000.  –1 pp  
• Tax-writing bandwidth remains tight per Tax Fairness Abroad post.  –0.5 pp  

Net outside-view estimate ≈2.5 % + 1.5 – 1 – 0.5 = 2.5 %.

Outside view calibration:
• Round only to the nearest tenth of a percent to avoid false precision; retain moderate uncertainty.  
• Historical “upset” rate in legislative forecasts (bills thought dead that suddenly pass) is low but not zero; a 2–4 % band is typical for such long-shot legislation.  My 2.5 % sits inside that band and is consistent with the reference-class math above.

Outside View Prediction:
2.5 %
