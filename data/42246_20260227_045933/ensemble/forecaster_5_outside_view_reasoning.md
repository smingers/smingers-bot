**Analyzing Bill Probability**

I should consider the outside view analysis regarding whether H.R. 33 (United States–Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act) will be passed by May 1, 2026. Today is February 27, 2026, and there are about 64 days left. Instead of diving into current details, I'll focus on historical probabilities of bills passing in similar timeframes. It’s worth mentioning that the House has already passed it, which may slightly influence the overall probability of it succeeding, even though this is generally outside my analysis scope.**Estimating Bill Enactment Probability**

The outside view analysis could incorporate some information while still focusing on base rates. For example, I might refine categories like any bill, tax bill, or those that passed the House but not the Senate. Typically, after House passage, the probability of enactment is around 20%. I’ll summarize various sources on double-tax relief bills and evaluate their quality. Considering historical data, I might analyze certain reference classes to estimate the success rates for different types of bills within the given timeframe.**Estimating Bill Enactment Probability**

I need to estimate the probability of a bill that has passed the House by January being enacted by May, with it currently pending in the Senate. Based on typical paths, I think the probability might be around 10%, but data could be limited. Considering bipartisan support is uncertain, I could refine the outside view estimate to between 8% and 15%. Let’s work on crafting a thorough analysis to clarify these probabilities.
