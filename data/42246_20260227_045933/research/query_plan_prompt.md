You are a research planner for a forecasting question. Your task is to design a search strategy that gives forecasters the best possible evidence base.

QUESTION:
Will H.R. 33 (United States–Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act) be enacted into law before May 1, 2026?

Type: binary

Background:
Enactment would materially change the tax treatment of qualifying Taiwan residents’ U.S.-source income and would be a concrete signal of deepening U.S.–Taiwan economic alignment.

`{"format":"bot_tournament_question","info":{"hash_id":"83959a4628394b53","sheet_id":132.1}}`

Resolution criteria:
This question resolves Yes if, after the time the question opens and before May 1, 2026, Congress.gov shows H.R. 33 has become law (e.g., “Became Public Law No: …” or equivalent enacted status) on the bill’s official page: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/33](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/33). If Congress.gov does not show enacted/public-law status by the resolution time, the question resolves No.

Fine print:
“Enacted” requires becoming law and public-law designation, not merely House/Senate passage. If Congress.gov’s status is temporarily delayed, use the latest available Congress.gov status as of the resolution time; if still unclear, Candidate Sources are: GovInfo bill-to-law publications and public-law records ([https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/plaw](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/plaw)) and the “All Actions” tab for H.R. 33 on Congress.gov ([https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/33/all-actions](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/33/all-actions)).

PRE-RESEARCH CONTEXT:
The following information has already been gathered from sources referenced in the question. Use this to avoid redundant queries and to identify what additional research is needed.

No pre-research context available.



YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze the question and the pre-research context
2. Identify what information a skilled forecaster would need beyond what's already available
3. Generate 8 search queries to fill the remaining gaps

COVERAGE DIMENSIONS (ensure your queries collectively address these):
- Base rate: Historical frequency, distribution, or precedent for the outcome being forecast. How often has something like this happened before?
- Resolution mechanism: How exactly does this question resolve? What specific data source, metric, threshold, or event determines the outcome? What is the current state of that mechanism?
- Key drivers: The 1-3 most important causal factors that will determine the outcome. What moves this metric or makes this event more/less likely?
- Current state: Latest news, data points, or developments relevant to the question
- Contrarian check: Information that could support the less obvious outcome. What would make the unlikely scenario happen?

TYPE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
- For binary "will X reach Y by Z" questions: Include a query for the historical base rate of X reaching Y in comparable timeframes. Also query the current trajectory/trend.
- For numeric questions: Query for recent values of the metric AND its primary upstream drivers. For financial metrics, query for upcoming scheduled events (data releases, FOMC meetings, earnings) before the resolution date.
- For multiple choice questions: Ensure at least one query is relevant to each substantive option. For catch-all/"other" options, query for the base rate of non-favored outcomes.

AVAILABLE TOOLS (only use tools listed here):
- Google: Keyword search. Write short queries (max 6 words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages. Best for reference pages, datasets, official reports.
- Google News: Keyword search over recent news articles. Max 6 words. Best for breaking news, recent events, and current developments.
- Agent: Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. Write a detailed, multi-part query of up to 3 sentences. Best for complex questions needing synthesis across sources, base rate computation, or multi-factor analysis. IMPORTANT: Use exactly one Agent query, tagged [HISTORICAL], for base rate or reference class research. Do not use Agent for current events.
- AskNews: Semantic (meaning-based) news search. Write a descriptive 1-2 sentence natural language query focusing on the underlying topic, key actors, and context. Include relevant scope: geography, industry, time period. Avoid ambiguous acronyms. Best for finding conceptually related coverage even without exact keyword matches.
- FRED: Federal Reserve Economic Data. Use a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE", "CPIAUCSL") or a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate"). Returns historical data with computed statistics. Only use for economic/financial data.
- yFinance: Yahoo Finance ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "^GSPC"). Returns price history, fundamentals, analyst targets, and options data. Only use for stocks, indices, or ETFs.
- Google Trends: A search term (e.g., "hospital"). Returns 90-day search interest data with base rate analysis. Only use when the question specifically involves Google Trends data.

TAG each query as [HISTORICAL] (for base rates, reference classes, past data, background context) or [CURRENT] (for recent news, latest values, current developments, upcoming events). Aim for roughly 60% historical and 40% current. Include at least 2 of each.

Format your answer exactly as below. Each query on its own line. The source in parentheses, temporal tag in brackets. Do not wrap queries in quotes.

Analysis:
{Your analysis of the question, what the pre-research context already provides, what key information gaps remain, and your search strategy.}
