This rule targets 'property hoarders'\u2014those owning three or more self-occupied homes\u2014allowing local governments to set stricter differential tax rates. The revised policy will take effect starting the 2027 property tax filing season. The move aims to prevent public safety risks from unauthorized conversions. Meanwhile, NVIDIA reported its Q4 fiscal year 2026 revenue at $68.13 billion, a 73% year-on-year increase, surpassing the market expectation of $66.21 billion. Data center revenue rose 75% year-on-year to $62.3 billion, with net profit doubling to approximately $43 billion and a gross margin of 75%. Foxconn announced its 2025 financial results, achieving record revenue of NT$2.12 trillion (a 50.5% increase), net profit of NT$75 billion, and EPS of NT$19.45. The company expects AI server revenue to grow by triple digits in 2026, accounting for 80% of total server revenue, with capital expenditures estimated at NT$30 billion. SK Hynix and SanDisk launched the High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) standardization alliance in California on February 25, 2026, to promote global standardization of next-generation memory solutions for AI inference. TrendForce forecasts a 90%\u201395% increase in traditional DRAM contract prices in Q1 2026, with an overall rise of 80%\u201385% including HBM, driven by strong supply demand and continued pricing power favoring original equipment manufacturers despite seasonal softness in consumer demand.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 27, 2026 12:29 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20260227000944-260410)\n\n**Parking Spaces Converted to Homes Face Higher Speculation Tax**\nTaiwan's Ministry of Finance announced a proposed amendment on February 26, 2026, targeting property owners who illegally convert parking spaces or emergency shelter areas into residential units. Under the revised rules, local governments will be authorized to impose stricter differentiated tax rates on such properties, with a maximum tax rate of 4.8% for individuals holding three or more residential properties nationwide (i.e., 'speculators'). The change applies to properties where the use has been altered without official approval from the building permit, even if the original use was parking or emergency shelter. For example, if a property owner in a city with stricter local regulations (e.g., Taipei) converts a parking space into a residence, that unit could be taxed at the highest rate of 4.8%, even if the rest of their properties fall under a lower rate. In a particularly severe case, a single non-primary residence converted from an emergency shelter could trigger a tax rate increase from 2% to 4.8%, effectively doubling the tax burden. The amendment will take effect starting July 1, 2026, meaning the 2027 property tax filing will be subject to the new rules. The Ministry emphasized that retroactive application will not occur, and non-speculators or those with only one primary residence are unaffected. The two main revisions include expanding the definition of 'other reasonable needs' to allow local authorities to set higher rates for unauthorized use changes and clarifying the implementation date. The measure aims to strengthen local autonomy while ensuring public safety and proper land use.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 08:10 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20260227000159-260202)\n\n**Taiwan's Stock Market Soars While Livelihoods Struggle: 'Gu\u01cenzh\u01ceng' Warns of Economic Imbalance Impacting DPP's Election Prospects**\nTaiwan's stock market has surged, reaching new highs and surpassing the 30,000-point mark, yet many residents feel no economic recovery. Taiwanese internet celebrity 'Gu\u01cenzh\u01ceng' (Chen Zhihan) stated in a live broadcast that inflation is severe, with prices rising across the board\u2014such as eggs in breakfast shops costing 20 New Taiwan Dollars, and meals, fast food, and desserts all increasing in price. Despite the stock market gains, consumer spending has declined, with e-commerce sales during 'Double 11' and 'Double 12' promotions falling short of previous years. As a fitness industry professional, 'Gu\u01cenzh\u01ceng' noted that non-essential spending, such as gym memberships, has been hit hardest, with businesses unable to raise prices and instead engaging in price-cutting competition. He warned that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is deeply concerned about the impact on its political prospects in the 2026 'Nine-in-One' local elections and the 2028 Taiwan regional election, as rising living costs without corresponding income growth are creating tangible hardships for ordinary citizens. His comments resonated widely online, with many netizens expressing agreement, including one who said they had reduced their meals from three to two per day due to inflation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 12:57 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8r43rcI99WT)\n\n**Taiwan at the Center of Global Tensions: The 2027 Scenario Terrifies Silicon Valley**\nThe possibility of a conflict over Taiwan has moved beyond geopolitical analysis and now deeply concerns executives at major U.S. technology companies. Taiwan is the global hub for advanced semiconductor production, supplying approximately 90% of the world\u2019s most advanced chips, which are essential for smartphones, data centers, artificial intelligence, and military systems. According to reports from the American press, in summer 2023 U.S. intelligence leaders briefed a select group of Silicon Valley executives\u2014representatives from leading chip and consumer electronics firms\u2014on the most critical scenarios related to China\u2019s military plans. The Chinese government considers Taiwan part of its territory since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, while Taiwan functions as a self-governing, democratic entity with strong economic ties to the United States. Tensions have escalated in recent years, especially due to statements suggesting China\u2019s military could be ready for a potential operation by 2027. A sudden disruption in semiconductor supply from Taiwan would trigger immediate global economic consequences, with estimates suggesting a double-digit contraction in the U.S. GDP and trillions in global losses. In response, the U.S. has accelerated domestic semiconductor production through the CHIPS and Science Act, allocating tens of billions of dollars to incentivize new manufacturing plants. Major companies have announced significant investments in the U.S., though shifting advanced chip production away from Taiwan remains a slow and costly process requiring time, infrastructure, and skilled labor. Meanwhile, Taipei maintains a strategy of keeping advanced technologies on the island\u2014a so-called 'silicon shield'\u2014to deter military action by making Taiwan economically indispensable. However, economic interdependence has not proven a sufficient deterrent in past conflicts, prompting U.S. tech firms to closely monitor developments in Asia, as the future of the global digital industry hangs in the balance.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 10:33 AM\nSource:[Tecnoandroid](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2026/02/26/taiwan-al-centro-delle-tensioni-globali-lipotesi-2027-agita-la-silicon-valley-1783894/)\n\n**The New York Times Reveals 3-Year-Old Classified Briefing: Zhang Yanting Exposes U.S. 'Dual Transfer' Strategy on Taiwan**\nThe New York Times revealed on February 24, 2026, that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) conducted a highly classified briefing in July 2023 for tech leaders including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The briefing warned that Beijing might act against Taiwan by around 2027 and highlighted that a disruption in Taiwan\u2019s chip supply could trigger the most severe global economic shock since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Former Air Force Deputy Commander Zhang Yanting stated that the U.S. strategy to address the semiconductor crisis is a 'dual transfer': first, relocating 40% of Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor production capacity to the U.S. to anchor technology, talent, and capital within American borders; second, increasing U.S. military sales to Taiwan, with estimated total economic impact of $1 trillion USD (NT$3.1 trillion) when factoring in maintenance, logistics, and long-term support\u20142.5 times the initial $40 billion purchase. Zhang argued this dual transfer undermines Taiwan\u2019s strategic importance while securing U.S. semiconductor and financial interests, calling it a 'double hollowing out' of Taiwan. He warned that future U.S. investments could reach $500 billion more, totaling NT$15.1 trillion, and questioned: 'After the U.S. solves its semiconductor and financial challenges, what will Taiwan do?' The article also references a claim by the New York Times that former President Trump told Huang that discussing Taiwan makes Xi Jinping 'breathe rapidly,' highlighting U.S. pressure tactics. The report was published on February 26, 2026, by China Times Online.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 06:32 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20260226002701-260407)\n\n**Iowa Legislature Passes Pro-Taiwan Resolution, Advocates for Tax Treaty and Enhanced U.S.-Taiwan Ties**\nThe Iowa State Legislature passed a resolution in support of Taiwan on February 26, 2026, affirming opposition to China's distortion of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 to block Taiwan's international participation and advocating for the early completion of a U.S.-Taiwan tax treaty to promote investment cooperation. The resolution follows similar actions by Indiana's legislature and highlights Taiwan's 'three-chain strategy'\u2014'comprehensive diplomacy,' 'value-based diplomacy,' and 'alliance diplomacy'\u2014including support for building a 'global democratic value chain,' 'Indo-Pacific first island chain,' and 'non-red supply chain.' The resolution commends Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung and reaffirms support for the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. 'Taiwan' naming policy, and Taiwan's international participation. It also recognizes Taiwan's self-defense efforts and underscores shared democratic values between the U.S. and Taiwan, particularly in light of the 250th anniversary of American independence and Taiwan's 30th anniversary of direct presidential elections. Taipei Economic and Cultural Office Representative Lai Yan-feng, who addressed the legislature, emphasized growing agricultural ties, a planned $10 billion (approximately NT$312.6 billion) U.S. agricultural procurement by Taiwanese companies over four years, and the strengthening of economic and security cooperation, including the signing of the 'Silicon Valley Declaration' and the 'U.S.-Taiwan Economic Security Cooperation Joint Statement' during the sixth U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue.

This prompted Trump to urge Huang to promote chip manufacturing in the United States. The article highlights growing U.S. concerns over dependence on Taiwan's semiconductor industry, especially as artificial intelligence becomes a key economic driver. A classified report commissioned under the Biden administration in 2022 warned that a disruption in Taiwan's chip supply could trigger the worst global economic shock since the Great Depression, with U.S. GDP potentially declining by 11%\u2014double the impact of the 2008 financial crisis\u2014and China\u2019s GDP falling by up to 16%. To reduce reliance, the Biden administration passed the CHIPS and Science Act, allocating over $50 billion in subsidies to attract semiconductor investments, including from TSMC. However, higher production costs and technological gaps in the U.S. have limited customer demand for American-made chips. After Trump returned to the White House, he used tariffs as leverage, threatening to impose a 32% tariff on goods from Taiwan, with semiconductor products subject to separate rates. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pressured Taiwan to increase investment in U.S. chip manufacturing, offering tariff exemptions in exchange. Initially resistant, Taiwan\u2019s government and TSMC eventually agreed to expand investment, including purchasing land in Phoenix, Arizona, for at least five new factories. Taiwan\u2019s government also pledged $250 billion in credit guarantees to support U.S. investments. The goal, according to Lutnick, was to shift approximately 40% of Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor production capacity to the U.S.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 12:15 AM\nSource:[Liberty Times Net](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/5351737)\n\n**Taiwan\u2019s Chip Dominance and the Looming Economic Apocalypse: U.S. Push for Semiconductor Relocation**\nThe article examines the growing dependence of the United States on Taiwan for high-end semiconductor manufacturing, with Taiwan producing 90% of the world\u2019s advanced chips. U.S. officials, including Presidents Biden and Trump, have repeatedly urged the tech industry to shift production to the U.S., citing national security and economic risks. A 2022 confidential report commissioned by the Semiconductor Industry Association warned that a blockade or invasion of Taiwan could trigger an economic 'apocalypse,' causing a 11% collapse in U.S. GDP\u2014double the impact of the 2008 recession. Despite $50 billion in subsidies from the CHIPS Act, U.S. companies have been reluctant to shift production due to higher costs (25% more expensive) and inferior technology compared to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). In 2023, intelligence briefings by CIA and NSA officials failed to prompt significant change. However, in late 2024, under Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, a new strategy emerged: pressuring TSMC to expand U.S. operations by offering incentives and threatening tariffs. TSMC responded by increasing its U.S. investment to $100 billion and building four new plants by 2028. Trump\u2019s administration intensified pressure, imposing a 32% tariff on Taiwanese chips and demanding that Intel cede 10% of its business to the U.S. government in exchange for funding. This deal, based on questionable legal grounds, allowed Intel to secure $8.9 billion in CHIPS Act funds. Subsequently, Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm committed to increased U.S. investment, with Apple pledging $100 billion. Lutnick\u2019s ultimate goal is for 40% of Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor production to be relocated to the U.S., with a proposed 50% domestic procurement mandate and a 100% tariff on non-compliant firms. The article warns that failure to act could lead to a global economic crisis, with a single disruption in Taiwan\u2019s supply chain causing trillions in losses.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 06:00 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/economia/2026/02/25/los-chips-de-taiwan-y-la-amenaza-de-un-apocalipsis-economico/)\n\n**Taiwan's Defense Minister Urges Legislative Yuan to Authorize Early Signing of 3 U.S. Military Procurement Deals Before Expiry**\nTaiwan's Defense Minister Koo Li-hsiung stated on February 24, 2026, that three U.S. defense procurement offer letters\u2014covering Javelin missiles, Stinger Block 2B missiles, and the advanced M109A7 self-propelled howitzer\u2014will expire on March 15, 2026. Due to concerns that the budget process may not be completed in time, he urged the Legislative Yuan to authorize the Ministry of National Defense to sign the agreements before the budget is approved. The Ministry emphasized that the procurement plans were the result of over a year of rigorous analysis and consultations with the U.S. executive branch, including the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense, and that the U.S. has expressed support for the NT$1.25 trillion (approximately USD 0.04 trillion) 8-year 'Enhancement of Defense Resilience and Asymmetric Capabilities Procurement Special Act' draft. The draft was submitted to the Legislative Yuan after being passed by the Executive Yuan in late 2025 but has been repeatedly blocked by the Kuomintang and Taiwan People's Party factions. Defense Minister Koo stressed that delaying the signing could disrupt military capability development. Taiwan lawmakers Wang Ding-yu and Chen Kuan-ting echoed this concern, noting that missing the deadline could lead to price increases, delivery delays, or even cancellation of the deals. Wang cited precedents, such as the 2024 CDCM (land-based Harpoon) case and the 'Feng Lei Project,' where the Defense Committee authorized signing before budget approval, successfully avoiding delays. Chen emphasized that timely procurement is essential for national defense, deterrence, and regional stability, urging the Legislative Yuan to act responsibly and expedite the process to prevent irreversible damage to Taiwan's defense readiness.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 10:54 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/26/2/25/n14705748.htm)\n\n**CFAIC Urges Legislative Yuan to Expedite Budget Review and ART Trade Agreement Amid Global Uncertainty**\nThe All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (CFAIC), led by Chairman Pan Junrong, held a Lunar New Year exchange with Legislative Yuan Speaker Han Kuo-yu on February 24, 2026, urging all sectors to act as a 'stabilizing force' amid global upheaval and calling for unity between the executive and legislative branches to create a new era in Taiwan's economic and trade development. Pan and the CFAIC's board members bowed to the Kuomintang (KMT) caucus to request support for industrial development budgets. The CFAIC emphasized that Taiwan is at a critical juncture due to rapid global geopolitical shifts, particularly the unpredictable policies of the U.S. Trump administration, which have created high economic uncertainty. Businesses fear uncertainty more than competition or change, and stable social and economic development is the nation's most important foundation. The CFAIC issued two key appeals: first, to urge the Legislative Yuan to expedite the review of the national budget, as delays could disrupt the momentum for industrial upgrading and harm the economy, especially given that the budget funds core initiatives like the 'AI New Ten Major Projects' for the next 20 years; second, to call on the Legislative Yuan to swiftly review the 'Taiwan-U.S. Reciprocal Trade Agreement' (ART) with bipartisan support, prioritizing national long-term competitiveness. The CFAIC stressed the need for national unity, likening Taiwan to a ship where all must row together, and highlighted that despite limited natural resources, Taiwan\u2019s industrial sector has driven the stock market to 34,700 points after a strong start to the Lunar New Year. The organization reiterated its commitment to serving as a bridge between industry and government, urging both branches to act swiftly to pass the budget and advance the ART, not only for current orders but to secure Taiwan\u2019s strategic role in the global supply chain over the next two decades.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 02:11 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx)\n\n**Taiwan Faces U.S. Tariff Shifts, Market Gains, and Global Cultural Echoes**\nThe U.S. has implemented tariffs under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, imposing a 15% tariff on all trading partners,\u53e0\u52a0 Most Favored Nation (MFN) rates, with potential future use of Section 232 and Section 301. Taiwan's Deputy Premier Zheng Lijun stated that Section 122 impacts Taiwan but does not affect the semiconductor-related benefits under the Section 232 provision of the U.S.-Taiwan Investment Cooperation Memorandum. Economic Minister Gong Mingxin noted that industries such as chemicals, construction materials, textiles, transportation, and machinery face greater impacts, though overall industrial conditions are expected to be better than in 2025. Agriculture Minister Chen Junji said Taiwan will continue to seek to maintain its existing trade benefits under the U.S.-Taiwan Equitable Trade Agreement. National Development Council Chairperson Ye Junxian affirmed that Taiwan\u2019s economy remains resilient despite tariff changes. The Taiwan stock market index reached record highs for four consecutive trading days, closing at 34,700.82 points on February 24, 2026, with a single-day gain of 927.56 points, the second-largest in history. Analysts attribute the surge to international capital seeking safe havens, citing Taiwan\u2019s tax and industrial advantages. A survey found that 48% of respondents expect the 2026 U.S.-Taiwan tariff agreement to have a positive impact on both GDP and the stock market.

In the Legislative Yuan, the National Defense Special Act and related bills were referred to the Foreign Affairs and Defense and Finance Committees for joint review. Defense Minister Ku Li-hung expressed concern over three military procurement contracts expiring on March 15, urging the legislature to grant early authorization to avoid delays. Speaker Han Kuo-yu warned of potential political risks if the military procurement bill is mishandled. No consensus was reached on President Lai Qingde\u2019s state-of-the-nation address, which will be rescheduled. The war in Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, has caused tens of thousands of deaths and displaced millions, becoming the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy stated that Putin\u2019s goal of occupying Ukraine failed. Taiwan and Western democracies have consistently supported Ukraine through humanitarian aid and volunteer contributions, including Taiwanese and Hong Kong volunteers joining international forces. The Panama Canal, long controlled by China-linked firms, underwent a major shift under Trump\u2019s second presidency. Panama\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that a contract held by CK Hutchison\u2019s subsidiary in Panama was unconstitutional and void, leading to government takeover of the port operations. CK Hutchison rejected the move, asserting its right to pursue legal action. Hong Kong authorities formally protested, vowing to defend Hong Kong businesses abroad, while China\u2019s Foreign Ministry stated it would safeguard enterprises\u2019 legitimate rights. To prevent identity theft and ghost package fraud, Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Finance implemented a 'pre-confirmation of appointment' system starting March 1, 2026, requiring online verification of personal imports via the EZ Way app. A Taiwanese fire dancer, Yang Liwei, gained international fame on 'Britain\u2019s Got Talent' with a stunning flame performance, including extinguishing fire in her mouth and spinning a burning barrel with her feet, stating, 'I represent Taiwan\u2019s most beautiful and powerful flame.'

Regarding the U.S. 'reciprocal trade agreement,' the government will 'monitor developments,' 'ensure outcomes,' and 'respond prudently,' noting that the U.S. has stated Section 232 will not be affected, though the investigation will continue and Section 301 will be expanded. The government will assess negotiations carefully, maintain close coordination with the U.S., and safeguard the existing most-favored-nation treatment under Section 232 to preserve competitive advantages. Economic achievements include a GDP growth rate of 8.63% in 2025, exports reaching $640.75 billion (a record high), and the private sector's total assets in banking, insurance, and securities surpassing NT$13.3 trillion\u2014up nearly 70% over the past decade. The Asia Asset Management Center's managed assets reached NT$36.51 trillion by November 2025, exceeding the original two-year target of adding NT$4 trillion. The 'Trillion-Dollar National Development Investment Program' has directed NT$337.2 billion into national infrastructure, a 112% increase from 2024. The government also plans to expand digital transformation initiatives into smart manufacturing, smart business services, and smart agriculture, building on the successful rollout of 551 smart dining and healthcare sites in 2025. The National Development Fund will continue its 13th round of overseas investment financing loans with a doubled quota from NT$300 billion to NT$600 billion. Additionally, the 'Advanced Semiconductor R&D Hub' in Hsinchu Science Park officially broke ground in February 2026, becoming Taiwan\u2019s first new-type high-tech semiconductor facility with a 12-inch prototype production line, designed to lower verification barriers for startups and small IC design firms and accelerate technology commercialization.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 04:23 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5613/9341216)\n\n**Zheng Lijun: Postponing U.S. Trade Talks Risks Are Rising**\nTaiwan's Vice Premier Zheng Lijun stated on February 24, 2026, that the risk of future trade negotiations with the United States is increasing, following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose global tariffs was invalid. Despite this, the U.S. government has announced a new executive order under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, imposing a 15% temporary tariff on top of existing Most Favored Nation (MFN) rates, effective from U.S. Eastern Time at 12:00 a.m. (Taiwan time at 1:00 p.m.). Zheng noted that while the initial public notice listed a 10% rate, the rate was raised to 15% within 24 hours, prompting Taiwan\u2019s government to assess impacts based on the 15% figure. The U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Grayer, also announced that the U.S. may initiate Section 301 trade investigations against countries, with tariffs determined by findings. Zheng emphasized that the U.S. is shifting from IEEPA to alternative legal mechanisms\u2014such as Section 122, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930\u2014to maintain its tariff objectives. She warned that Taiwan faces heightened negotiation risks due to its status as the sixth-largest U.S. trade deficit country in 2024, with the deficit projected to double to $150 billion in 2025. Despite these challenges, Taiwan has secured two key advantages in two negotiation rounds: a 15% non-cumulative tariff benefit and protection from changes to Section 232 MFN treatment, which she described as a strong foundation for maintaining favorable treatment amid future U.S. tariff policy shifts.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 02:52 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20260224001467-260407)\n\n**U.S. Congressman Judy Chu Praises Closest U.S.-Taiwan Ties Ever, Seeks Bipartisan Support for Double Taxation Relief Bill**\nU.S. Representative Judy Chu (\u8d99\u7f8e\u5fc3) stated that U.S.-Taiwan economic and trade relations have never been closer, emphasizing that the 'United States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act' passed the U.S. House of Representatives with 423 votes in favor and only 1 opposed, reflecting strong bipartisan support.

He emphasized pushing for the 'U.S.-Taiwan Rapid Double Taxation Relief Act,' which has been under negotiation for 20 years, noting Taiwan is the only major trading partner yet to sign the agreement. Yu stated that the momentum is now increasing toward success. He highlighted that the U.S. President Donald Trump signed the 'Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act,' requiring the State Department to regularly review and update guidelines on U.S.-Taiwan relations. As Taiwan\u2019s investment in the U.S. continues to grow, the necessity of the double taxation relief is rising. Yu clarified that the focus is on enabling Taiwan\u2019s experience and business models to take root in the U.S., not relocating entire industries, aiming for a win-win outcome. He noted that 40% of Taiwan\u2019s foreign direct investment (FDI) flowed to the U.S. last year, with expectations of further growth. The Phoenix route launch by China Airlines reflects the ripple effect of TSMC\u2019s presence, with more industries expected to follow. Regarding the legislative timeline, the bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives earlier in the year and now awaits Senate approval. With the 2026 midterm elections approaching and Senate elections scheduled, Yu stressed the urgency to pass the bill before the political reset, noting that increasing cross-border investments from both sides create mutual benefits. Upon passage, Taiwanese firms investing in the U.S. would avoid double taxation on employees\u2019 income already taxed in Taiwan, and Taiwanese residents in the U.S. would benefit from lower withholding tax rates on U.S.-sourced income, delivering tangible advantages to businesses and individuals on both sides.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 12:10 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E6%9B%9D%E5%8F%B0%E7%BE%8E%E9%97%9C%E7%A8%85%E8%AB%87%E5%88%A4%E9%80%B2%E5%BA%A6-%E4%BF%9E%E5%A4%A7%E3%B5%A2%E7%A8%B1%E5%BF%AB%E4%BA%86-%E9%9B%99%E9%87%8D%E8%AA%B2%E7%A8%85%E6%B8%9B%E5%85%8D%E6%98%8E%E5%B9%B4%E6%8B%9A%E9%81%8E%E9%97%9C-121006239.html)\n\n**Taiwan and U.S. Aim to Avoid Double Taxation; Yu Ta-wei Hopes for Passage by 2026**\nTaiwan's representative to the United States, Yu Ta-wei, stated that Taiwan has been actively negotiating with the U.S. to avoid double taxation, a move beneficial to both Taiwanese and American businesses.

The search results focused primarily on broader geopolitical tensions, tariff policies, and diplomatic developments rather than specific tax legislation between the U.S. and Taiwan.\n\nHowever, the available information provides important context regarding the current state of U.S.-Taiwan economic relations that would likely affect any double-tax relief legislation:\n\n**Current Trade Environment:**\nAs of February 2026, Taiwan is subject to the Trump administration's global tariff regime. Following a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated broader emergency tariff powers, President Trump imposed a 10% global tariff (later raised to 15%) effective February 24, 2026, with a 150-day expiration period [12][13]. These tariffs apply to countries with trade agreements with the U.S., including Taiwan [12], creating a challenging environment for bilateral tax relief negotiations.\n\n**Support for U.S.-Taiwan Trade Relations:**\nDespite tariff tensions, there remains strong subnational support for U.S.-Taiwan trade cooperation. On February 25, 2026, the Indiana State Legislature passed a bipartisan resolution reaffirming support for Taiwan-Indiana sister-state relations and the Taiwan Relations Act. The resolution specifically emphasized that \"robust U.S.-Taiwan trade negotiations are vital for strengthening bilateral trade\" and encouraged Indiana businesses to engage economically with Taiwan [2].\n\n**Geopolitical Complications:**\nThe upcoming March 31-April 2, 2026 summit between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing may significantly impact prospects for U.S.-Taiwan tax cooperation. Chinese officials have reportedly viewed recent U.S. legal setbacks on tariffs as weakening Trump's negotiating position [16], and Beijing continues to pressure Washington on Taiwan-related issues, including U.S. arms sales to the island [16][17]. Xi has reportedly sought reduced U.S. support for Taiwan as part of broader trade negotiations [15].\n\n**Legislative Context:**\nWhile the search did not yield information about the specific Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act, the Indiana resolution [2] demonstrates ongoing legislative interest in strengthening U.S.-Taiwan economic ties through the Taiwan Relations Act and Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act frameworks.\n\n**Limitations:**\nWithout specific reporting on the \"United States\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act\" itself, I cannot provide definitive prospects for its passage or implementation in 2026. The act may be in early legislative stages, pending in committee, or affected by the current focus on tariff negotiations and the upcoming Trump-Xi summit. Additional targeted searches of congressional legislative databases or tax policy sources would be necessary to provide a complete assessment of this specific bill's prospects.\n</Asknews_articles>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/14/ap-tax-hike-professional-gamblers/\">\n## Summary: Republicans Block Attempt to Roll Back Gambling Tax Provision\n\n**Source:** CT Mirror / Associated Press | **Date:** July 14, 2025\n\n### Core Issue\nSenate Republicans blocked a Democratic attempt to reverse a provision in the recently signed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" that changes how professional gamblers can deduct losses on their taxes.\n\n### Key Facts\n- **The change:** Starting in 2026, gamblers can only deduct **90% of gambling losses** (up to winnings), down from the previous **100%** deduction allowance\n- **Practical impact example:** Someone winning and losing $100,000 would now owe taxes on $10,000 despite breaking even\n- **Revenue estimate:** The provision is projected to generate **over $1.1 billion in tax revenue over eight years**\n- **Overall bill deficit impact:** The broader law will increase the deficit by **~$3.3 trillion from 2025\u20132034** (per CBO)\n\n### Political Dynamics\n- Democratic Sen.
