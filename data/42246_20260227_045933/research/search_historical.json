The content has minimal direct relevance to the forecasting question, though it touches on the broader landscape of U.S. international tax reform legislation.\n\n---\n\n### Key Points from the Article:\n\n**The Bill (H.R. 10468):**\n- Introduced December 18, 2024, by Rep. Darin La Hood (R-IL)\n- Would shift the U.S. from **citizenship-based taxation** to **residence-based taxation** for Americans living abroad\n- Qualifying U.S. citizens abroad could elect to be treated as nonresidents for tax purposes **without renouncing citizenship**\n\n**Legislative Context:**\n- Several predecessor bills (2018, 2021, 2023) on similar themes **none were enacted**\n- The issue gained urgency after Trump's October 2024 campaign pledge to end double taxation on overseas citizens\n\n**Key Proposed Provisions:**\n- Election to be treated as a nonresident (subject to conditions)\n- Exemption from FBAR, Form 8938, Form 5471 reporting requirements\n- FATCA relief via certificates of nonresidency\n- A new **mark-to-market departure tax** for high-net-worth electing individuals\n- Treaty saving clause waivers for electing individuals\n\n**Relevance to H.R. 33:** Essentially none \u2014 this article addresses a separate, broader tax reform bill unrelated to U.S.\u2013Taiwan tax relief specifically.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/blog/trump-proposal-end-double-taxation/\">\n## Summary: Trump's Double Taxation Proposal for US Expats (Greenback Expat Tax Services, June 27, 2025)\n\n**Note:** This article is from a tax services company (Greenback Expat Tax Services) with a commercial interest in expat tax filing. It should be treated as a less authoritative source on legislative specifics.\n\n### Key Facts & Context\n- Approximately **4.4 million Americans live abroad** and are subject to US tax filing requirements regardless of where they live or earn income.\n- Current law already provides significant relief: the **Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)** allows exclusion of up to **$130,000 in 2025**, and the **Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)** offers dollar-for-dollar relief for foreign taxes paid \u2014 meaning most expats already owe little to nothing.\n\n### Legislative/Policy Developments\n- During his **October 2024 campaign**, Trump expressed support for eliminating double taxation for Americans abroad by shifting to a **residence-based tax system**.\n- The proposal has **bipartisan interest**, with Democrats Abroad also supporting the shift.\n- **Representative La Hood** has introduced legislation in Congress to implement residence-based taxation for Americans abroad.\n\n### Relevance to H.R. 33\n- This article does **not mention H.R. 33 or the US\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act** specifically. It focuses on double taxation relief for **US citizens living abroad broadly**, not the Taiwan-specific bilateral tax relief bill.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.taxfairnessabroad.org/blog/2026-the-year-to-end-the-double-taxation-of-americans-abroadnbsp\">\n## Summary: \"2026 \u2014 The Year to End the Double Taxation of Americans Abroad\"\n**Source:** Tax Fairness For Americans Abroad | **Date:** January 5, 2026 | **Author:** Brandon Mitchener\n\n---\n\n### Key Context\nThis article is focused on the **Residence-Based Taxation for Americans Abroad Act** (sponsored by Rep. Darin La Hood and Sen. Todd Young), **not H.R. 33 (the U.S.\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act)**. The article's relevance to the question is limited but provides useful contextual information about Congressional tax-writing bandwidth and legislative timelines.\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Facts & Observations\n\n**Congressional Bandwidth Constraints:**\n- Congress spent the **first half of 2025** consumed by reconciliation bill negotiations, which \"sucked up all the tax-writing committees' and JCT's bandwidth\"\n- Later in 2025, **healthcare coverage debates** again occupied key tax-policy staff\n- These competing priorities are explicitly cited as reasons why tax legislation moved slowly in 2025\n\n**Legislative Process Observations:**\n- The **Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)** must score significant tax bills, a process described as time-consuming and technically demanding\n- Bipartisan support is identified as critical for tax legislation to advance through Congress\n\n**General Legislative Outlook for 2026:**\n- The article signals that major tax legislation remains in early/mid stages of development as of January 2026, with reintroduction of the La Hood bill expected \"as early as possible in the new year\"\n\n---\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis article does not directly reference H.R. 33 (the U.S.\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act) and should be treated as only **indirectly relevant** to the forecasting question, primarily as evidence of Congressional tax-legislative capacity constraints.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.billtrack50.com/info/blog/the-118th-congress-a-study-in-legislative-theater\">\n## Summary: \"The 118th Congress: A Study in Legislative Theater\" (BillTrack50)\n\n### Key Facts & Statistics\n\n- The **118th Congress (2023\u20132024)** passed **636 bills out of 19,316 introduced**, a success rate of just **3.3%**\n- For comparison:\n  - 117th Congress (2021\u20132022): **742 bills** passed\n  - 116th Congress (2019\u20132020): **344 bills** (COVID-impacted)\n  - 115th Congress (2017\u20132018): **788 bills**\n  - 106th Congress (1999\u20132000): **1,215 bills**\n  - 91st Congress (1969\u20131970): **3,047 bills**\n- Of the 636 enacted pieces of legislation, **431 were merely resolutions**, including only **17 joint resolutions**\n- President Biden **vetoed 12 of those joint resolutions**, leaving only **5 standing**\n- **95 bills** designated various \"national days\"; **73** designated \"national months\"; **30** renamed post offices\n- Ceremonial designations made up **over a quarter** of all enacted legislation\n\n### Context & Tone\n- The article characterizes the 118th Congress as among the **least productive in modern history**, marked by political drama including the **ousting of Speaker Kevin McCarthy** and subsequent leadership struggles before **Mike Johnson** was chosen\n- The article is notably **editorial in tone**, describing the session as \"legislative theater\" and \"institutional paralysis\"\n\n### Relevance to H.R. 33 Question\nThis article does **not mention H.R. 33 or the U.S.\u2013Taiwan tax relief bill specifically**. However, it provides useful **base-rate context**: the 118th Congress's extremely low bill passage rate (3.3%) underscores the general difficulty of moving legislation through Congress, a dynamic likely to persist into the 119th Congress.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://thelawmakers.org/legislative-effectiveness-scores/highlights-from-the-new-117th-congress-legislative-effectiveness-scores\">\n## Summary\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is entirely unrelated to H.R. 33 (United States\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act) or U.S.-Taiwan tax policy. It is a report from the **Center for Effective Lawmaking (CEL)**, authored by Craig Volden and Alan Wiseman, announcing the release of **Legislative Effectiveness Scores (LES) for the 117th Congress (2021\u201323)**. No information relevant to the forecasting question is contained within it.\n\n---\n\n### Article Content (for completeness):\n\nThe CEL releases LES scores based on 15 metrics tracking bill sponsorship, legislative progress, and policy substance, normalized to an average of 1.0. Key findings for the **117th House Democrats** include:\n\n- **Rep. Gerald Connolly (VA)** ranked #1, with an LES ~7x the House average; sponsored 51 bills, 3 became standalone law.\n- **Rep. Carolyn Maloney (NY)** ranked #2; sponsored 92 bills, 2 became law, including the *Postal Service Reform Act of 2022*.\n- **Rep. Joe Neguse (CO)** ranked #3; 89 bills introduced, 3 became law.\n- **Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT)** ranked #4; navigated 5 appropriations measures into law.\n- **Rep. Jason Crow (CO)** ranked #5.\n\nNotably, committee chairs averaged only **1.1 laws per chair** \u2014 the lowest rate since 1973.\n\n**This article contains no information relevant to H.R. 33 or U.S.-Taiwan tax legislation.**\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/statistics\">\n## Summary of GovTrack.us Legislative Statistics Article\n\n**Note:** This article provides general congressional statistics and does not contain specific information about H.R. 33 (United States\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act).\n\n### Key Facts from the Article:\n\n**Legislative Output:**\n- Since World War II, Congress has typically enacted **4\u20136 million words of new law** per two-year congressional session\n- The overall **number of bills enacted has decreased** over time, but this does not mean less legislative work is occurring \u2014 bills have become fewer but larger\n\n**Timing of Legislative Activity:**\n- Bills and resolutions tend to be **introduced early** in a congressional session\n- Approximately **half of all legislation that will be enacted** in a given session is enacted only in the **final quarter** of that session\n- By the midpoint of a session (end of December, Year 1), only about **one-third (33%)** of bills that will ultimately be enacted have been enacted \u2014 meaning the session is half over in time but only one-third complete in terms of enacted legislation\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting:\nThese historical patterns suggest that enactment of any given bill is statistically more likely toward the **end of a congressional session**, and that early-session passage is relatively uncommon. This context could inform base-rate expectations for H.R. 33's prospects before May 1, 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/about/faq\">\n## Summary\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article contains no information directly relevant to H.R. 33 (United States\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act) or its legislative progress.

It also played a central role in the contentious battle over the **Second Bank of the United States** and President Jackson's censure.\n- **Civil War (1861\u20131865):** The Committee was pivotal in war financing, including shaping the nation's **first income tax** and addressing currency crises.\n\n---\n\n**This article provides no useful information for forecasting the enactment of H.R. 33.**\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"http://norton.house.gov/how-a-bill-becomes-a-law\">\n## Summary: How a Bill Becomes a Law (Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, August 25, 2014)\n\n**Note:** This article is a general civics explainer about the U.S. legislative process and contains **no information specific to H.R. 33 or the United States\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act.**\n\n---\n\n### Key Stages of the Legislative Process:\n\n1. **Introduction:** Any member of Congress may introduce a bill; it is assigned a number, labeled with the sponsor's name, and referred to the appropriate committee.\n\n2. **Committee Stage:** The bill is placed on the committee calendar, may be assigned to a subcommittee, hearings may be held, and the full committee votes on whether to advance it (\"ordered to be reported\"). Failure to act kills the bill.\n\n3. **Floor Consideration:** In the **House**, debate is limited by Rules Committee rules; in the **Senate**, debate is unlimited unless cloture is invoked (filibusters are possible).\n\n4. **Bicameral Reconciliation:** If both chambers pass different versions, a **Conference Committee** works out differences; the resulting report must be approved by both chambers.\n\n5. **Presidential Action:** The President may sign the bill (enacting it into law), allow it to become law without signature (within 10 days while Congress is in session), issue a **pocket veto** (if Congress adjourns within 10 days), or **veto** it outright. A veto can be overridden by a **two-thirds vote in both chambers**.\n\n6. **Enactment:** Once signed or veto-overridden, the bill becomes law and receives an official public law number.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary query=\"congressional schedule April 2026 recess dates\">No usable content extracted from any URL.</Summary>\n\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Among U.S. bills addressing foreign double taxation relief since 2000, how many were enacted and what was the median days from introduction to becoming Public Law?\n\u2022 Scope and definition used  \n  \u2013 \u201cBills addressing foreign double-taxation relief\u201d was interpreted narrowly to mean stand-alone House or Senate bills whose principal purpose is to remove, reduce, or otherwise mitigate double taxation on cross-border income with one or more specific foreign jurisdictions.  \n  \u2013 This excludes (a) omnibus tax packages that happened to contain technical changes to the foreign-tax-credit rules (e.g., the American Jobs Creation Act 2004 or the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017), (b) routine annual extenders, and (c) Senate resolutions giving advice and consent to bilateral tax treaties, which are not enacted as public laws.  \n\n\u2022 Bills located, 2000-present  \n  1. H.R. 5988 (118th Cong., 2023) \u2013 United States\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act (House companion). Passed House 31 Jan 2024; not enacted.  \n  2. S. 3084 (118th Cong., 2023) \u2013 Senate version of the same Taiwan bill. Reported by Senate Finance; not enacted.  \n  3. H.R. 33 (119th Cong., 2025) \u2013 United States\u2013Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act (re-introduced as stand-alone). Passed House 16 Jan 2025; pending in Senate (BillTrack50; Congressman Mike Kelly press release, 16 Jan 2025).  \n  4. S. 1457 (118th Cong., 2023) \u2013 Taiwan Tax Agreement Act. Reported by Senate Foreign Relations; not enacted.  \n  5. Residence-Based Taxation for Americans Abroad Act (discussion draft 2024; not yet introduced as a numbered bill).  \n  6. Various proposals to add I.R.C. \u00a7899 \u201cEnforcement of Remedies Against Unfair Foreign Taxes\u201d (House passed 22 May 2025; Mayer Brown note, 22 May 2025); not enacted.\n\n\u2022 Enactment record  \n  \u2013 None of the above bills has become public law as of February 2026.  \n  \u2013 No other stand-alone double-tax-relief bill has been enacted since 2000; searches of Congress.gov for \u201cdouble taxation,\u201d \u201cdouble-tax,\u201d \u201ctax agreement,\u201d and similar terms yielded no public laws whose central purpose matched the definition.\n\n\u2022 Resulting statistics  \n  \u2013 Number of qualifying bills enacted into law, 2000-present: 0.  \n  \u2013 Median calendar days from introduction to becoming Public Law: not applicable (no enactments).\n\nRemaining information gaps\n  \u2022 If the definition were broadened to include narrower technical fixes inside large tax bills, individual treaty protocols enacted as part of miscellaneous tariff or tax measures, or the 2017 TCJA\u2019s overhaul of the foreign-tax-credit limitation, additional legislation would appear. Those items were deliberately excluded to keep the set comparable to H.R. 33.  \n  \u2022 A confirmatory search of the full Public Law text set for phrases such as \u201cdouble taxation relief\u201d or \u201cto provide relief from double taxation\u201d might uncover an overlooked minor act, but the likelihood is low.\n\nBecause no qualifying bill has been enacted since 2000, the answer to the query is simply: zero, with no calculable median time from introduction to enactment.</Agent_report>\n"
