  "plan_analysis": "The forecaster must judge whether H.R. 33 will finish the entire legislative process (both chambers + president + publication) in only 63 days.  Key missing knowledge:\n\n1. Current state and momentum  \n   \u2022 Where exactly is H.R. 33 now? (House passage? Senate companion? Committee referral? Planned floor action?)  \n   \u2022 Does leadership (Senate Finance Committee, Majority/Minority leaders, White House) support fast-tracking it?  \n   \u2022 Is there an alternative vehicle (e.g., being folded into a broader tax package or a CR) scheduled before May 1?\n\n2. Base rate / historical precedent  \n   \u2022 How often do stand-alone bilateral tax-relief bills (or low-number priority bills) become law, especially within ~60 days of the end of April?  \n   \u2022 Overall success rate and typical time-to-passage for House-passed bills during the 2nd session of recent Congresses.  \n   \u2022 Success rate for bills referred to Senate Finance that emerge and pass quickly.\n\n3. Key drivers / obstacles  \n   \u2022 Congressional schedule between now and May 1 (recesses, must-pass vehicles).  \n   \u2022 Any organized opposition or \u201cholds\u201d in the Senate, or Administration concerns.  \n   \u2022 Whether the bill\u2019s content could instead be implemented by treaty/executive agreement, reducing urgency.\n\n4. Contrarian evidence  \n   \u2022 Indications the Senate may attach the text to a large must-pass bill (e.g., FAA re-authorization, tax extenders), raising the chance of enactment despite time pressure.  \n   \u2022 Signs of partisan gridlock or unrelated hostage-taking that could stall all tax legislation.\n\nThe existing context gives none of this, so the search strategy needs to surface: (a) live status pages and news coverage for H.R. 33 and any Senate counterpart; (b) historical enactment statistics for comparable bills; (c) congressional calendar and legislative vehicle information; (d) commentary from tax-policy outlets and Taiwan-US relations analysts that could reveal insider expectations.",
