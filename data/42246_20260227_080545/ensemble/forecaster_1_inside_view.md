Analysis:
The question at hand is whether H.R. 33 (the United States–Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act) will be enacted into law before May 1, 2026. The resolution criteria hinge on the legislative process and the political dynamics surrounding U.S.-Taiwan relations.

(a) **Source analysis**:
1. **Thruway Article**: This source provides logistical information about travel facilities in New York, unrelated to H.R. 33. It is irrelevant for this analysis.
2. **Farm Bill Update**: The article discusses the partisan dynamics surrounding the 2025 Farm Bill, reflecting a polarized legislative environment but does not directly pertain to H.R. 33.
3. **Employment Law Trends**: This article focuses on employment law risks and litigation trends, providing no relevant insights for H.R. 33.
4. **British Election Analysis**: This source analyzes voting patterns in the UK, irrelevant to U.S. tax legislation.
5. **BuzzFeed Community Jobs**: Discusses low-stress jobs, not relevant to the legislative context of H.R. 33.
6. **Gallup Poll on Israel**: This article details American sentiments regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, unrelated to H.R. 33.
7. **Synaptic Plasticity**: Focuses on neuroscience, with no relevance to the legislative process.
8. **Polling Data on Taiwan's Defense**: Discusses U.S. public support for Taiwan, providing indirect context about U.S.-Taiwan relations but not specific to H.R. 33.
9. **KMT in Taiwan**: Offers insights into Taiwan's political landscape, which may influence U.S.-Taiwan relations but does not directly address H.R. 33.
10. **U.S.-China Relations and Taiwan**: This article discusses U.S. policy shifts towards Taiwan and public sentiment, relevant for understanding the geopolitical context of H.R. 33.

Overall, the only relevant sources are the polling data on Taiwan's defense and the article discussing the KMT, which highlight the importance of U.S.-Taiwan relations and the bipartisan support for measures that strengthen ties with Taiwan.

(b) **Evidence analysis**:
- **Strong evidence**: The bipartisan support for H.R. 33 in the House (423 to 1) and the geopolitical context of U.S.-Taiwan relations indicate a strong likelihood for passage.
- **Moderate evidence**: The recent polling data showing U.S. public support for Taiwan's defense suggests that lawmakers may prioritize legislation that reinforces economic ties with Taiwan.
- **Weak evidence**: Other articles provide limited context or are irrelevant to the question at hand.

(c) **Timeframe analysis**: The prediction timeframe is approximately 1 day from now until May 1, 2026. If this timeframe were halved, it would suggest a more urgent consideration of H.R. 33, potentially increasing its chances of passage. Conversely, if doubled, it may allow for more political maneuvering, possibly complicating its enactment.

(d) **Justification**: The compelling factors supporting the enactment of H.R. 33 include:
- The overwhelming bipartisan support in the House, which reflects a rare consensus in a polarized Congress.
- The importance of U.S.-Taiwan relations amid rising tensions with China, which may motivate lawmakers to strengthen economic ties through tax relief measures.
- Historical precedents of swift passage of tax relief legislation when bipartisan support and economic necessity align.

The outside view base rate of 75% remains valid, as the current political dynamics and bipartisan support for H.R. 33 reinforce this estimate.

Probability calibration:
After considering the evidence and the current political landscape, I adjust my inside view prediction to 80%. This reflects the strong bipartisan support and the urgency of U.S.-Taiwan relations, which could lead to expedited legislative action.

Checklist:
1. The question is about H.R. 33's enactment before May 1, 2026.
2. The established outside view base rate is 75%.
3. "80 out of 100 times, H.R. 33 is enacted before May 1, 2026."
4. Significant evidence: bipartisan support in the House, U.S. public support for Taiwan, and urgency of U.S.-Taiwan relations.
5. Blind-spot: A sudden political shift or scandal could derail bipartisan support, potentially lowering the probability.
6. Status quo outcome: Continued partisanship and inaction could lead to a failure to pass H.R. 33.

Probability: 80%
