Analysis:
The question is whether H.R. 33 (United States–Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act) will be enacted into law before May 1, 2026. The resolution window starts today, February 27, 2026, and ends on May 1, 2026.

Outside view base rate previously established: I predicted a 78% probability that H.R. 33 will be enacted based on historical legislative patterns and the current bipartisan support.

Consistency check: "78 out of 100 times, H.R. 33 is enacted before May 1, 2026." This is aligned with the justification based on bipartisan support and historical trends.

Significant pieces of evidence influencing the final prediction:
1. Bipartisan support for H.R. 33, as evidenced by a 423 to 1 vote in the House.
2. Recent geopolitical context indicating a need for stronger U.S.-Taiwan relations, enhancing the urgency for tax relief.
3. Historical patterns showing that tax relief legislation often passes during favorable economic conditions and bipartisan support.
4. The recent draft of the farm bill and its implications for agricultural programs, indicating a legislative environment conducive to bipartisan cooperation.
5. Public sentiment in favor of U.S. defense of Taiwan, which may influence legislative priorities.

Blind-spot statement: A significant shift in U.S.-China relations or an unexpected political maneuver that undermines bipartisan support could drastically reduce the probability of enactment.

Status quo outcome: If the current trend continues without significant changes, the likelihood of H.R. 33 being enacted remains high due to the existing momentum and bipartisan support.

Probability calibration:
Considering the strong bipartisan support, historical precedents, and current geopolitical context, I would adjust my prediction slightly upwards to reflect increased confidence in the enactment of H.R. 33.

Final prediction: Probability: 82%
