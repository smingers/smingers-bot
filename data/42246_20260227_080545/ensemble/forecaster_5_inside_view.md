Analysis:
The forecasting question is whether H.R. 33 (the United States–Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act) will be enacted into law before May 1, 2026. This outcome hinges on the successful passage of the bill through Congress, particularly in the Senate, by the specified date.

(a) **Source analysis:**
1. **Bipartisan Policy Center Article:** This source provides a historical overview of U.S. tax reform efforts, highlighting the increasing partisanship and challenges faced. The quality is high as it comes from a reputable think tank, but the date is unspecified.
2. **Tax Foundation Article:** Offers historical context on federal income tax rates, which is relevant but lacks specific insights on H.R. 33. The quality is good, but the date is also unspecified.
3. **Agent Reports:** These reports offer a synthesis of insights on H.R. 33, detailing its bipartisan support and potential impacts. The quality is high, as they draw from multiple credible sources and provide a comprehensive view.
4. **Polling Data on U.S. Public Support for Taiwan's Defense:** This source discusses U.S. public sentiment regarding Taiwan, which indirectly relates to the geopolitical context surrounding H.R. 33. The quality is high, but it does not directly address the bill's enactment.

(b) **Evidence analysis:**
- **Strong evidence:** The overwhelming bipartisan support for H.R. 33 (423 to 1 vote in the House) is a significant factor indicating a high likelihood of passage.
- **Moderate evidence:** The historical patterns of tax legislation suggest that bipartisan measures are more likely to succeed, especially when they align with economic interests, which H.R. 33 does.
- **Weak evidence:** While public sentiment regarding Taiwan’s defense is relevant, it does not provide direct causal mechanisms impacting the bill's passage.

(c) **Timeframe analysis:** The prediction timeframe is approximately 14 months from today (February 27, 2026) until the resolution date (May 1, 2026). If this timeframe were halved, the urgency might increase, potentially leading to faster legislative action. Conversely, doubling the timeframe could introduce more uncertainties and political dynamics that might complicate the bill's passage.

(d) **Justification:** The strong bipartisan support for H.R. 33, combined with its alignment with U.S.-Taiwan relations and economic interests, significantly shifts the outside view base rate. The historical success of similar bipartisan tax legislation further supports a favorable outlook for enactment. However, the upcoming election cycle may introduce uncertainties that could impact the timeline and support in the Senate.

Probability calibration:
Considering the strong bipartisan support and historical context, I adjust the outside view base rate of 75% slightly upward to reflect the compelling factors favoring enactment. The final probability is set at 80%, recognizing the potential for unexpected political dynamics.

Checklist:
1. H.R. 33 must be enacted before May 1, 2026, based on Congressional approval.
2. Outside view base rate: 75%.
3. "80 out of 100 times, H.R. 33 is enacted before the deadline." This aligns with the justification provided.
4. Significant evidence: 
   - Bipartisan support in the House (423 to 1).
   - Historical success of similar legislation.
   - Economic rationale for the bill.
5. Blind-spot statement: A significant political shift or unexpected opposition in the Senate could derail the bill, potentially lowering the probability to 60%.
6. Status quo outcome: The current political environment is polarized, but the strong bipartisan backing suggests that the status quo may favor passage rather than inaction.

Probability: 80%
