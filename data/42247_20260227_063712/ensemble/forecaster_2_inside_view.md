### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
1. **Betting markets (Ladbrokes, post-R3)**: France at 1/25 (~96% implied probability before margin removal, ~92-94% after). This is an extraordinarily concentrated market signal. Betting markets aggregate vast information and are historically well-calibrated for sports outcomes. This alone warrants a massive shift from the outside view baseline.

2. **France's R3 record: 3W/0L with bonus points**: France beat Ireland (36-14), Wales (54-12), Italy (33-8) — all convincing, bonus-point wins. Only two matches remain (Scotland away, England home). France need just one win from two to clinch the title mathematically (given their point lead).

3. **Table structure**: France lead by 4 points over Scotland after R3. With 5 bonus-point wins possible in R4/R5, France's lead is substantial. Scotland would need to beat France AND have France lose to England — a two-event combination.

**Moderate evidence:**
4. **Scotland's position**: Scotland are second with 2W/1L. They host France in R4 (Murrayfield), which is their best chance to derail the Grand Slam. Scotland beat England 31-20 in R2, showing real quality. However, France at 1/30 for the title suggests markets don't rate Scotland's chances highly.

5. **Ireland's injury crisis**: While Ireland beat England 42-21 in R3, their earlier loss to France (36-14) and ongoing injuries limit their title chances. They need France to lose twice — extremely unlikely.

**Weak evidence:**
6. **England/Wales/Italy**: All effectively eliminated. England lost to Scotland and Ireland; Wales have 0 wins; Italy's win was in R1 only.

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: ~16 days until final match (March 14, 2026); resolution by May 1, 2026.

**Remaining fixtures**:
- R4: Ireland vs Wales, **Scotland vs France**, Italy vs England
- R5: Ireland vs Scotland, Wales vs Italy, **France vs England**

France need to win at least one of their two remaining matches to be mathematically safe. Even a loss to Scotland in R4 would likely still leave France in a winning position if they beat England in R5 (or if Scotland drops points elsewhere).

**If timeframe halved** (only R4 played): France would still be heavy favorites — they'd need only one win from one match (vs Scotland) to be near-certain champions.

**If timeframe doubled**: No change — tournament ends March 14 regardless.

### (d) Justification

The outside view baseline (France 30%, Ireland 28%, England 18%, Wales 14%, Scotland 8%, Italy 2%) was derived from 2016-2025 historical frequencies. However, current circumstances are **vastly different** from the average historical scenario:

1. **France are 3/3 with bonus points** — this is not a "typical" mid-tournament position. The R3 leader with a 4-point gap and two matches remaining wins the title in the vast majority of historical cases.

2. **Betting markets at 1/25 for France** represent approximately 93-96% implied probability (after removing bookmaker margin). This is one of the strongest signals available and reflects expert/market consensus.

3. **Mathematical structure**: France need one win from two matches. Scotland (their toughest remaining opponent) would need to beat France AND hope England beats France — a compound probability event.

4. **France's quality**: Antoine Dupont fit and captaining; 94% scrum success rate; beat Ireland (the pre-tournament co-favorite) by 22 points.

**Shift from outside view**: The outside view (France 30%) is rendered largely non-analogous because it treats all mid-season positions as equal. The current situation — France 3/3, 4 points clear, two matches remaining — is a specific structural position that historically converts to a title ~85-90%+ of the time. Combined with the betting market signal, I shift France dramatically upward.

**Scotland's residual chance**: Scotland host France in R4 at Murrayfield. If they win, they'd close the gap and create genuine uncertainty for R5. This is the primary scenario where France doesn't win. I assign Scotland ~8-10% — consistent with their 12/1 market odds (~7.7% implied).

**Ireland**: Need France to lose twice. Even if Scotland beats France in R4, Ireland would need to beat Scotland in R5 AND have England beat France. Very low probability (~3-4%).

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view:
- France: 30% → **adjust strongly upward to ~82%** (market signal + structural position)
- Scotland: 8% → **adjust slightly upward to ~10%** (best remaining chance to upset; host France in R4)
- Ireland: 28% → **adjust strongly downward to ~5%** (need two France losses; injury-depleted)
- England: 18% → **adjust strongly downward to ~2%** (two losses already; effectively eliminated)
- Wales: 14% → **adjust strongly downward to ~0.5%** (zero wins; no realistic path)
- Italy: 2% → **adjust downward to ~0.5%** (no realistic path)

**Sanity check**: France at 82% vs market implied ~93%. I'm being slightly more conservative than the market to account for model uncertainty and the Murrayfield factor. The gap between 82% and 93% reflects genuine uncertainty about whether Scotland can win at home against France — a non-trivial event.

## Checklist

1. **Resolution criteria**: Team ranked first in final 2026 Six Nations table (official standings, by May 1, 2026). ✓ My analysis focuses on the final table leader.

2. **Outside view base rate**: France 30%, Ireland 28%, England 18%, Wales 14%, Scotland 8%, Italy 2%. Final prediction heavily shifts France upward — justified by structural mid-tournament position and betting market consensus. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = France; Least likely = Wales/Italy. Makes sense — France are 3/3 with a 4-point lead and two matches remaining. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - France at 1/25 in betting markets (post-R3) — strong market signal ✓
   - France 3W/0L with bonus points, 4 points clear — structural dominance ✓
   - Scotland host France in R4 — primary upset scenario ✓
   - Ireland need two France losses — compound probability, very unlikely ✓
   - England/Wales/Italy mathematically near-eliminated ✓

5. **Blind spot**: Scotland beat France at Murrayfield (form team at home), AND England upset France in R5. This two-event scenario (~5-8% × 30% = 1.5-2.4%) could make France miss out. If this happened, Scotland (not Ireland) would likely win. My Scotland probability of 10% already partially accounts for this.

6. **Status quo**: France winning is the status quo continuation. Slight nudge toward France is appropriate given the strong structural position.

7. **Probabilities sum**: 82 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 100. ✓

Probabilities: [2, 82, 5, 10, 0.5, 0.5]
