**Evaluating historical context**

I need an outside perspective using historical base rates, but today's date is February 27, 2026, and we're in the midst of the tournament. The user asks for an outside view, but the context has current results, which is more of an inside view. Still, I can give a baseline mainly focused on historical context. For the Six Nations from 2000-2025, England and France have 7 titles each, while Ireland and Wales have 6, but the last decade highlights France and Ireland's dominance.**Calculating probabilities**

I'm estimating probabilities for the tournament: France at 27%, Ireland 24%, England 18%, Wales 16%, Scotland 10%, and Italy 5%. Base rates suggest Scotland and Italy have nearly zero chances, but upsets can happen, so I'll assign them a small probability. Wales is historically strong but in a slump recently. 

Next, I’ll analyze sources, focusing on the Six Nations from 2000-2025 and recent odds, weighing the last decade more heavily. Considering the timeframe from February 27 to May 1, historical patterns suggest favorites tend to hold their lead towards the end of short tournaments.**Adjusting champion probabilities**

I'm reconsidering probabilities based on the last 10 champions: France has 2 titles (2022, 2025), Ireland 3 (2018, 2023, 2024), Wales 2 (2019, 2021), and England 3 (2016, 2017, 2020). This gives England and Ireland each 30%, while Wales and France get 20%. However, I should account for current team strength too, which leads me to combine insights from the last 25 seasons. 

This suggests around 25% for England, France, Ireland, and Wales. To avoid assigning a zero probability to Scotland and Italy, I think I’ll distribute it this way: England 24%, France 24%, Ireland 22%, Wales 20%, Scotland 4%, and Italy 1%.**Finalizing probability assessments**

I've settled on the probabilities: France 26%, Ireland 25%, England 23%, Wales 21%, Scotland 4%, and Italy 1%, which sums to 100%. Now, I need to discuss upsets. Since 2000, there haven't been any new winning nations, and in the last two decades, only four teams have claimed victories. Given that, the likelihood of an unexpected outcome from Scotland or Italy seems to be around 1-5%, so I'll go with a total of 5%. Now, let’s craft the response!
