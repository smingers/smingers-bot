**Creating a forecasting rationale**

I’m putting together a comprehensive forecasting rationale using the developer instructions and user template. This is on February 27, 2026, after Round 3 of the Six Nations. France is a strong favorite for the Grand Slam with a record of 3-0. Scotland’s record is a bit confusing—some sources say they lost to Italy, while others indicate they won. Ireland and England have similar results. The points table shows France leading with 15 points, followed by Scotland and others. There’s a 4-point gap there.**Calculating tournament probabilities**

With two rounds to go, France plays Scotland away and then faces England at home. If France wins at least one and earns bonus points, they'll likely secure the title. Scotland could still win if they beat France and Ireland, while Ireland needs Scotland to beat France before facing them themselves. England’s chances are slim, needing to win both remaining matches. After evaluating scenarios, I’m estimating the probabilities: France at about 72%, Scotland 12%, Ireland 10%, England 4%, and low probabilities for Wales and Italy. The numbers add up to 100, which is reassuring. Now, I’ll craft the reasoning for these estimates.
