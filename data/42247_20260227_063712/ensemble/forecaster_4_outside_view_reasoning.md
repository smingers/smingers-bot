**Evaluating Six Nations Predictions**

I'm planning to create an outside view prediction for the winner of the 2026 Six Nations after Round 3. This means I’ll rely on historical data to establish a baseline with minimal inside information. I'll integrate past winners and current standings but won't adjust for recent news. I need to summarize various sources, cluster them where possible, and evaluate the distinction between factual information and opinion. Let's get started on crafting this!**Analyzing Six Nations Winners**

I’m planning to conduct a reference class analysis using winners from the 6 Nations from 2000 to 2025, examining title distribution and the probability of the Round 3 leader winning. There's only 36 days until the final, and by May 1, we'll have resolved the question.

The historical data shows England, France, and Ireland are strong contenders, while Scotland and Italy are currently at zero titles. Since Round 3 leaders win about 70% of the time, I'll estimate probabilities for each team, considering their recent performance. Let's gather that baseline!**Calculating Six Nations Probabilities**

I'm working on predicting the 2026 Six Nations winner based on historical data. Currently, France is the leader, and I’m thinking of allocating 70% probability to them while distributing the remaining 30% among other teams based on their historical performances. The outside view suggests we should focus on past titles without letting current standings influence us too much. 

Based on that, I'm proposing probabilities: France 30%, Ireland 30%, England 18%, Wales 12%, Scotland 7%, and Italy 3%. I want to ensure these reflect realistic expectations and summarize sources for this analysis.
