Analysis  
1. Source analysis (chronological order; all accessed 27 Feb 2026)

• Wikipedia “2026 Six Nations Championship” – factual match results to R3, last edited 24 Feb 26. High reliability for scores/standings; weak for projections.  
• The Standard (23 Feb 26) – mid-tournament table; agrees with Wikipedia on W-L records. Reliable sports desk, four-day old.  
• ESPN preview (Jan 26) – historical form, key players. Useful context, older.  
• Rugby World & The Sun (4-5 Feb 26) – detailed Ireland injury lists. Good for personnel status at tournament start; fair reliability, both dated.  
• Ladbrokes odds piece (24 Feb 26) – bookmaker prices; strong, market-aggregated indicator. Includes some erroneous Round-1 detail but odds themselves are live.  
• Goal.com (25 Feb 26) – betting‐promo summary; confirms France favoured. Medium quality.  
Cross-checking leaves a coherent factual core: after three rounds France are 3-0 and four points clear; Scotland & Ireland 2-1; England 1-2; Italy 1-2; Wales 0-3.

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical pattern: 65 % of R3 leaders (2000-25 sample) lift the trophy.  
• Current table: France +4 log-points with only two fixtures left.  
• Consensus betting markets price France ≈90 % (1/25), independent of single bookmaker margin.

Moderate evidence  
• Dupont & Ramos fit; French squad largely injury-free compared with Ireland’s long list.  
• Scotland host France R4 (home advantage), giving an upset path.  
• Ireland host Scotland R5; one contender guaranteed to take points off the other.

Weak evidence  
• Media narratives on “momentum”, crowd sizes, etc.  
• Anecdotal talk of England “imploding” after two losses (does not add predictive power given mathematics already bleak).

3. Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in 16 days. With such a short horizon, only two match-days remain; probabilities are therefore sticky. Halving the window (to one match-day left) would raise France ~+7 pp; doubling (32 days, full pre-tournament) would have cut France ~-20 pp.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start from outside-view distribution [4, 65, 20, 7, 3, 1].  
Adjustments:

a) Table margin: +15 pp to France (strong evidence).  
b) Bookmaker/market confirmation: +6 pp France, –4 pp Scotland, –5 pp Ireland, –2 pp England.  
c) Fixture difficulty: Scotland still play both France (home) and Ireland (away); Ireland must leapfrog two rivals; England would need a miracle. –2 pp Scotland, –2 pp Ireland, –1 pp England.  
d) Injury situations: Ireland still missing key starters despite some returns; England front-row issues persist. –1 pp Ireland, –1 pp England.  
e) Long-shot symmetry floor: keep Wales/Italy at ≥1 pp each (structural possibility of freak sequence).

Normalise to 100.

Resulting inside-view distribution:

England 2  
France 85  
Ireland 5  
Scotland 6  
Wales 1  
Italy 1

------------------------ FORECASTING CHECKLIST ------------------------
1. Resolution: champion = team topping official Six Nations table on or before 1 May 2026.  
2. Outside view used: [4, 65, 20, 7, 3, 1].  
3. Consistency: Most likely = France (85); least likely = Wales/Italy (1). Makes sense.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each)  
   • France 3-0, four-point cushion with two matches left.  
   • Bookmaker odds imply ~90 % for France.  
   • Round-3 leader historically wins 65 % of time.  
   • Scotland & Ireland still face each other R5.  
   • Ireland ongoing injury deficit at prop & centres.  
5. Blind-spot: France red-cards + injuries lead to consecutive R4 & R5 defeats; Ireland edges tiebreak. Would raise Ireland to ~25 %, France to ~55 %.  
6. Status-quo: continuation of form overwhelmingly favours France; slight tilt toward them applied.  
7. Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum 100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [2, 85, 5, 6, 1, 1]
