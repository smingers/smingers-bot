**Forecasting Six Nations 2026**

I'm focusing on making a detailed forecast for the 2026 Six Nations winner after Round 3, starting from earlier probabilities: France at 65%, Ireland at 20%, Scotland at 7%, England at 4%, Wales at 3%, and Italy at 1%. 

Now I'm checking the current standings. The Standard article says France won three matches, leading by four points over Scotland. However, I found conflicting info regarding Scotland's results against Italy. Wikipedia shows Italy beat Scotland, so I’ll trust that and update the standings accordingly. I need to finalize the actual table.**Analyzing Six Nations Points**

I need to estimate the Six Nations standings based on points. With 5 points for a bonus win, France likely has 14 points from 3 wins and maybe 2 bonuses. Scotland, with 2 wins and 1 loss, could have around 10 points if they earned a bonus. Ireland might also have 10 points with 2 wins and a potential bonus. 

I’m laying out the remaining fixtures in Round 4 and 5 and how teams like France, Scotland, Ireland, England, Wales, and Italy could perform. France is still the favorite, needing just a win against Scotland to secure their lead. Scotland and Ireland face tough paths but it's still possible for them. I’ll set the inside view probabilities as France 75, Ireland 11, Scotland 10, England 3, Wales 0.8, and Italy 0.2.**Assessing Six Nations Outcomes**

I need to analyze the situation for the Six Nations, focusing on the teams’ performances and injury statuses. France looks strong, especially with Antoine Dupont back, but risks arise with them playing away against an improved Scotland. Ireland's chances hinge on France collapsing, which seems unlikely.

By calculating scenarios, let's assume France has 14 points, Scotland 10, and Ireland 9. If France wins against Scotland, they would likely clinch the title, while the probability of that happening stands around 65%. After considering all scenarios, I estimate France has about an 86% chance of winning the championship, leading me to finalize the probabilities at France 83%, Scotland 6%, Ireland 8%, and so on, ensuring it all sums to 100.**Finalizing Championship Probabilities**

I need to finalize the championship probabilities. Starting with my estimates, I have England at 2%, France at 86%, Ireland at 6%, Scotland at 4%, Wales at 1%, and Italy at 1%. That adds up to 100. 

However, considering earlier simulations suggested Scotland might have better odds than Ireland, I realize Scotland must beat both France and Ireland, which is tricky. Ireland must beat Wales and Scotland while hoping France loses. So, I adjust my final probabilities to England at 2%, France at 85%, Ireland at 5%, Scotland at 6%, Wales at 1%, and Italy at 1%. Now it all sums to 100%.
