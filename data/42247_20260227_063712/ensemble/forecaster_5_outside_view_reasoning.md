**Calculating Six Nations probabilities**

I need to determine the outside view probabilities for the 2026 Six Nations winner. Today is February 27, 2026, and while Round 3 has completed, I want to focus on historical patterns instead of current standings, though I could consider them lightly. The goal is to analyze and create a prediction based on past outcomes, perhaps suggesting that the Round 3 leader has historically won about 60% of the time. I'll summarize sources and finalize the reference class for this prediction.**Analyzing historical baselines**

I’m examining the historical baseline for Six Nations champions from 2000 to 2025. The title counts show England and France each have 7 titles, followed by Ireland with 6, Wales also with 6, while Scotland and Italy have none. Over the last 10 seasons (2016-2025), the champions are more evenly split, with England and Ireland each winning 3 times. In recent years, Ireland and France lead the trend. I’m estimating that Round 3 leaders historically win around 70% of the time, so I’ll adjust my predictions to give more weight to France.**Calculating probabilities for Six Nations**

First, I’m establishing a baseline by looking at historical wins since 2000: England and France both at 27 titles, Ireland and Wales at 23. But I need to adjust for recent performance, giving 50% weight to the last five years. Using these, I get probabilities for each team. I then combine that with the longer history for a weighted average. This gives me a new distribution, factoring in the Round 3 leader's 70% win probability for France. I’ll finalize these estimates and ensure they total 100%.
