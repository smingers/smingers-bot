Analysis:
The pre-research context gives only the first three rounds’ results; it does not show the current table, injury/squad news, betting odds, or any quantified historical patterns that link mid-tournament position to the final champion.  
Forecasters still need:

Base rate: How often each nation wins; how often the Round-3 leader goes on to be champion; any comeback patterns.  
Resolution mechanism: Exact tie-break rules used in the official table.  
Key drivers: (1) Current standings/points-difference, (2) Injury or selection news for title contenders, (3) Market-implied probabilities/odds.  
Current state: Up-to-date table, injury updates, bookmaker odds, and previews of Rounds 4-5.  
Contrarian check: Historical examples of late-round turnarounds.

The search plan therefore mixes:
• Five historical queries (base rates, rules, past conversion rates).  
• Three current queries (table, injuries, odds).  
Exactly one Agent query provides a ready-made historical dataset of Round-3 leaders vs. final champions.
