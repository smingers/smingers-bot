Despite being four points behind France, their dominant Twickenham display \u2014 featuring standout performances from Gibson-Park, McCloskey, and Crowley (17 points) \u2014 proved they remain capable of beating anyone.\n\n**England** are described as being \"in freefall\" after back-to-back heavy defeats. Their title hopes are effectively over, with concerns raised about coaching decisions, lineout failures, and a loss of tactical identity. They still face Italy and France.\n\n**Scotland** demonstrated newfound resilience by grinding out an ugly win in Cardiff, keeping their title hopes alive. Their key test remains France at Murrayfield in Round 4.\n\n**France** remain tournament favourites but showed vulnerability against Italy for 70 minutes. Jalibert's pre-match injury forced Ramos to fly-half, and set-piece issues emerged. They lead the table by four points over Ireland.\n\n**Italy** are highlighted as genuine contenders for a top-half finish, having troubled France, beaten Scotland, and narrowly lost to Ireland. Home games against England and Wales still to come make a third win plausible.\n\n**Wales**, despite losing, showed improved fighting spirit \u2014 though they remain in the lower half of the table.\n\n---\n\n### Standings Implication:\nFrance lead by four points but face Scotland (away) and England (home) in remaining rounds. Ireland, Scotland, and potentially others remain mathematically in contention.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: [Agent] Provide dataset of every Six Nations season 2000-2025: identify the team leading the table after Round 3 and the eventual champion; calculate probability that the Round-3 leader wins and list seasons where another team overtook them.\nObjective.  The requester wants a 26-row data set (2000-2025 seasons) with (a) the team that topped the Six Nations table after Round 3 and (b) the team that ultimately won the title; then (c) the empirical probability that the Round-3 leader held on to win, plus (d) a list of the seasons in which the title was won by a team that was NOT leading after Round 3.\n\nWhat we can already fill in.  The eventual champions for every season are well documented.  Rugby World\u2019s historical list (rugbyworld.com \u2013 Six Nations winners, 2000-2025) gives:\n\n\u2022 2000 England \u2022 2001 England \u2022 2002 France \u2022 2003 England \u2022 2004 France \u2022 2005 Wales \u2022 2006 France \u2022 2007 France \u2022 2008 Wales \u2022 2009 Ireland \u2022 2010 France \u2022 2011 England \u2022 2012 Wales \u2022 2013 Wales \u2022 2014 Ireland \u2022 2015 Ireland \u2022 2016 England \u2022 2017 England \u2022 2018 Ireland \u2022 2019 Wales \u2022 2020 England \u2022 2021 Wales \u2022 2022 France \u2022 2023 Ireland \u2022 2024 Ireland \u2022 2025 France (Rugby World, source 1).\n\nThat supplies column (b).\n\nInformation still missing.  None of the supplied search results give a round-by-round standings archive, with the lone exception of a snippet for the 2000 season (\u201cEngland moved one step closer \u2026 after Round 3\u201d \u2013 RugbyPass, source 10) which merely implies England were Round-3 leaders that year but does not enumerate the exact table.  No comprehensive source in the results lists who led after Round 3 for the other 25 editions.\n\nWhy that matters.  Without those Round-3 leaders we cannot:\n\n\u2022 build the requested full dataset,  \n\u2022 count how many times leader = champion,  \n\u2022 calculate the requested probability, or  \n\u2022 list the seasons in which a different team overtook the Round-3 leader.\n\nRemaining gap.  A season-by-season Round-3 standings archive (2000-2025).\n\nRecommended next data source.  The official Six Nations site (sixnationsrugby.com) historically publishes a \u201ctable\u201d page after each round; those URLs are often still accessible by adding a query string such as \u201c\u2026/table?round=3&season=YYYY\u201d.  ESPN Scrum also keeps week-by-week standings in its season pages.  Either archive would let us extract the Round-3 leader for all 26 seasons.\n\nOnce that table is compiled we can:\n\n1.  Count N = 26 seasons.  \n2.  Count k = (seasons where Round-3 leader eventually champion).  \n3.  Probability = k / 26.  \n4.  Create the list of (26 \u2013 k) seasons where the leader was overtaken.\n\nUntil we retrieve that round-3 information the requested probability and \u201covertaken seasons\u201d list cannot be produced.\n\nConclusion.  The champion column is complete (sources above).  The Round-3-leader column is still missing for 25 of the 26 seasons, so the probability calculation and overtaken-season list cannot yet be generated.  An additional targeted search of official Six Nations or ESPN Scrum round-by-round tables is required to finish the data set.</Agent_report>\n"
