I'll work through this systematically.

## Analysis

### (a) Source Analysis

**CBS Sports Bracketology (Feb 28, 2026):** High quality, expert source. Confirms Duke and Arizona as projected #1 seeds. Duke holds #1 overall seed, Michigan also firmly on 1-line. Factual bracketology from established sports outlet.

**FOX Sports/Mike DeCourcy (Feb 27, 2026):** Identifiable expert bracketologist. Confirms Duke, Michigan, Arizona as "clear" #1 seeds, UConn as leading candidate for 4th #1 seed. Reliable.

**Bleacher Report (Feb 27, 2026):** Multiple bracketologists (ESPN, CBS, Bracket Matrix) agree on Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn as the four #1 seeds. Near-consensus from multiple independent sources. Strong.

**Yahoo Sports/Inside the Hall (Feb 26, 2026):** Confirms same four #1 seeds (Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn). Notes JT Toppin (Texas Tech) ACL injury — relevant to a potential #4 seed, not #1 seeds.

**Sports Illustrated/Arizona bracketology (Feb 28, 2026):** Confirms Arizona as #1 seed in West Region. Joe Lunardi (ESPN's expert bracketologist) quoted directly. High quality.

**Deep Research Analysis:** No injuries reported for any of the four projected #1 seeds (Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn). This is factually important — all four appear healthy heading into the tournament.

**NYT/Athletic (Feb 23, 2026):** Author picks Michigan as tournament title favorite despite Duke loss. Suggests Michigan is strong. Opinion from a writer, but informative about team quality.

**Iowa State preview (Feb 28, 2026):** Iowa State (24-4) is a projected #1 seed contender but appears to have settled as a #2 seed per most projections. Not directly relevant to #1 seed count.

**UNC/Caleb Wilson injury (Feb 24, 2026):** Relevant only to UNC's seeding (~5-6 seed), not #1 seeds.

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Near-consensus from multiple independent expert bracketologists (Lunardi/ESPN, CBS Sports, FOX Sports/DeCourcy, Bracket Matrix) on four #1 seeds: Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn. These are all strong teams with excellent records.
- No injuries reported for any projected #1 seed — all four appear at full strength. This is important because injuries are one of the primary mechanisms by which strong teams get upset early.
- Historical base rate: ~3 #1 seeds reach Elite Eight on average, with "3" being the modal outcome.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Duke (26-2) and Michigan are described as the top two teams in the country. Arizona (strong Big 12 record) and UConn (dominant 72-40 win over St. John's) are also elite. This cohort of #1 seeds appears particularly strong.
- The 2025 tournament saw all four #1 seeds reach the Final Four — suggesting recent years may have stronger #1 seeds due to conference consolidation (super-conferences concentrating talent).

**Weak evidence:**
- The 2023 anomaly (0 #1 seeds) was historic and driven by specific circumstances (Purdue's 16-seed loss, specific bracket matchups). Less likely to repeat in any given year.

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

The tournament begins ~March 17-18 (First Four), with Elite Eight games around March 27-28. We are 4 weeks away. The question resolves March 28, 2026.

If the timeframe were halved (2 weeks), we'd have more information about team health and conference tournament performance — predictions might shift slightly based on late-season results. If doubled (8 weeks), we'd be past resolution.

Current uncertainty: We know the projected #1 seeds but not the actual bracket, which affects matchup difficulty. Conference tournaments (typically 1-2 weeks before Selection Sunday ~March 15) could affect seeding.

### (d) Justification

**Base rate:** Historical average ~3 #1 seeds reach Elite Eight. Modal outcome = 3.

**Inside view adjustments:**

1. **Team quality:** The 2026 #1 seeds (Duke 26-2, Michigan, Arizona, UConn) appear to be a particularly strong cohort. Duke and Michigan are described as the top two teams in the country. This slightly favors the "4" outcome over historical base rates.

2. **No injuries:** All four #1 seeds are healthy. Injuries are a primary upset mechanism. This slightly shifts probability toward higher numbers (3 or 4).

3. **Super-conference consolidation:** The Big Ten and ACC have absorbed many programs, potentially concentrating talent at the top. This could make #1 seeds stronger relative to the field.

4. **Regression consideration:** 2025 was exceptional (all 4 reached Final Four). 2026 is independent. No mechanical regression applies.

5. **Bracket uncertainty:** We don't know the actual bracket yet. #1 seeds could face dangerous 4-5 seeds in Sweet 16. This maintains uncertainty around the 3 vs. 4 outcome.

**Net adjustment:** The particularly strong cohort of #1 seeds and their health slightly shifts probability toward 3-4 outcomes. I'll modestly increase the probability of "4" and slightly decrease "0" and "1" relative to the outside view.

## Probability Calibration

Outside view: 0→3%, 1→9%, 2→20%, 3→43%, 4→25%

Inside view adjustments:
- **0:** Reduce slightly (strong, healthy teams make this very unlikely) → 2%
- **1:** Reduce slightly → 7%
- **2:** Maintain → 19%
- **3:** Slight increase (remains modal) → 42%
- **4:** Increase modestly (strong cohort, all healthy) → 30%

Check EV: 0(0.02) + 1(0.07) + 2(0.19) + 3(0.42) + 4(0.30) = 0 + 0.07 + 0.38 + 1.26 + 1.20 = 2.91 ≈ 3. Consistent with historical average.

## Checklist

1. **Resolution criteria:** How many of 4 #1 seeds reach Elite Eight (Round of 8) in 2026 NCAA Tournament. Options: 0,1,2,3,4.

2. **Base rate:** 0→3%, 1→9%, 2→20%, 3→43%, 4→25%. Inside view: 0→2%, 1→7%, 2→19%, 3→42%, 4→30%. Rooted in historical average of ~3.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = 3; Least likely = 0; Makes sense — 3 is modal historically, 0 is historic anomaly.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Historical average ~3 #1 seeds reach Elite Eight (strong predictive power)
   - All four 2026 projected #1 seeds appear healthy and strong (Duke 26-2, Michigan, Arizona, UConn)
   - Near-consensus expert agreement on four #1 seeds being elite teams
   - 2023 (0 seeds) was historic anomaly unlikely to repeat
   - No bracket yet — matchup uncertainty remains

5. **Blind spot:** A bracket where multiple #1 seeds face dangerous 5-seeds or injury occurs during conference tournaments. Could shift toward 2. Probability of "2" might be slightly underweighted.

6. **Status quo:** Historical average of ~3 is the status quo. Current information slightly favors the higher end. Small nudge toward 3-4 is appropriate.

7. **Sum check:** 2+7+19+42+30 = 100 ✓

Probabilities: [2, 7, 19, 42, 30]
