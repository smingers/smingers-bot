Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

- **NCAA bracket page (ncaa.com/march-madness-live/bracket):** Structural/navigational content only. Confirms tournament dates (First Four: March 17-18, Final Four: April 4, Championship: April 6). No bracket results yet. Low informational value for forecasting.

- **Wikipedia - NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament (general):** High-quality encyclopedic source. Confirms 4 #1 seeds per tournament, notes 2025 (all 4 reached Final Four) and 2023 (none reached Elite Eight) as extremes.

- **NCAA selection process article:** Explains committee mechanics. No historical performance data. Factual, authoritative source on process.

- **Wikipedia - 2025 tournament:** High quality. Confirms all four #1 seeds reached Elite Eight AND Final Four in 2025. Notes it was tied with 2007 for lowest seed total in Elite Eight history. Only 4 upsets total in 2025.

- **Wikipedia - 2023 tournament:** High quality. Confirms first-ever occurrence of zero #1 seeds in Elite Eight. Historic anomaly driven by Purdue's 16-seed loss and two Sweet 16 upsets.

- **Elite Eight Wikipedia summary:** Key fact: "On average, three of the four No. 1 seeds make it to the Elite Eight each year." Only one occurrence of zero (2023). This is the most directly relevant historical baseline.

- **NCAA.com - 2023 no #1 seeds article:** Confirms 2023 was historic first. Prior to 2023, only four Elite Eights had just one #1 seed (2000, 2011, 2013, 2022).

- **NCAA.com - seed performance Final Four article:** #1 seeds have 66 Final Four appearances in 40 tournaments. All four reached Final Four only twice (2008, 2025).

- **NCAA.com - how many #1 seeds to pick (Feb 2026):** Authoritative. Final Four distribution: 4 seeds (5%), 3 seeds (10%), 2 seeds (37.5%), 1 seed (40%), 0 seeds (7.5%). Average 1.65 per tournament.

- **Pool Genius/Jason Lisk article (Feb 20, 2026):** Analytics-focused. #1 seeds averaged 3.18 actual wins vs. 3.43 expected. Covers 38 seasons.

- **BetMGM article:** Moderate reliability. Confirms all-four Final Four only twice (2008, 2025).

- **The Only Colors / NBC Philadelphia / bracketodds.cs.illinois.edu:** Supporting statistical sources confirming #1 seed dominance in early rounds.

- **Agent report:** Acknowledges inability to find year-by-year data on exactly how many times "exactly three" #1 seeds reached Elite Eight. Notes only that all-four occurred once in past 14 tournaments and zero occurred once (2023).

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

**Reference Class 1: Historical distribution of #1 seeds reaching Elite Eight (1979-2025)**
Most directly relevant. The Elite Eight Wikipedia summary states the average is ~3 per year. Given:
- 0 seeds: 1 time (2023) — ~2.4% of ~41 tournaments
- 4 seeds: At minimum 2025 confirmed, likely a few others (2008 all four reached Final Four implies all four reached Elite Eight)
- 3 seeds: Appears to be the modal outcome

**Reference Class 2: Final Four distribution (40 tournaments)**
Less directly applicable since Elite Eight ≠ Final Four, but informative. If average Final Four count is 1.65 #1 seeds, Elite Eight count must be higher (since some #1 seeds lose in Elite Eight). Average Elite Eight count ~3 is consistent with average Final Four ~1.65 (roughly half of Elite Eight participants advance).

**Reference Class 3: Recent tournament trends (2015-2025)**
More volatile period. 2023 was historic anomaly; 2025 was historic high. Recent years show wider variance.

**Most suitable:** Reference Class 1, anchored by the Elite Eight Wikipedia statement that "on average, three of the four No. 1 seeds make it to the Elite Eight each year."

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question resolves March 28, 2026 (Elite Eight completion). The tournament begins March 17-18 (First Four), with Elite Eight games typically played around March 27-28. We are currently at February 28, 2026 — approximately 4 weeks before the Elite Eight concludes.

Historical patterns: Since 1985 (40 tournaments), the distribution of #1 seeds in Elite Eight can be inferred:
- 0 seeds: 1 time (2023) = ~2.5%
- 1 seed: ~4 times (2000, 2011, 2013, 2022) = ~10%
- 2 seeds: Moderate frequency
- 3 seeds: Modal outcome (~40-50% of tournaments)
- 4 seeds: Several times including 2008, 2025 = ~10-15%

Working backwards from Final Four data: If average Final Four = 1.65 #1 seeds, and roughly 50-60% of Elite Eight #1 seeds advance to Final Four, then average Elite Eight ≈ 2.75-3.3 #1 seeds. The stated average of "3" is plausible.

**(d) Justification**

The historical baseline strongly centers on 3 as the modal outcome. The distribution appears roughly:
- 0: ~3-5% (historic anomaly, only 2023)
- 1: ~10-12% (rare but has occurred ~4 times)
- 2: ~20-25% (moderate frequency)
- 3: ~40-45% (modal, most common)
- 4: ~15-20% (less common but not rare; 2008, 2025 confirmed, possibly others)

Key considerations:
1. The 2025 tournament was exceptionally dominant for #1 seeds (all four reached Final Four). This could suggest strong teams were seeded #1, but 2026 is a new tournament.
2. No information about 2026 team strengths is available yet (seedings not announced).
3. The question asks about 2026, so we use the historical base rate.
4. The "regression to the mean" after 2025's extreme outcome doesn't mechanically apply — each tournament is independent.
5. The stated average of ~3 per year is the best anchor.

Outside view calibration:

Using the historical distribution with the Elite Eight Wikipedia average of ~3 as the central tendency:

- **0 seeds:** Only happened once in ~41 tournaments (2023). Base rate ~2-3%.
- **1 seed:** Happened ~4 times (2000, 2011, 2013, 2022). Base rate ~8-10%.
- **2 seeds:** Moderate frequency. Estimating ~20-22%.
- **3 seeds:** Modal outcome. Estimating ~38-42%.
- **4 seeds:** Has happened multiple times. With 2008 and 2025 confirmed, and possibly 1-2 other years. Estimating ~18-22%.

Cross-check: Expected value = 0(0.03) + 1(0.09) + 2(0.21) + 3(0.40) + 4(0.20) = 0 + 0.09 + 0.42 + 1.20 + 0.80 = 2.51... hmm, this is lower than the stated average of 3.

Let me recalibrate upward. If the true average is ~3:
- 0: 2%, 1: 8%, 2: 18%, 3: 42%, 4: 30%
- EV = 0 + 0.08 + 0.36 + 1.26 + 1.20 = 2.90 ≈ 3 ✓

But 30% for "4" seems high given only 2 confirmed cases in 40 tournaments. Let me try:
- 0: 3%, 1: 10%, 2: 20%, 3: 45%, 4: 22%
- EV = 0 + 0.10 + 0.40 + 1.35 + 0.88 = 2.73

The discrepancy may be because the "average of 3" is approximate or the distribution is right-skewed. Given the agent report couldn't confirm exact year-by-year data, I'll settle on a distribution that gives EV ~2.8-3.0 and reflects the stated modal outcome of 3.

Final calibration:
- 0: 3%
- 1: 9%
- 2: 20%
- 3: 43%
- 4: 25%
EV = 0 + 0.09 + 0.40 + 1.29 + 1.00 = 2.78

This seems reasonable given uncertainty. The 4-seed outcome at 25% accounts for the fact that all-four reaching Elite Eight is somewhat common (since #1 seeds are very strong through the first three rounds) even if all-four reaching Final Four is rare.

Option_A: 3

Option_D: 43
Option_E: 25
