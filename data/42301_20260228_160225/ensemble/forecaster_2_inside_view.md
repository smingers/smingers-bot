I'll work through this systematically.

## Analysis

### (a) Source Analysis

**CBS Sports Bracketology (Feb 28, 2026)**: High quality, expert bracketologist source. Confirms Duke, Arizona, Michigan, UConn as projected #1 seeds. Factual: Duke holds #1 overall seed; Arizona is #1 in West. Opinion: "significant margin of error" for Duke/Arizona to retain #1 seeds.

**Sports Illustrated/Arizona Bracketology (Feb 28, 2026)**: Reliable sports outlet. Confirms Arizona as #1 West seed per ESPN's Joe Lunardi (named expert). Factual: Arizona "firmly in place as a one seed."

**Bleacher Report/March Madness Schedule (Feb 27, 2026)**: Moderate quality aggregator. Factual: Near-consensus on Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn as #1 seeds across ESPN, CBS, Bracket Matrix. Useful confirmation.

**FOX Sports/DeCourcy (Feb 27, 2026)**: Named expert (Mike DeCourcy). Factual: Duke, Michigan, Arizona remain clear #1 seeds; UConn is leading candidate for 4th #1 seed.

**Yahoo Sports/Illini Nation (Feb 26, 2026)**: Moderate quality. Factual: Selection committee released top 16 on Feb 24; Michigan (#1 Midwest), Arizona (#1 West), Duke (#1 East) confirmed. UConn projected #1 South.

**Deep Research Injury Analysis**: No injuries reported for projected #1 seeds (Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn). JT Toppin (Texas Tech, projected #4 seed) suffered ACL tear - relevant to bracket but not to #1 seeds directly.

**NYT/Athletic (Feb 23, 2026)**: High quality. Expert opinion: Author picks Michigan as title favorite despite Duke loss. Factual: Duke beat Michigan 68-63.

**Iowa State Preview (Feb 28, 2026)**: Official athletics site. Factual: Iowa State (24-4) is projected #1 seed per CBS Sports (Texas Tech article confirms this).

**Sporting News Bracketology (Feb 9, 2026)**: Older but from reputable outlet. Arizona, Michigan, Duke, UConn as #1 seeds - consistent with later projections.

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Multiple independent expert sources (Lunardi/ESPN, DeCourcy/FOX, CBS Sports, Bracket Matrix) unanimously project Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn as #1 seeds. This is the strongest possible consensus heading into Selection Sunday. These four teams appear healthy and dominant.
- Historical base rate: ~75% per-seed survival rate to Elite Eight over 46 tournaments; average of ~3 #1 seeds reach Elite Eight.
- No injuries to projected #1 seeds reported as of Feb 28, 2026.

**Moderate evidence:**
- The four projected #1 seeds (Duke 26-2, Michigan ~25-2, Arizona ~25-3, UConn 25-3) all have exceptional records, suggesting this is a particularly strong #1 seed cohort. Stronger #1 seeds historically perform better.
- Iowa State (24-4, projected #2 seed) is strong but not at #1 seed level - the #1 seeds appear clearly differentiated from the field.

**Weak evidence:**
- 2025 saw all 4 #1 seeds reach Final Four (even stronger than Elite Eight). 2023 saw 0. These extreme outcomes don't strongly predict 2026.
- The upcoming Arizona vs. Iowa State matchup could affect seeding but not the count of #1 seeds.

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: ~28 days until Elite Eight games (March 28, 2026 resolution). Selection Sunday ~2 weeks away.

If timeframe halved (2 weeks): We'd only know who the #1 seeds are, not outcomes - prediction would stay near base rates.

If timeframe doubled (2 months): Tournament would be complete; this would be resolved. No meaningful change to methodology.

The current moment is pre-tournament, so we're essentially forecasting from base rates with minor adjustments for team quality.

### (d) Justification

The outside view base rates are:
- 0: 2%, 1: 9%, 2: 26%, 3: 43%, 4: 20%

**Adjustments from inside view:**

1. **Cohort strength**: The 2026 #1 seeds (Duke ~26-2, Michigan ~25-2, Arizona ~25-3, UConn ~25-3) are all elite teams with exceptional records. Historically, when #1 seeds are this clearly dominant, they tend to perform above average in early rounds. This slightly shifts probability toward higher outcomes (3 or 4).

2. **No injuries**: All four projected #1 seeds are healthy. This is a mild positive signal relative to years where injuries affected #1 seeds.

3. **Parity concern**: The 2026 field appears deep (SEC with 10-11 teams, Big Ten with 9, ACC with 8-9). Deep fields can produce upsets. However, this is typical for modern March Madness.

4. **Recent history**: 2025 = 4 (all reached Final Four), 2023 = 0. These extremes don't strongly predict direction but remind us of variance. The mean of 3 remains the anchor.

5. **No structural changes**: Standard 68-team format, no rule changes. Base rates remain applicable.

The inside view adjustment is modest - slightly upward toward 3 and 4 given cohort strength and health, with small reductions in 0 and 1.

## Probability Calibration

Base rates: 0=2%, 1=9%, 2=26%, 3=43%, 4=20%

Adjustments:
- Reduce 0 slightly to 1% (healthy, dominant field of #1 seeds)
- Reduce 1 slightly to 8% (same reasoning)
- Keep 2 at 25%
- Slightly increase 3 to 44% (strong cohort, healthy teams)
- Slightly increase 4 to 22% (strong cohort, 2025 precedent, all four teams appear elite)

Total: 1+8+25+44+22 = 100 ✓

## Checklist

1. **Resolution**: Count of #1 seeds reaching Elite Eight (Round of 8) in 2026 NCAA Tournament. Options: 0,1,2,3,4. ✓

2. **Base rate**: 0=2%, 1=9%, 2=26%, 3=43%, 4=20%. Final prediction rooted here with minor upward shift toward 3-4. ✓

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = 3; Least likely = 0; Makes sense - historical average is ~3, and strong cohort slightly favors higher outcomes. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Near-unanimous expert consensus on 4 strong, healthy #1 seeds (Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn) ✓
   - Historical base rate: average ~3 #1 seeds reach Elite Eight ✓
   - No injuries to projected #1 seeds as of Feb 28 ✓
   - Deep tournament field (potential for upsets) - mild countervailing factor ✓

5. **Blind spot**: A major upset in the first or second round (e.g., a 12-seed or 13-seed taking out a #1) could make "2" or "1" more likely. This is always possible but historically rare for #1 seeds.

6. **Status quo**: Historical average of 3 is the status quo; slight nudge toward 3 is appropriate.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs. ✓

Probabilities: [1, 8, 25, 44, 22]
