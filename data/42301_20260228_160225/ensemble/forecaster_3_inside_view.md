Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Resolves to how many of the four 2026 men’s NCAA Tournament #1 seeds reach the Elite Eight (regional finals), decided by results by ~Mar 28, 2026.

2) Outside view base rate (given)
Outside-view distribution (for #1 seeds reaching Elite Eight):
- 0: 3
- 1: 9
- 2: 20
- 3: 43
- 4: 25

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; date)

Bracketology / seeding-projection sources (directly relevant to who the likely #1 seeds are; indirectly relevant to their strength):
- CBS Sports bracketology (Feb 28, 2026): Identifies projected #1 seeds (Duke, Arizona; implies Michigan also in contention for #1 overall) and discusses “margin for error” on the 1-line. High-quality mainstream bracketology; still speculative pre–Selection Sunday.
- FOX Sports (DeCourcy) on UConn “final #1 seed” (Feb 27, 2026): Explicitly says Duke/Michigan/Arizona clear 1-seeds, UConn leading for 4th. Reasonably credible bracketologist; still projection.
- Bleacher Report “bracketology predictions” (Feb 27, 2026): Says consensus top four #1 seeds are Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn across ESPN/CBS/Bracket Matrix. Useful as “multiple independent sources agree,” but BR itself is an aggregator and can be noisier than primary bracketologists.
- Sporting News bracketology (Feb 9, 2026): Projects Arizona/Michigan/Duke/UConn as 1-seeds. Credible media; projection and now slightly older.
- Yahoo/“Good Morning, Illini Nation” referencing committee top-16 reveal (Feb 26, 2026): Reports the committee’s top 16 with Michigan and Arizona as #1s and Duke as #1 (and UConn high). This is closer to an “official signal” (committee snapshot), though not binding. Medium-high value.

Team-strength / injury context (indirectly relevant; injuries can materially affect upset risk):
- The Athletic/NYT analysis (Feb 23, 2026): Notes Duke and Michigan look title-caliber; raises questions about UConn’s Big East strength (more opinion/analysis, but from a credible outlet).
- “Deep research” injury scan (compiled from late-Feb coverage): No significant injuries reported for projected #1 seeds (Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn). This is consistent with multiple reports, but it’s a synthesis rather than a single primary injury-report source.
- Iowa State / Texas Tech preview + CBS model article (Feb 28, 2026): Mentions Iowa State as projected #1 seed by CBS model context, and a major injury to Texas Tech’s star. Relevant mainly as: (i) #1 seed line competition is strong; (ii) injuries exist elsewhere in the field, potentially changing upset profiles.

Other sources mostly not directly relevant to #1 seeds / Elite Eight counts:
- UNC bracketology pieces (Feb 23/25, 2026) and Missouri bracketology (Feb 27): Mostly about mid-seed teams; low relevance.
- ESPN bubble watch (late Feb): bubble composition only; low relevance.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
1) Historical pattern: #1 seeds frequently reach Elite Eight; “3 of 4” is near the center of the long-run distribution. (Structural and repeatedly observed.)
2) Multiple independent bracketology sources converge on a stable top tier (Duke/Michigan/Arizona/UConn) with no reported major injuries. Convergence reduces variance in “quality of #1 seeds.”

Moderate evidence
3) Committee top-16 reveal suggests the committee currently views the same teams as top-tier (or adjacent). This is a useful signal about who will be #1 seeds and implies résumé strength.
4) No major injuries among projected #1 seeds (injuries are a major driver of underperformance); absence modestly increases odds of deep runs versus a world with a compromised #1 seed.

Weak evidence
5) Narrative/analysis that UConn’s Big East schedule strength could be a vulnerability (plausible mechanism—less-tested teams can be more upset-prone—but this is not a quantified effect and may be overstated).

Net directional implication vs outside view:
- Slight upward pressure on “3” and especially “4” (healthy, consensus-strong #1s), offset a bit by general March variance and at least one #1 seed (likely UConn) potentially being more vulnerable depending on draw.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Today is Feb 28, 2026; Elite Eight completes around Mar 28, 2026 (~4 weeks).  
- If the timeframe were halved (we were already on Selection Sunday / bracket set): I’d narrow uncertainty and likely push more mass toward 3–4 (because we’d know regions, matchups, and exact #1 seeds).
- If doubled (we were 8 weeks out): I’d push more mass toward 1–2 and away from 4 (more time for injuries/roster changes and more uncertainty about who actually ends up as #1 seeds).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from base rates)

Status quo if nothing changes:
- #1 seeds are likely to be Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn (broad bracketology consensus; committee snapshot consistent).
- No major injuries reported among these likely #1 seeds.
- That combination resembles “typical strong #1 seed years,” not an obvious “chaos year” setup like 2023 (which featured extraordinary early losses).

Why not a huge shift?
- Even dominant #1 seeds still face single-elimination variance and matchup-specific pitfalls in the Sweet 16.
- We do not yet know bracket paths (regions, opponents, injury developments in March).

So: modest shift from the outside view toward more 4-seed Elite Eight outcomes, slight trim to 0–1 outcomes.

Probability calibration

Start (outside view): [3, 9, 20, 43, 25] for [0,1,2,3,4].

Adjustments:
- Decrease 0 and 1 slightly (healthy, consensus-elite #1s): -1 total from (0,1)
- Slightly decrease 2 (a bit less likely than baseline given current “top looks strong”): -1
- Increase 4 (more plausible with strong/healthy top line): +3
- Keep 3 near modal (still most likely): roughly stable/slightly down to fund 4

Final inside-view distribution: [3, 8, 19, 42, 28]

Checklist:
1) Resolution/options check: Counts how many of the four 2026 #1 seeds make Elite Eight (regional finals) by ~Mar 28, 2026. Options 0–4. ✓
2) Outside view stated: [3,9,20,43,25]. ✓
3) Consistency check: Most likely = 3 (then 4). Least likely = 0. Fits history + current “strong/healthy 1-line.” ✓
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - Long-run baseline centers on 3 #1 seeds in Elite Eight.
   - Broad bracketology consensus: Duke/Michigan/Arizona/UConn on 1-line.
   - No major injuries reported for projected #1 seeds as of Feb 28.
   - Some analytic concern UConn/Big East strength could raise upset risk (small).
5) Blind spot: If the bracket creates especially dangerous Sweet-16 matchups (elite underseeded teams / injury-return teams) in multiple regions, 1–2 could jump materially. This would shift probability from 4/3 to 2/1. ✓
6) Status quo outcome: “3” remains the modal outcome; only modest nudge toward “4.” ✓
7) Technicalities: Probabilities 0–100, sum to 100, no % signs. ✓

Probabilities: [3, 8, 19, 42, 28]
