**Forecasting NCAA Tournament Outcomes**

I need to analyze the upcoming 2026 NCAA tournament by considering projected #1 seeds like Duke, Michigan, Arizona, and UConn. I must forecast how many of these seeds will reach the Elite Eight. Since the seeds aren’t finalized as of February 28, I’ll evaluate the strength and health of these teams, historically assessing that about 40-65% of #1 seeds reach the Elite Eight. I've noted that historically, around 85% reach the Sweet 16, possibly impacting their chances.**Estimating Elite Eight Chances**

I’m analyzing the probability of #1 seeds reaching the Elite Eight and estimating it to be around 60-75%. I’m thinking that with an average of 3 expected seeds making it, I might go with 0.72 probability, resulting in approximately 2.88 expected teams. Considering the current consensus on top seeds and their stability, there's potential for a higher number reaching this stage. However, I also recognize that the strength of their respective conferences might affect upset risks, particularly for UConn in the Big East.**Adjusting Seed Probabilities**

I’m looking at the selection committee's top 16, which includes #1 seeds like Michigan, Arizona, Duke, and maybe UConn. Bracket analysts seem to agree that these teams are strong, especially with no injuries. I could shift the probability towards having 3 or 4 seeds reach the Elite Eight, adjusting from previous estimates. I want to reduce the chance of 0-1 seeds making it since multiple upsets seem less likely with these strong contenders, but upsets can still happen. I'll calculate using probabilities for each team based on their perceived strengths.**Calculating Binomial Distribution**

I’m calculating the probability distribution for the number of #1 seeds reaching the Elite Eight. I started with three seeds all having a probability of 0.78 and found the outcomes for 0, 1, 2, and 3 seeds. Then, I included a fourth seed, adjusting its probability to 0.70. The resulting distribution shows a higher probability for 4 seeds than expected. I think using a probability of 0.72 for each seed aligns better with realistic expectations. I'll set my final probabilities to sum to 100% for a more reasonable expectation of outcomes based on these analyses.**Organizing Analysis for Selection**

I need to ensure all required components are included and analyze each source briefly. It’s also important to weigh the evidence based on a timeframe of 28 days leading up to selection day, which resolves on 3/28. I might discuss adjustments in this timeframe, like halving or doubling it. Additionally, I should incorporate the checklist items and present the final probabilities in the order: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4'. Let’s use markdown to structure this neatly.
