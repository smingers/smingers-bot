**Analyzing Elite Eight Predictions**

I'm looking to predict how many #1 seeds reach the Elite Eight in 2026. I need to examine historical data, like whether an average of three of four #1 seeds make it, which I'll check for accuracy. It seems each #1 seed needs to win three games first. Historically, the probability of a #1 seed reaching the Elite Eight appears to be about 0.67. I’ll calculate based on their records to get an accurate probability.**Calculating Elite Eight Distribution**

I’ve got a probability of around 0.64 for each #1 seed reaching the Elite Eight. Using a Binomial distribution with n=4 and p=0.64, I get specific probabilities for k values from 0 to 4, which yield a mean of 2.56 — not quite 3. The Elite Eight wiki's claim might overstate things. I’ll need to backtrack, as I remember instances where all four #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight, like in 2016. There's also data showing #1 seeds have made it 158 times, but it doesn't quite match up.**Exploring Empirical Data for Predictions**

I’m considering using empirical data for predicting how many #1 seeds reach the Elite Eight. From NCAA.com bracket advice, it suggests an average of about 2.5 for the Elite Eight and 1.65 for the Final Four. Each seed must win three games, and my estimated probability of 0.64 aligns. I’ll aim for a reference class from 1985-2025, excluding 2020. I’ll also think about correlations but keep it simple with a binomial approach. I found that all four #1 seeds have made it recently, like in 2025.**Assessing Elite Eight Probabilities**

I’m realizing that since all four #1 seeds reached the Final Four, that implies they did make it to the Elite Eight. There are likely more years when all four made it to the Elite Eight but not to the Final Four, maybe around 15% of the time. My binomial model shows roughly 17%. I can set p at about 0.65, which gives me a distribution for options 0-4. This looks promising, especially since I have to keep the probability of 0 low, around 2-3%. Timeframe-wise, we can focus on historical data, which remains relevant.**Finalizing Outside View Calibration**

I'm focusing on how to calibrate my outside view using binomial modeling. I'll base it on the probability for individual seeds, which seems to range around 0.64 to 0.66. I’ll also take into account recent variabilities that could lead to fat tails. It will be important to add some extra weight to the probabilities for 2 and 3 seeds while keeping the probability for 0 low but still possible. Now, I’ll work on crafting the final output with the specified sections.
