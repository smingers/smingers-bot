Analysis (concise version – full reasoning folded into checklist items)

1. Paraphrase & criteria  
Options = number (0-4) of regional No. 1 seeds that win three games and appear in the 2026 Elite Eight. Games are played 19-27 Mar 2026; outcome known by 28 Mar 2026.

2. Outside-view base (64-team era 1985-2025, excl. 2020)  
Per-#1 probability to reach E8 ≈0.64 ⇒ Binomial(4,0.64).  
Base distribution: [2, 12, 31, 38, 17].

3. Consistency line  
Most likely = “3”; least likely = “0” – aligns with historical frequencies and argument.

4. Key inside-view evidence  
a. Strong consensus (ESPN, CBS, FOX, Bleacher Report 24-28 Feb 2026) that Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn are the current 1-line.  
b. No material injuries reported for those four; each top-10 in both NET & Ken-Pom.  
c. Predictive metrics: average Ken-Pom rank of projected 1’s is 3.5 vs historical mean ≈4.8 (2012-25 sample) – implies slightly higher per-team strength.  
d. No current “killer” No. 2/3 seeds with clear top-5 efficiency likely to share a region (Iowa St., Illinois, Purdue cluster just below).  
e. Tournament variance remains large: 2023 produced zero #1s; correlation between regions inflates tail risk.

5. Blind-spot statement  
A late conference-tourney injury (e.g., to Duke’s McCain) or unexpected committee bracket that pairs a 1-seed with Houston/Iowa St. in Sweet 16 could drop the p(3-4) by 10–15 pts.

6. Status-quo tilt  
Current information tilts slightly above historical mean for each #1; keep modest edge to higher counts.

7. Technicalities checked – probabilities 0-100, sum 100.

Probabilities: [2.5, 9.5, 28, 40, 20]
