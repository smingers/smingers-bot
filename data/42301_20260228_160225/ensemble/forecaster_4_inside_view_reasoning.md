**Forecasting Elite Eight probabilities**

I’m looking to forecast how many #1 seeds will make it to the Elite Eight in the 2026 March Madness. I have outside probabilities like 2% for 0 seeds, 12% for 1 seed, and so on up to 17% for 4 seeds. Since it's February 28, 2026, I need to factor in inside information about consensus #1 seeds: Duke, Michigan, Arizona, and UConn. While evaluating these teams, I’ll estimate their probabilities for reaching the Elite Eight and consider their strength compared to typical #1 seeds.**Analyzing Elite Eight probabilities**

I’m considering how multiple strong #2 seeds like Iowa State, Illinois, and Purdue could upset the top seeds. Looking closely at the #1 seeds: I've assigned Duke a probability of 0.72, Michigan 0.70, Arizona 0.68, and UConn 0.66 to reach the Elite Eight. The average probability comes out to 0.69. I’m computing the binomial distribution for these probabilities, observing that historically, three #1 seeds tend to reach this stage. However, I also have to account for possible correlations in upset scenarios. Adjusting the distribution slightly favors extremes while reflecting current strengths and uncertainties.**Refining Elite Eight probabilities**

I’ve noticed that my binomial probabilities show only a 0.9% chance for 0 #1 seeds reaching the Elite Eight, but historically it’s been closer to 2.6%. So, I’m adjusting that to about 2.5%. For four seeds, I estimate roughly 12%, considering past trends. I also realized I might need to adjust my initial 22.6% estimate for four down to 20%. After recalibrating, I’ve set my final probabilities as follows: 0: 2.5%, 1: 9.5%, 2: 28%, 3: 40%, and 4: 20%. Now, I’ll compile my analysis and finalize everything.
