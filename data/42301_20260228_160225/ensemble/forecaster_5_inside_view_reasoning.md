**Evaluating tournament seeds**

I’m analyzing the tournament's dynamics, noting that 46 tournaments with 4 seeds each yield 184 #1 seeds. The average survival rate of 3 out of 4 seeds means a solid 75% probability, but distribution suggests some unusual outcomes. For 2026, I see strong contenders like Duke and UConn, estimating a 78% survival chance for each. This shifts the expected #1 seeds in the Elite Eight to about 3.12. Historical data shows higher parity but also highlights exceptions, making it a complex landscape to navigate.**Adjusting seed probabilities**

I need to think about bracket matchups, though details aren't clear yet. Projected #1 seeds are strong, but I have to adjust probabilities for possible outcomes, increasing the weight for 3 and 4 seeds while slightly lowering for 1 and 2 seeds. 

Using a binomial distribution with a survival probability of 0.78, I calculated the chances for each seed count. It seems that having four #1 seeds surviving is historically unlikely, so I'm adjusting those probabilities to reflect a more realistic scenario. Now, I’ll work on crafting a final analysis based on these insights.
