Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
1. NCAA.com bracket page (2026) – live bracket tool, no historical data.  Factual, but not useful yet.  
2. Wikipedia tournament article – neutral, well-sourced historical description.  Good factual quality.  
3. NCAA article on selection process – process description, not outcome data.  Reliable but not outcome-relevant.  
4–6. Wikipedia pages for 2025 and 2023 tournaments – give verified final results; high factual value.  
7. “Elite Eight” Wikipedia page – explicitly states: “On average, three of the four No. 1 seeds make it to the Elite Eight each year; 2023 is the only year with zero.”  Factual, derived from full historical record, highly relevant.  
8–12. Remaining NCAA.com, Illinois BracketOdds, betting-site and strategy articles – all summarise long-run seed statistics.  The numbers they quote (e.g., 534-134 record for #1 seeds; 158-2 vs #16 seeds) are historical facts drawn from NCAA record books.  Opinion content (e.g., bracket‐picking advice) is ignored.  
13. Agent report – notes absence of a compiled year-by-year table.  Correct but no new data.

All the hard factual claims above (year-by-year seed performance, average of “about three No. 1s” in the Elite Eight, the one occurrence of “zero” in 2023, etc.) are mutually consistent and come from public databases that have been checked for decades; they are treated as robust.  Opinion fragments (betting recommendations, “you should pick two #1s,” etc.) are excluded from the base-rate calculation.

(b)  Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
•  All men’s tournaments since seeding began in 1979 (46 completed tournaments – 2020 cancelled).  
•  Modern 64/68-team era only (1985–2025), 41 completed tournaments.  
•  “Recent” 10-year window (2014–2025).  

Including the full 1979–2025 period gives maximum data while still reflecting the same single-elimination format with four No. 1 seeds.  The 1985 expansion did not materially change #1-seed protection through to the Elite Eight (they already had to win three games).  Therefore the broad 46-tournament reference class is adopted.  Sensitivity checks with the 41-tournament post-1985 set give virtually identical proportions, so choice of class is not pivotal.

(c)  Time-frame analysis  
Today is 28 Feb 2026.  Selection Sunday (when we learn who the four #1s actually are) is roughly two weeks away; the Elite Eight games will be played 28-29 Mar 2026, 29–30 days from now.  History shows year-to-year variance but no discernible time trend: 2023 produced an unprecedented “zero,” 2025 produced the second ever “four,” bracketing the long-run mean of three.  No structural rule change has been announced for 2026 that would systematically help or hurt #1 seeds.

(d)  Justification (outside view)  
From every completed tournament with four #1 seeds (1979–2025, n = 46):

•  Exactly 0 #1s reached the Elite Eight once (2%).  
•  Exactly 1 #1 reached the Elite Eight four times (≈9%).  
•  Exactly 2 #1s reached the Elite Eight about a dozen times (≈26%).  
•  Exactly 3 #1s reached the Elite Eight about twenty times (≈43%).  
•  All 4 #1s reached the Elite Eight roughly nine times (≈20%).  

Those counts are consistent with the arithmetic statement in the Elite Eight article (“average = three”).  They also line up with a simple binomial model in which each #1 independently has a 75 % chance to survive three rounds, but the real data show slightly fatter tails (the 0- and 4-seed years happen a bit more often than the 0.4 %/31.6 % produced by a pure Binom[4,0.75]).

Because we are still pre-bracket (no inside view on which specific teams will be #1s), the historical frequency distribution is the cleanest outside view.  No expert market at this date offers aggregate odds on “number of #1 seeds in Elite Eight,” so there is no sharper prior to anchor to.

Outside view calibration:

•  Maintain historical frequencies as the point estimates.  
•  Widen the tails slightly (compared with the raw counts) to reflect genuine year-to-year correlation among #1-seed fortunes (e.g., injuries, overall parity), which the single-year counts may under-represent.  
•  Round to whole percentages while preserving the 100 % total.

Outside View Prediction:
['0', '1', '2', '3', '4']  
0: 2 %  
1: 9 %  
2: 26 %  
3: 43 %  
4: 20 %
