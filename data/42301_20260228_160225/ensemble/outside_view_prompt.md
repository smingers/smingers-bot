You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
How many #1 seeds will reach the Elite Eight in the NCAA's 2026 March Madness?

Question background:
The [NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament), commonly known as March Madness is an annual single-elimination basketball tournament held in the United States to determine the men's college basketball national champion.

Culminating each yearly season, 68 teams are selected for the championship tournament based on recent performance, with inclusion partly determined by the [NCAA committee](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2025-01-16/how-field-68-di-mens-teams-picked-march-madness-each-season). Along with inclusion, the committee also determines bracket assignments, with each team receiving a seed based upon its expected ability.

Due to the format of the tournament beginning with regional brackets, four separate teams each receive the No. 1 bracket seed as the top team in their respective region. In [2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament), all top seeds reached the final 4, however in [2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament) none reached the final 8.

`{"format":"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period","info":{"post_id":42290,"question_id":42077}}`

The options are: ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as the amount of Number 1 bracket seeds that qualify for the Regional Finals (Round of 8) in the [2026 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament](https://www.ncaa.com/march-madness-live/bracket).

Additional fine-print:
If the tournament's format is changed or interrupted, this question will resolve based upon the final eight teams.

If the tournament is cancelled or delayed such that results remain unknown before May 1, 2026, this question will be annulled.

## Summary: How the Field of 68 DI Men's Teams Is Picked for March Madness

This NCAA article explains the three-phase process by which the Division I Men's Basketball Committee selects, seeds, and places teams into the March Madness bracket each season.

---

### Phase I: Selecting 37 At-Large Teams
- The committee selects 37 at-large teams (in addition to 31 automatic conference qualifiers).
- Members submit initial ballots listing teams they believe deserve at-large bids.
- Teams receiving sufficient votes are placed on an "under-consideration board," and repeated voting rounds narrow the field until all 37 spots are filled.
- Conflict-of-interest rules require members to recuse themselves from voting on teams they represent or have family ties to.

---

### Phase II: Seeding All 68 Teams
- The committee ranks all 68 teams from strongest to weakest through repeated voting rounds.
- Metrics used include: BPI (ESPN), KenPom, KPI, NET, Strength of Record (ESPN), Torvik, Wins Above Bubble, and NCAA Statistics.
- After initial seeding, a "scrubbing" process allows teams to be moved up or down by simple-majority vote to refine accuracy.

---

### Phase III: Building the Bracket
Key bracketing principles relevant to #1 seeds include:

- **No. 1 seeds are placed first**, assigned to four separate regions. The overall No. 1 seed selects its preferred region and first/second-round site.
- The committee aims for **regional competitive balance**, preferring no more than six seed-value points separating regions.
- **Conference separation rules** prevent teams from the same conference meeting too early (e.g., teams that played 3+ times cannot meet before the Regional Final).
- Teams are kept **geographically close to their home region** when possible.
- Top-seeded teams will **not be placed where they face a significant home-crowd disadvantage**.
- A scheduling constraint ensures not all four #1 seeds are placed at Thursday/Saturday sites — the fourth is moved to a Friday/Sunday site.

---

### Committee Composition
The 12-member committee includes representatives from autonomy conferences and nonautonomy conferences, serving five-year terms. The current chair is **Keith Gill, Commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference**.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament">
## Summary: 2025 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament

### Key Outcome Relevant to the Question
**All four #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight in 2025.** The Elite Eight consisted of four #1 seeds, three #2 seeds, and one #3 seed — tied with 2007 as the lowest seed total for an Elite Eight in tournament history. All four #1 seeds then advanced to the Final Four (Florida, Duke, Houston, and Auburn), an occurrence only previously matched by the 2008 tournament.

### Tournament Context
- The 2025 tournament was notably **low on upsets**: only four total upsets occurred (three in the first round, one in the second round)
- No top-four seed lost in the first round
- All 12 games of the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight were won by the higher-seeded team
- The Sweet 16 was composed entirely of Power Four conference teams (SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, ACC) — the first time since the 1985 expansion to 64 teams

### Champion
Florida defeated Houston 65–63 in the championship game, claiming its third title and first since 2007.

### Historical Note
The article explicitly contrasts 2025's result with **2023, when no #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight**, highlighting the significant year-to-year variability in #1 seed performance.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament">
## Summary: 2023 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament

### Key Outcome Relevant to the Question
**This was the first NCAA tournament in history in which all top (#1) seeds failed to make the Elite Eight.** Alabama and Houston (both #1 seeds) were eliminated in the Sweet Sixteen, making 2023 the historic low-water mark for #1 seed Elite Eight performance — **zero #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight**.

The article also notes this year had "the fewest combined 1- and 2-seeds left in the Elite Eight in tournament history, with only 2-seed Texas remaining."

### Notable Upsets Contributing to #1 Seed Failures
- **Fairleigh Dickinson defeated #1 seed Purdue** in the first round (63–58) — only the second time in history a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed
- **#15 Princeton defeated #2 seed Arizona** in the first round

### Tournament Result
- **Champion:** UConn Huskies (defeated San Diego State 76–59 in the championship game)
- **Final Four teams:** UConn, San Diego State, Florida Atlantic (9-seed), and Miami (FL) — notably, **no #1 seeds** participated in the Final Four, only the third such occurrence since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985

### Historical Context Provided
- 2023 was the third Final Four without any #1 seeds since 1985 expansion (previous: 2006, 2011)
- It was the first Final Four in history without any teams seeded 1–3

<Summary source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Eight">
## Summary of "Elite Eight" Article

### Definition
The "Elite Eight" in NCAA Division I men's basketball refers to the **regional finals (Round of 8)**, comprising the final eight teams in the tournament. Winners of these games advance to the Final Four.

### Key Historical Facts Relevant to #1 Seeds

- **On average, three of the four No. 1 seeds make it to the Elite Eight each year.**
- There has been **only one occurrence in history where no No. 1 seeds made the Elite Eight: 2023.**
- The article does not explicitly state how many times all four #1 seeds have reached the Elite Eight, though background context (not from this article) notes all four reached the Final Four in 2025.

### Notable Upsets / Low Seeds Reaching Elite Eight
- Lowest seed ever to reach the Elite Eight in the modern era: **No. 15 Saint Peter's (2022)**
- Two **No. 12 seeds** have reached the Elite Eight (Missouri 2002, Oregon State 2021)
- Ten **No. 11 seeds** have reached the Elite Eight across various years
- Four seasons have seen **two double-digit seeds** reach the Elite Eight: 1990, 2002, 2021, and 2022

### Takeaway for Forecasting
The historical baseline strongly suggests **3 out of 4 #1 seeds** reaching the Elite Eight is the most common outcome, with 2023 (zero) being a notable historical anomaly.

## Summary: Seed Performance Data from Bracketodds (Illinois) – 1985 to 2025

This tool from the University of Illinois tracks historical seed matchup records across 40 NCAA tournaments (1985–2025, excluding 2020), providing round-by-round performance data relevant to bracketology.

### Key Data Points Relevant to #1 Seeds Reaching the Elite Eight:

**Round of 64 (1 vs. 16):** #1 seeds are 158-2 all-time, though performance has statistically worsened in recent years (54-2 from 2011–2025 vs. 104-0 from 1985–2010).

**Round of 32:** #1 seeds perform strongly against both 8-seeds (61-16) and 9-seeds (75-6).

**Sweet Sixteen:** #1 seeds dominate lower seeds — going 44-18 vs. 4-seeds, 39-11 vs. 5-seeds, 20-0 vs. 12-seeds, and 4-0 vs. 13-seeds.

**Elite Eight matchups involving #1 seeds:**
- vs. #2: 27-24
- vs. #3: 18-10
- vs. #6: 8-2
- vs. #7: 4-0
- vs. #10: 5-1
- vs. #11: 4-4

These records reflect how often #1 seeds *appeared in* Elite Eight matchups, indicating they reach this round with considerable frequency historically.

**Final Four:** #1 seeds have met each other 15 times, suggesting frequent deep runs.

### Statistical Trend Note:
The data flags that #1 seed performance in the Round of 64 has been statistically **worse** in recent years (2011–2025) compared to earlier periods, though upsets remain rare.

*No explicit calculation of how many #1 seeds reach the Elite Eight per tournament is provided, but the matchup frequency data implies strong historical advancement rates.*

## Summary: How Do Seeds Perform in the Men's Final Four? (NCAA.com, April 4 & 6, 2026)

### Key Statistical Data (since 1985 tournament expansion)

The article presents a historical seed performance table for the Men's NCAA Tournament:

| Seed | Final Four Appearances | Championship Game | National Championships |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **1** | **66** | **41** | **26** |
| 2 | 32 | 12 | 5 |
| 3 | 17 | 12 | 4 |
| 4 | 15 | 4 | 2 |
| 11 | 6 | 0 | 0 |

*(No seeds 12–16 have ever reached the Final Four)*

### Key Takeaways

- **#1 seeds dominate late rounds:** 26 of 40 national champions since 1985 were #1 seeds. Fourteen of the last 18 title winners were top seeds, **including Florida in 2025**.
- **All four #1 seeds reaching the Final Four is rare:** It has happened only **twice** — in **2008** (Kansas, Memphis, North Carolina, UCLA) and **2025** (Auburn, Duke, Florida, Houston).
- Three #1 seeds have reached the Final Four just five times historically.
- Combined, seeds 2, 3, and 4 have nearly matched #1 seeds in Final Four appearances (64 vs. 66).
- **Cinderella runs are memorable but statistically uncommon**, making them poor bracket picks for deep rounds.

> **Note:** The article references the **2025 tournament** as a recent example (Florida winning the championship; all four #1 seeds reaching the Final Four), confirming this article was published during or after the 2025 tournament, providing context for the 2026 forecasting question.

**Disclaimer:** This article is primarily focused on the 2021 NCAA Tournament bracket strategy and general historical analysis, not the 2026 tournament specifically. Its relevance to the forecasting question is as a source of historical base rates.

---

### Key Historical Statistics Relevant to the Question

**#1 Seeds Reaching the Elite Eight / Final Four:**
- **93% of the time**, at least one #1 seed makes it to the Final Four (failed only in 1980, 2006, and 2011)
- **~54% of the time**, at least two #1 seeds reach the Final Four
- **Three or more #1 seeds in the Final Four** has only happened six times since the Magic Johnson era (rare)

**General Upset Patterns by Round:**
- **Regional Finals (Elite Eight round):** Typically **zero to two upsets** per year, meaning higher seeds usually prevail at this stage
- **Sweet 16:** One to three upsets expected
- **First Round:** Six to ten upsets expected

### Methodology Note
The article uses **Monte Carlo simulations** based on KenPom efficiency ratings and historical Vegas spreads to model tournament outcomes, finding strong alignment between simulated and actual historical upset rates.

### Implication for #1 Seeds in Elite Eight
Given that 0–2 upsets typically occur in the regional finals round, and #1 seeds are the strongest teams, **two to four #1 seeds reaching the Elite Eight** represents the historically normal range.

- #1 seeds are the most popular picks collectively, selected to advance further than any other seed in every round
- Average public Final Four picks feature approximately **two #1 seeds**, one #2 seed, and one #3 or #4 seed
- Public averages picking only **1.08 #1 seeds** to the championship game — barely over one per bracket

**Overvaluation Analysis (since 2011):**
- **#1 seeds:** Averaged **3.18 actual wins** vs. **3.43 expected wins** based on public pick rates (~0.25 win overestimation)
- **#2 seeds:** Averaged **2.14 actual wins** vs. **2.71 expected wins** (~0.6 win overestimation — the **largest gap** of any seed)

### Key Opinions/Arguments (Named Source: Jason Lisk)

- The author argues that bracket participants **artificially impose a quota** on #1 seeds, avoiding picking too many deep into the tournament due to perceived boringness or crowd-following concerns
- When participants force this quota, **#2 seeds become the most common replacement**, making them the most overvalued seed relative to actual performance
- Even if you *knew* the Final Four would include only two #1 seeds, statistically picking **all four #1 seeds** would still yield a higher average number of correct Final Four picks than trying to guess the exact seed/region pairings
- The author contends that #1 seeds are **not as overvalued as commonly assumed** relative to their actual performance, especially compared to #2 seeds

## Summary: Have All 4 No. 1 Seeds Ever Made the Final Four?

**Source: BetMGM** *(Note: This is a sportsbook/gambling promotional blog, so reliability is moderate for factual historical claims but the content appears straightforward)*

### Key Historical Facts:
- It is **rare** for all four No. 1 seeds to advance to the Final Four in March Madness
- It has only happened **twice** in tournament history:
  1. **2008**: North Carolina, UCLA, Memphis, and Kansas all advanced as No. 1 seeds; Kansas defeated Memphis in overtime (75-68) in the championship game
  2. **2025**: Houston, Duke, Florida, and Auburn formed an all-No. 1-seed Final Four

### Broader Seeding Context:
- **Seven of the last eight national champions** were seeded No. 1 in one of the four regions, indicating top seeds frequently win the title even when not all four reach the Final Four
- The article characterizes all-No. 1-seed Final Fours as uncommon enough that bracketologists are generally advised to forecast "a few reasonable upsets"

### Relevance to Forecasting Question:
The article reinforces that while No. 1 seeds are dominant overall, having all four reach even the Final Four (let alone the Elite Eight) is historically exceptional, having occurred only twice across the entire history of the tournament.

<Agent_report>
Query: In NCAA tournaments 1979-2025 how many times did exactly three 1 seeds reach elite eight?
The objective is to determine, for the men’s NCAA Division I basketball tournaments held from 1979 through 2025, how many seasons featured exactly three No. 1 seeds reaching the Elite Eight.  

What the currently-available material does tell us  
1. Since 1979, each tournament bracket has contained four regional No. 1 seeds (exception: 2020, tournament cancelled).  
2. General trends about No. 1-seed performance are documented:  
   •  All four No. 1s have reached the Elite Eight only once in the past 14 tournaments (ESPN, item 14).  
   •  An Elite Eight without any No. 1 seeds has occurred only once—2023 (ESPN, item 15).  
   These facts set broad boundaries but do not pinpoint the exact seasons with “three No. 1s.”  
3. None of the search returns supplies a year-by-year log that cross-references each individual No. 1 seed with its finishing round.  Without that granular dataset, the requested count cannot be derived.  

Why the present evidence is insufficient  
•  The ESPN trend list (source above) cites frequency counts (e.g., “only once”) for 2008-2024 windows but not the specific years.  
•  The Wikipedia and Sports-Reference pages retrieved describe isolated seasons (e.g., 2010) rather than a compiled table.  
•  The NCAA record-book PDFs and comprehensive bracket archives—which traditionally list each regional finalist and its seed—have not yet been located in the provided results.

Information still needed  
For every season from 1979-2025:  
a) the four No. 1 seeds;  
b) whether each advanced to the Elite Eight;  
c) from that, a tally of seasons with exactly three No. 1 seeds in the final eight.  

Because none of the supplied sources contains that consolidated information, the central gap remains the absence of an authoritative, year-by-year data table.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
