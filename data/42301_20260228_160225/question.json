    "description": "The [NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament), commonly known as March Madness is an annual single-elimination basketball tournament held in the United States to determine the men's college basketball national champion.\n\nCulminating each yearly season, 68 teams are selected for the championship tournament based on recent performance, with inclusion partly determined by the [NCAA committee](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2025-01-16/how-field-68-di-mens-teams-picked-march-madness-each-season). Along with inclusion, the committee also determines bracket assignments, with each team receiving a seed based upon its expected ability.\n\nDue to the format of the tournament beginning with regional brackets, four separate teams each receive the No. 1 bracket seed as the top team in their respective region. In [2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament), all top seeds reached the final 4, however in [2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament) none reached the final 8.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":42290,\"question_id\":42077}}`",
