Analysis:
The question is resolved by counting how many of the four regional #1 seeds make the Elite Eight in the 2026 men’s NCAA tournament.  
What we already have: two recent extremes (all four in 2025, none in 2023) and a general description of seeding.  
Information still needed for a solid forecast:

Base rate  
• Full historical distribution (1979-2025) of 0/1/2/3/4 #1 seeds reaching the Elite Eight.  
• Recent trend (last 10-15 years) to see if parity/upsets are increasing.  
• Odds or betting market history for the four vs. zero outcome.

Resolution mechanism  
• Confirmation that the NCAA’s official bracket page or another authoritative source (e.g., NCAA stats database) will list Elite Eight qualifiers on/after 28 Mar 2026.

Key drivers  
• Identity and true strength of the 2026 projected #1 seeds (KenPom, NET, AP poll, Bracketology consensus).  
• Match-up vulnerability factors: injury reports, star-player status, suspension, or stylistic mismatch that historically increases upset risk.  
• Overall parity this season (gap between #1 and #16 seeds, upset frequency during 2025-26 regular season).

Current state  
• Up-to-date Bracketology projections as of late Feb 2026.  
• KenPom / NET rankings and any late-season injuries affecting potential #1 seeds.  
• Conference tournament surprises that might change seeding in the next two weeks.

Contrarian check  
• Articles or analyst takes arguing this is a particularly weak or strong crop of #1 seeds, raising the chance of 0 or 4 advancing.  
• Statistical pieces highlighting how rarely back-to-back years repeat extreme outcomes, or how unusual it is for the same conference makeup to dominate.
