QUESTION:
How many #1 seeds will reach the Elite Eight in the NCAA's 2026 March Madness?

Type: multiple_choice

Background:
The [NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament), commonly known as March Madness is an annual single-elimination basketball tournament held in the United States to determine the men's college basketball national champion.

Culminating each yearly season, 68 teams are selected for the championship tournament based on recent performance, with inclusion partly determined by the [NCAA committee](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2025-01-16/how-field-68-di-mens-teams-picked-march-madness-each-season). Along with inclusion, the committee also determines bracket assignments, with each team receiving a seed based upon its expected ability.

Due to the format of the tournament beginning with regional brackets, four separate teams each receive the No. 1 bracket seed as the top team in their respective region. In [2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament), all top seeds reached the final 4, however in [2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament) none reached the final 8.

## Summary: How the Field of 68 DI Men's Teams Is Picked for March Madness

This NCAA article explains the three-phase process by which the Division I Men's Basketball Committee selects, seeds, and places teams into the March Madness bracket each season.

---

### Phase I: Selecting 37 At-Large Teams
- The committee selects 37 at-large teams (in addition to 31 automatic conference qualifiers).
- Members submit initial ballots listing teams they believe deserve at-large bids.
- Teams receiving sufficient votes are placed on an "under-consideration board," and repeated voting rounds narrow the field until all 37 spots are filled.
- Conflict-of-interest rules require members to recuse themselves from voting on teams they represent or have family ties to.

---

### Phase II: Seeding All 68 Teams
- The committee ranks all 68 teams from strongest to weakest through repeated voting rounds.
- Metrics used include: BPI (ESPN), KenPom, KPI, NET, Strength of Record (ESPN), Torvik, Wins Above Bubble, and NCAA Statistics.
- After initial seeding, a "scrubbing" process allows teams to be moved up or down by simple-majority vote to refine accuracy.

---

### Phase III: Building the Bracket
Key bracketing principles relevant to #1 seeds include:

- **No. 1 seeds are placed first**, assigned to four separate regions. The overall No. 1 seed selects its preferred region and first/second-round site.
- The committee aims for **regional competitive balance**, preferring no more than six seed-value points separating regions.
- **Conference separation rules** prevent teams from the same conference meeting too early (e.g., teams that played 3+ times cannot meet before the Regional Final).
- Teams are kept **geographically close to their home region** when possible.
- Top-seeded teams will **not be placed where they face a significant home-crowd disadvantage**.
- A scheduling constraint ensures not all four #1 seeds are placed at Thursday/Saturday sites — the fourth is moved to a Friday/Sunday site.

---

### Committee Composition
The 12-member committee includes representatives from autonomy conferences and nonautonomy conferences, serving five-year terms. The current chair is **Keith Gill, Commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference**.

## Summary: 2025 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament

### Key Outcome Relevant to the Question
**All four #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight in 2025.** The Elite Eight consisted of four #1 seeds, three #2 seeds, and one #3 seed — tied with 2007 as the lowest seed total for an Elite Eight in tournament history. All four #1 seeds then advanced to the Final Four (Florida, Duke, Houston, and Auburn), an occurrence only previously matched by the 2008 tournament.

### Tournament Context
- The 2025 tournament was notably **low on upsets**: only four total upsets occurred (three in the first round, one in the second round)
- No top-four seed lost in the first round
- All 12 games of the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight were won by the higher-seeded team
- The Sweet 16 was composed entirely of Power Four conference teams (SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, ACC) — the first time since the 1985 expansion to 64 teams

### Champion
Florida defeated Houston 65–63 in the championship game, claiming its third title and first since 2007.

### Historical Note
The article explicitly contrasts 2025's result with **2023, when no #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight**, highlighting the significant year-to-year variability in #1 seed performance.

## Summary: 2023 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament

### Key Outcome Relevant to the Question
**This was the first NCAA tournament in history in which all top (#1) seeds failed to make the Elite Eight.** Alabama and Houston (both #1 seeds) were eliminated in the Sweet Sixteen, making 2023 the historic low-water mark for #1 seed Elite Eight performance — **zero #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight**.

The article also notes this year had "the fewest combined 1- and 2-seeds left in the Elite Eight in tournament history, with only 2-seed Texas remaining."

### Notable Upsets Contributing to #1 Seed Failures
- **Fairleigh Dickinson defeated #1 seed Purdue** in the first round (63–58) — only the second time in history a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed
- **#15 Princeton defeated #2 seed Arizona** in the first round

### Tournament Result
- **Champion:** UConn Huskies (defeated San Diego State 76–59 in the championship game)
- **Final Four teams:** UConn, San Diego State, Florida Atlantic (9-seed), and Miami (FL) — notably, **no #1 seeds** participated in the Final Four, only the third such occurrence since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985

### Historical Context Provided
- 2023 was the third Final Four without any #1 seeds since 1985 expansion (previous: 2006, 2011)
- It was the first Final Four in history without any teams seeded 1–3

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze the question and the pre-research context
2. Identify what information a skilled forecaster would need beyond what's already available
3. Generate 8 search queries to fill the remaining gaps

COVERAGE DIMENSIONS (ensure your queries collectively address these):
- Base rate: Historical frequency, distribution, or precedent for the outcome being forecast. How often has something like this happened before?
- Resolution mechanism: How exactly does this question resolve? What specific data source, metric, threshold, or event determines the outcome? What is the current state of that mechanism?
- Key drivers: The 1-3 most important causal factors that will determine the outcome. What moves this metric or makes this event more/less likely?
- Current state: Latest news, data points, or developments relevant to the question
- Contrarian check: Information that could support the less obvious outcome. What would make the unlikely scenario happen?

TYPE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
- For binary "will X reach Y by Z" questions: Include a query for the historical base rate of X reaching Y in comparable timeframes. Also query the current trajectory/trend.
- For numeric questions: Query for recent values of the metric AND its primary upstream drivers. For financial metrics, query for upcoming scheduled events (data releases, FOMC meetings, earnings) before the resolution date.
- For multiple choice questions: Ensure at least one query is relevant to each substantive option. For catch-all/"other" options, query for the base rate of non-favored outcomes.

AVAILABLE TOOLS (only use tools listed here):
- Google: Keyword search. Write short queries (max 6 words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages. Best for reference pages, datasets, official reports.
- Google News: Keyword search over recent news articles. Max 6 words. Best for breaking news, recent events, and current developments.
- Agent: Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. Write a detailed, multi-part query of up to 3 sentences. Best for complex questions needing synthesis across sources, base rate computation, or multi-factor analysis. IMPORTANT: Use exactly one Agent query, tagged [HISTORICAL], for base rate or reference class research. Do not use Agent for current events.
- AskNews: Semantic (meaning-based) news search. Write a descriptive 1-2 sentence natural language query focusing on the underlying topic, key actors, and context. Include relevant scope: geography, industry, time period. Avoid ambiguous acronyms. Best for finding conceptually related coverage even without exact keyword matches.
- FRED: Federal Reserve Economic Data. Use a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE", "CPIAUCSL") or a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate"). Returns historical data with computed statistics. Only use for economic/financial data.
- yFinance: Yahoo Finance ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "^GSPC"). Returns price history, fundamentals, analyst targets, and options data. Only use for stocks, indices, or ETFs.
- Google Trends: A search term (e.g., "hospital"). Returns 90-day search interest data with base rate analysis. Only use when the question specifically involves Google Trends data.

TAG each query as [HISTORICAL] (for base rates, reference classes, past data, background context) or [CURRENT] (for recent news, latest values, current developments, upcoming events). Aim for roughly 60% historical and 40% current. Include at least 2 of each.

Format your answer exactly as below. Each query on its own line. The source in parentheses, temporal tag in brackets. Do not wrap queries in quotes.
