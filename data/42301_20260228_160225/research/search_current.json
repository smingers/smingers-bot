Virginia, currently a No. 3 seed with a 25-3 record (13-2 ACC) under first-year coach Ryan Odom, travels to Durham, N.C. to play Duke; a victory would boost their resume metrics, potentially overcoming the handicap of a light nonconference schedule ranked 211th in NET strength. Kansas, the highest-ranked No. 4 seed, travels to Tucson to face Arizona as a 9.5-point underdog; a win could elevate them to a No. 3 or No. 2 seed. While Duke and Arizona have significant margins of error and are unlikely to drop from the No. 1 seed line even with a loss, Duke must win to retain the No. 1 overall seed, as Michigan's recent victory over Illinois keeps them in contention. According to CBS Sports Bracketology, the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee prioritizes keeping teams on their natural seed lines over avoiding rematches, though principles suggest avoiding nonconference rematches in the First Four and first round, and conference rematches before the Sweet 16 or Elite Eight depending on the number of prior meetings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 03:18 PM\nSource:[CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-bracketology-ncaa-tournament-no-1-seeds-duke-arizona-virginia-kansas/)\n\n**Texas Tech vs. Iowa State prediction, odds, spread, time: 2026 college basketball picks from proven model - CBS Sports**\nOn February 28, 2026, the No. 4 Iowa State Cyclones (24-4 overall, 11-4 Big 12) will host the No. 16 Texas Tech Red Raiders (21-7 overall, 11-4 Big 12) at James H. Hilton Coliseum for a Big 12 matchup broadcast on CBS and Paramount+ at 4 p.m. ET. Iowa State is a projected No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, while Texas Tech, currently a projected No. 4 seed, recently lost star JT Toppin to an ACL injury for the season. SportsLine's Projection Model simulated the game 10,000 times, projecting a total of 156 points, which is above the sportsbook over/under of 146.5; the model predicts the 'Over' will hit 73% of the time, citing Texas Tech's recent offensive hot streak where they averaged 90 points in their last two games. Additionally, the model indicates one side of the spread hits 60% of the time, though the specific pick is only available on the SportsLine platform. The game odds list Iowa State as 10.5-point favorites.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 02:19 PM\nSource:[CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/texas-tech-iowa-state-odds-prediction-time-2026-college-basketball-picks-february-28/)\n\n**Quick Peek at Arizona's Bracketology Standing Ahead of KU**\nThe Arizona Wildcats are currently positioned as the No. 1 seed in the West Region for the 2026 NCAA tournament according to ESPN's Joe Lunardi, though they aim to reclaim the top overall seed currently held by Duke. This status is set ahead of a critical Big 12 regular-season showdown with the Kansas Jayhawks on February 28, 2026, a game the Wildcats seek to win after suffering their first season loss to Kansas earlier in the year. According to Lunardi, 'results every day matter and can affect teams,' and a victory today followed by a win in the next game could allow Arizona to overtake Duke for the top overall seed. If the tournament began today, Arizona would face Utah Tech in the first round. The article notes that while Arizona is 'firmly in place as a one seed,' the projected field of 68 for Selection Sunday will see 'plenty of movement' before the final bracket is set.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 12:09 PM\nSource:[Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/college/arizona/wildcats-quick-peek-bracketology-standing-ahead-ku)\n\n**SEC Tournament 2026 Schedule and Complete Men's Bracketology Predictions**\nThe Florida Gators are projected as the No. 1 seed in the 2026 SEC Tournament, entering the final stretch of conference play with a two-game lead over Alabama and Arkansas.

This performance has shifted the narrative around the final No. 1 seed, which previously was undecided between several contenders. According to FOX Sports' bracket forecaster Mike DeCourcy, Duke, Michigan, and Arizona remain clear No. 1 seeds, while UConn now stands as the leading candidate for the fourth and final top seed. DeCourcy's projections also place Indiana, TCU, Santa Clara, and VCU as the last four teams in the tournament, while Auburn, San Diego State, Virginia Tech, and USC are the first four teams out. The SEC leads with 10 teams in the projected bracket, followed by the Big Ten and ACC with nine each, the Big 12 with eight, the Big East and West Coast with three each, and the A-10 with two.

As of February 27, 2026, bracketologists on ESPN, CBS, and Bracket Matrix agree on the top four No. 1 seeds: Duke, Michigan, Arizona, and UConn. There is near consensus on the No. 2 seeds as well, with Iowa State, Illinois, and Purdue consistently ranked there; the only divergence lies between Houston (ESPN and Bracket Matrix) and Florida (CBS). With conference tournaments and regular-season games still remaining, the rankings remain fluid. A pivotal upcoming matchup between No. 2 Arizona and No. 4 Iowa State on Monday could serve as a de facto head-to-head battle for a No. 1 seed, assuming both teams defeat Kansas and Texas Tech, respectively, in the upcoming weekend games. This game carries significant implications for seeding, as strong finishes could propel schools upward while poor performances could lead to downward movement in the rankings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2026 04:57 PM\nSource:[Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25401365-march-madness-2026-mens-tournament-schedule-bracketology-predictions-seeds)\n\n**Big 12 Tournament Projects Difficult Path for Colorado**\nThe Colorado Buffaloes are projected as the No. 11 seed in the 2026 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament, based on their current 16-12 overall record and 6-9 mark in Big 12 play. With the team on the NCAA Tournament bubble, they will likely need to win the Big 12 tournament to secure an at-large bid. The Buffaloes have won their past two games, including home victories over Oklahoma State and Kansas State, but face a major challenge in their next game against the No. 3 seeded and No. 5 ranked Houston Cougars. As the No. 11 seed, Colorado would not receive a bye and would play the No. 14 seed Baylor Bears in the first round, followed by a likely matchup against the No. 6 seeded UCF Knights. A deep run would require defeating multiple top-seeded teams. Their resume lacks a signature win, with only one quad 1 victory (over 14-14 Arizona State) and a notable quad 3 loss at home to Northern Colorado. Their quad 1 record stands at 1-8, and they have 13 losses overall, which, combined with poor performance in high-level games, makes an NCAA Tournament berth unlikely unless they win out in the regular season and advance deep in the conference tournament. According to Sports Illustrated, most bracket projections do not include Colorado in the 68-team field.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2026 01:10 AM\nSource:[Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/college/colorado/basketball/colorado-buffaloes-big-12-conference-tournament-seeding-projects-path-ncaa-tournament-bubble)\n\n**Illinois knocking on the door of rare NCAA tournament program accomplishment**\nAs of February 26, 2026, the Illinois women's basketball team is on the verge of achieving a rare NCAA tournament milestone. With two games remaining in the 2025-26 season\u2014against No. 9 Iowa and No. 22 Minnesota\u2014Illinois is projected as a No. 8 seed, potentially facing No. 1 UConn in the second round. A single win in the final two games would significantly improve their NCAA tournament projection, possibly elevating them to a No. 7 seed. This would mark the program\u2019s best seed since 2000, when they were a No. 6 seed, and would be their first top-seven seed since 2000. Since 1978, Illinois has only received a top-seven seed five times in 46 years. A No. 7 seed would also allow them to avoid a matchup with UConn, a dominant team in the 2026 season. The article emphasizes that a 1-1 finish in the final two games is the minimal goal to achieve this rare accomplishment.

The win came after a shocking loss to Portland on February 4, 2026, and allowed Gonzaga\u2019s seniors\u2014Graham Ike, Adam Miller, Steele Venters, Tyon Grant-Foster, and Noah Haaland\u2014to finish their careers on a high note. Jalen Warley sat out due to a thigh injury, with the team aiming to have him ready for the regular season finale against Saint Mary's on Saturday in Moraga. The victory preserved Gonzaga\u2019s strong resume, maintaining their status as one of only five teams nationally with two or fewer losses (28-2, 16-1), ranking No. 5 in the NET and boasting a 6-1 record in Quad 1 games. A win over Saint Mary's would solidify Gonzaga as a near-lock for a No. 3 seed and place them in contention for a No. 2 seed, depending on outcomes in other conference tournaments. Gonzaga has also secured the No. 1 seed in the WCC Tournament, earning a triple-bye into the semifinals. Their semifinal opponent will likely be a Quad 3 team, and even a loss in the WCC final would keep them in the No. 3 seed conversation. The rivalry game against Saint Mary's, set for 7:30 PM PT on ESPN, is particularly significant as it will be the final regular season matchup before Gonzaga joins the Pac-12 in 2026-27.

In the Midwest, Michigan is projected as the No. 1 seed, followed by Connecticut and Gonzaga. Texas Tech remains in contention for a top four seed despite losing All-American forward Isaiah Collier to an ACL injury on February 17, with the team winning two games since (against Kansas State and Cincinnati) and maintaining momentum. In the West, Arizona is projected as the No. 1 seed, followed by UCLA and Virginia, with Nebraska at No. 4. Purdue, after a three-game losing streak in late January, has rebounded with a 5-1 record in February, relying on senior guard Braden Smith\u2019s 49% three-point shooting and 7.5 attempts per game. In the East, Duke is projected as the No. 1 seed, with Iowa State at No. 2 and St. John\u2019s at No. 4. Illinois, previously a No. 2 seed before an overtime loss to UCLA, remains on the 2/3 seed line; their position is aided by Houston\u2019s three-game losing streak, though they face a tough challenge against Michigan on February 26 at State Farm Center. Illinois\u2019 key player, Coleman Hawkins, struggled in the UCLA game with three points, five rebounds, and four assists in 25 minutes. In the South, Houston is projected as the No. 2 seed, followed by Michigan State and Kansas. Florida, after a 5-4 start, has won 16 of its last 18 games, leads the SEC by two games, and features a dominant frontcourt trio averaging 42.8 points, 26 rebounds, 6.5 assists, and 3.3 blocks.

UConn delivered a dominant performance, holding St. John's to just 14 points in the second half and asserting its status as a top-tier 1 seed contender. Florida responded strongly with an 84-71 road victory over Texas, showcasing a formidable offense and positioning itself for a 2 seed. San Diego State improved its tournament chances with an 89-72 win over Mountain West leader Utah State, moving off the bubble. Arkansas surged with a 99-84 win over Texas A&M, while Georgia faced setbacks after an 88-80 loss at Vanderbilt. Gonzaga avenged a prior loss by defeating Portland 89-48, and Santa Clara secured an 86-67 win over a struggling opponent. These results influenced projections for the 68-team field, with several teams now in stronger positions for NCAA Tournament inclusion.

Wilson suffered a fractured hand in a game against Miami two weeks prior and has missed four games. He has averaged 19.8 points, 9.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 1.5 steals per game over 24 appearances, leading the team in all four categories and serving as the team\u2019s primary driver. In his absence, North Carolina has posted a 3-1 record, including a key win over No. 24 Louisville, where Seth Trimble scored a career-high 30 points. The Tar Heels currently sit fifth in the ACC, and securing a top-four seed in the ACC Tournament would grant them a double bye, allowing Wilson additional recovery time. The March 7 matchup against Duke\u2014where Wilson previously helped lead a second-half comeback capped by a Trimble game-winner\u2014represents the most significant stage for his return, with fans hoping for a repeat of past excitement.

The committee handled Texas Tech\u2019s JT Toppin injury with measured caution, avoiding overreaction despite the team\u2019s weakened status. Gonzaga\u2019s ranking was notably affected by their surprising loss at Portland, as the West Coast Conference (WCC) offers limited high-impact games, making seeding challenging. The NCAA\u2019s NET rating system classifies wins into four quadrants based on strength of opponent and game location. Among the 'Last Four In' are Indiana (ranked 43rd in WAB, 4-10 in Q1/Q2, 1-7 in tough road/neutral games), Santa Clara (1-4 in Q1, 7 Q2 wins, key game vs. Saint Mary\u2019s upcoming), TCU (4 Q1 wins, including against Iowa State and neutral wins over Florida and Wisconsin), and New Mexico (2-4 in Q1, win over Santa Clara, Q3 loss to New Mexico State). The 'First Five Out' include USC (2 Q3 losses, injury-impacted roster), Ohio State (0-9 in Q1, all at-home wins vs. at-large teams), VCU (10-game win streak snapped, 1-5 in Q1), Virginia Tech (2-8 in Q1, 6 Q2 wins, tough road games ahead), and California (4 Q1 wins, 1-3 in Q2, metrics around 50th). The conference breakdown shows the SEC with 11 teams, the Big Ten with 9, the ACC with 8, the Big 12 with 8, and other conferences with varying representation. The bracket is based on games through February 23, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 01:48 PM\nSource:[Inside the Hall | Indiana Hoosiers Basketball News, Recruiting and Analysis](https://www.insidethehall.com/2026/02/24/bracketology-ncaa-tournament-projection-as-of-february-24th-2026/)\n\n**March Madness bracket predictions 2.0: Projecting the Field of 68 for 2026 NCAA Tournament**\nThe Sporting News releases its second 2025-26 men's college basketball bracketology, projecting the Field of 68 for the NCAA Tournament. Arizona (23-0) remains the No. 1 overall seed, with Michigan, Duke, and UConn also holding No. 1 seeds for the second consecutive week. Arizona faces a critical test against Kansas (18-5) in a Big 12 showdown, while Miami (Ohio) (24-0) is the other unbeaten team, flexed to face rival Ohio on Friday. The Four Teams In are Santa Clara, San Diego State, Miami (Fla.), and Cal; the first Four Teams Out are Ohio State, New Mexico, Missouri, and Seton Hall. Key resume metrics include KenPom and NET rankings, with Michigan leading in KenPom (1) and NET (1), Duke boasting 10 Quad 1 wins despite a loss to North Carolina, and UConn maintaining a strong position despite a loss to St. John's. Iowa State and Houston are strong contenders for No. 1 seeds, while Nebraska, Michigan State, and Virginia are in the upper tier of the bubble. Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas A&M are in the thick of SEC contention, and Saint Louis (23-1) emerges as a strong at-large candidate. Utah State and New Mexico are key Mountain West teams, and Seton Hall remains on the bubble with a 1-4 Quad 1 record and four Quad 2 losses. The Final Four is scheduled for April 4\u20136 at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 05:58 PM\nSource:[Sporting News](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-basketball/news/march-madness-bracket-predictions-2026-ncaa-tournament/e7ee0df9f3b879d52f035b4c)\n\n**2026 Men's NCAA Tournament Projections: Michigan Reclaims No. 1 seed, ACC Rising**\nAccording to FOX Sports bracket forecaster Mike DeCourcy, the 2026 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament projections feature Michigan reclaiming the No. 1 seed, alongside UConn, Duke, and Arizona. The ACC and Big Ten each lead with 10 teams projected to make the tournament, followed by the SEC (9), Big 12 (7), and Big East (3). The West Coast, Atlantic 10, and Mountain West each have two teams in the projection. On the bubble, Ohio State, George Mason, Cal, and Virginia Tech are the last four teams in, while San Diego State, Missouri, Indiana, and Stanford are the first four out. The projections were updated after a week of dominant wins (Vanderbilt, Iowa State, Alabama), close games (Michigan, UConn, Virginia), and upsets, including Indiana's victory over No. 12 Purdue. Selection Sunday is less than two months away, and projections are expected to shift significantly before then.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 08:06 PM\nSource:[FOX Sports](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-basketball/men-ncaa-tournament-bracket-prediction)\n\n**2026 Men's NCAA Tournament Bracket: Latest Projection of the Field of 68**\nThe start of conference play in the 2026 men's college basketball season has triggered a major reshuffling of the NCAA tournament projection field of 68. On a single Saturday, notable upsets occurred: Kansas lost to UCF, North Carolina to SMU, Florida to Missouri, and St. John's was defeated at home by Providence\u2014marking a classic 'shake-up Saturday.' While these results did not affect the projected No. 1 or No. 2 seeds, they significantly altered the bracket landscape. With league play now underway, projected automatic bids are based on conference records. At this halfway point in the bracketology process, resume metrics (SOR, KPI, WAB) are now carrying more weight than predictive metrics (KenPom, Torvik, BPI), though all metrics\u2014including quadrant records and strength of schedule\u2014factor into seeding. The full bracket, along with analysis of the bubble and top seed line, is presented, followed by a conference-by-conference breakdown of the most significant changes from the previous week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 03:03 PM\nSource:[Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25348444-2026-mens-ncaa-tournament-bracket-latest-projection-field-68)\n\n**2026 Men's NCAA Tournament Projections: Vanderbilt Joins Mike DeCourcy's No. 1 Seeds**\nFOX Sports bracket forecaster Mike DeCourcy released his third edition of the 2026 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament projections on January 2, 2026.

The Big Ten is poised to potentially send 13 teams to the tournament\u2014breaking last season\u2019s record of 12\u2014though performance in November and December nonconference play is critical, as four of those 13 teams (Nebraska, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota) are projected as 9-seeds or lower. A strong nonconference showing, such as Michigan\u2019s win over Notre Dame or UConn, would boost individual r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and collective NET rankings. South Carolina faces a challenge after Chloe Kitts\u2019 season-ending knee injury; the team\u2019s frontcourt depth is thin, with only 6-4 senior Maryam Dauda and 6-5 sophomore Adhel Tac averaging 10.2 minutes per game last season. However, transfers Madina Okot (12 points, 4 rebounds in 17 minutes in season opener) and sophomore Joyce Edwards may fill the void, with Okot\u2019s production key to maintaining South Carolina\u2019s No. 1 seed status. USC is a highly uncertain team, with only sophomore Kennedy Smith returning from last season\u2019s rotation; the addition of transfers Kara Dunn and Londynn Jones and freshman Jazzy Davidson brings talent but significant unknowns, making the Trojans one of the most mysterious teams in the AP Top 25. The SEC remains the nation\u2019s strongest conference, with five teams in the top two seed lines and two\u2014South Carolina and Texas\u2014projected as No. 1 seeds. Upsets by Oklahoma and Tennessee against the Gamecocks or Longhorns could tighten the standings and strengthen their own r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. In the Ivy League, Princeton and Columbia are in position for at-large bids, requiring first and second place finishes and a matchup in the Ivy Madness final. The Missouri Valley could see two NCAA tournament teams for the first time since 2021 if Belmont wins a marquee nonconference game and Murray State claims the conference tournament title.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 01:26 PM\nSource:[ESPN.com](https://www.espn.com/womens-college-basketball/story/_/id/46848719/womens-college-basketball-biggest-questions-impact-bracket-march-madness-2026)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on my research of news reports from late February 2026, I found information about the projected No. 1 seeds for the 2026 NCAA Tournament, but **no significant injuries were reported for these top-seeded teams**.\n\n## Projected No. 1 Seeds (as of February 28, 2026)\n\nAccording to multiple bracketology sources including USA TODAY Sports, CBS Sports, ESPN, and FOX Sports, the four projected No. 1 seeds are [1][2][4][11]:\n\n1. **Duke** \u2013 Currently the No. 1 overall seed following their 68-63 victory over Michigan on February 24 [1][8]\n2. **Michigan** \u2013 Despite the loss to Duke, they remain firmly on the 1-line with only two losses all season [1][4]\n3. **Arizona** \u2013 Leading the Big 12 with key victories over Florida, UConn, Auburn, and Alabama [4]\n4. **UConn** \u2013 Reclaimed the fourth No. 1 seed after a dominant 72-40 win over St. John's on February 23 [1][3]\n\n## Injury Status\n\n**No injuries reported** for these projected No. 1 seeds in the available coverage through February 28, 2026. Duke (26-2), Michigan, Arizona, and UConn (25-3) all appear to be at full strength heading into the final stretch before Selection Sunday on March 15, 2026.\n\n## Notable Injuries to Other Tournament Teams\n\nWhile the projected 1-seeds are healthy, significant injuries were reported for other tournament-caliber teams:\n\n- **JT Toppin (Texas Tech)**: The star forward suffered an **ACL tear** in a game against Arizona State, creating \"challenges\" for the Red Raiders, who are projected as a No. 4 seed [5][9]. The selection committee handled this injury with \"measured caution,\" avoiding overreaction to the team's weakened status [9].\n\n- **Charles Bediako (Alabama)**: The center played in five games under a temporary restraining order before a court denied him an injunction to continue playing for the remainder of the season. Selection Committee Chair Keith Gill noted Alabama was 3-2 with Bediako and 16-5 without him, determining the impact was not \"materially significant\" compared to other injuries [20].\n\n## Context\n\nWith Selection Sunday approaching on March 15, 2026, and conference tournaments beginning, the health of these top four teams will be critical to watch. Currently, Duke holds a slight edge for the No. 1 overall seed after defeating Michigan, while UConn faces crucial upcoming games against Seton Hall and Marquette to solidify their position on the top line [1][4].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
