The overall No. 1 seed selects its preferred region and first/second-round site.\n- The committee aims for **regional competitive balance**, preferring no more than six seed-value points separating regions.\n- **Conference separation rules** prevent teams from the same conference meeting too early (e.g., teams that played 3+ times cannot meet before the Regional Final).\n- Teams are kept **geographically close to their home region** when possible.\n- Top-seeded teams will **not be placed where they face a significant home-crowd disadvantage**.\n- A scheduling constraint ensures not all four #1 seeds are placed at Thursday/Saturday sites \u2014 the fourth is moved to a Friday/Sunday site.\n\n---\n\n### Committee Composition\nThe 12-member committee includes representatives from autonomy conferences and nonautonomy conferences, serving five-year terms. The current chair is **Keith Gill, Commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference**.\n\n---\n\n*Note: This article describes the selection and seeding process only \u2014 it contains no data or predictions specific to the 2026 tournament or historical #1 seed performance in the Elite Eight.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament\">\n## Summary: 2025 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament\n\n### Key Outcome Relevant to the Question\n**All four #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight in 2025.** The Elite Eight consisted of four #1 seeds, three #2 seeds, and one #3 seed \u2014 tied with 2007 as the lowest seed total for an Elite Eight in tournament history. All four #1 seeds then advanced to the Final Four (Florida, Duke, Houston, and Auburn), an occurrence only previously matched by the 2008 tournament.\n\n### Tournament Context\n- The 2025 tournament was notably **low on upsets**: only four total upsets occurred (three in the first round, one in the second round)\n- No top-four seed lost in the first round\n- All 12 games of the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight were won by the higher-seeded team\n- The Sweet 16 was composed entirely of Power Four conference teams (SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, ACC) \u2014 the first time since the 1985 expansion to 64 teams\n\n### Champion\nFlorida defeated Houston 65\u201363 in the championship game, claiming its third title and first since 2007.\n\n### Historical Note\nThe article explicitly contrasts 2025's result with **2023, when no #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight**, highlighting the significant year-to-year variability in #1 seed performance.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament\">\n## Summary: 2023 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament\n\n### Key Outcome Relevant to the Question\n**This was the first NCAA tournament in history in which all top (#1) seeds failed to make the Elite Eight.** Alabama and Houston (both #1 seeds) were eliminated in the Sweet Sixteen, making 2023 the historic low-water mark for #1 seed Elite Eight performance \u2014 **zero #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight**.\n\nThe article also notes this year had \"the fewest combined 1- and 2-seeds left in the Elite Eight in tournament history, with only 2-seed Texas remaining.\"\n\n### Notable Upsets Contributing to #1 Seed Failures\n- **Fairleigh Dickinson defeated #1 seed Purdue** in the first round (63\u201358) \u2014 only the second time in history a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed\n- **#15 Princeton defeated #2 seed Arizona** in the first round\n\n### Tournament Result\n- **Champion:** UConn Huskies (defeated San Diego State 76\u201359 in the championship game)\n- **Final Four teams:** UConn, San Diego State, Florida Atlantic (9-seed), and Miami (FL) \u2014 notably, **no #1 seeds** participated in the Final Four, only the third such occurrence since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985\n\n### Historical Context Provided\n- 2023 was the third Final Four without any #1 seeds since 1985 expansion (previous: 2006, 2011)\n- It was the first Final Four in history without any teams seeded 1\u20133\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Eight\">\n## Summary of \"Elite Eight\" Article\n\n### Definition\nThe \"Elite Eight\" in NCAA Division I men's basketball refers to the **regional finals (Round of 8)**, comprising the final eight teams in the tournament.

Since 1979, each tournament bracket has contained four regional No. 1 seeds (exception: 2020, tournament cancelled).  \n2. General trends about No. 1-seed performance are documented:  \n   \u2022  All four No. 1s have reached the Elite Eight only once in the past 14 tournaments (ESPN, item 14).  \n   \u2022  An Elite Eight without any No. 1 seeds has occurred only once\u20142023 (ESPN, item 15).  \n   These facts set broad boundaries but do not pinpoint the exact seasons with \u201cthree No. 1s.\u201d  \n3. None of the search returns supplies a year-by-year log that cross-references each individual No. 1 seed with its finishing round.  Without that granular dataset, the requested count cannot be derived.  \n\nWhy the present evidence is insufficient  \n\u2022  The ESPN trend list (source above) cites frequency counts (e.g., \u201conly once\u201d) for 2008-2024 windows but not the specific years.  \n\u2022  The Wikipedia and Sports-Reference pages retrieved describe isolated seasons (e.g., 2010) rather than a compiled table.  \n\u2022  The NCAA record-book PDFs and comprehensive bracket archives\u2014which traditionally list each regional finalist and its seed\u2014have not yet been located in the provided results.\n\nInformation still needed  \nFor every season from 1979-2025:  \na) the four No. 1 seeds;  \nb) whether each advanced to the Elite Eight;  \nc) from that, a tally of seasons with exactly three No. 1 seeds in the final eight.  \n\nBecause none of the supplied sources contains that consolidated information, the central gap remains the absence of an authoritative, year-by-year data table.</Agent_report>\n"
