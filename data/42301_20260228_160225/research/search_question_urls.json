The overall No. 1 seed selects its preferred region and first/second-round site.\n- The committee aims for **regional competitive balance**, preferring no more than six seed-value points separating regions.\n- **Conference separation rules** prevent teams from the same conference meeting too early (e.g., teams that played 3+ times cannot meet before the Regional Final).\n- Teams are kept **geographically close to their home region** when possible.\n- Top-seeded teams will **not be placed where they face a significant home-crowd disadvantage**.\n- A scheduling constraint ensures not all four #1 seeds are placed at Thursday/Saturday sites \u2014 the fourth is moved to a Friday/Sunday site.\n\n---\n\n### Committee Composition\nThe 12-member committee includes representatives from autonomy conferences and nonautonomy conferences, serving five-year terms. The current chair is **Keith Gill, Commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference**.\n\n---\n\n*Note: This article describes the selection and seeding process only \u2014 it contains no data or predictions specific to the 2026 tournament or historical #1 seed performance in the Elite Eight.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament\">\n## Summary: 2025 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament\n\n### Key Outcome Relevant to the Question\n**All four #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight in 2025.** The Elite Eight consisted of four #1 seeds, three #2 seeds, and one #3 seed \u2014 tied with 2007 as the lowest seed total for an Elite Eight in tournament history. All four #1 seeds then advanced to the Final Four (Florida, Duke, Houston, and Auburn), an occurrence only previously matched by the 2008 tournament.\n\n### Tournament Context\n- The 2025 tournament was notably **low on upsets**: only four total upsets occurred (three in the first round, one in the second round)\n- No top-four seed lost in the first round\n- All 12 games of the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight were won by the higher-seeded team\n- The Sweet 16 was composed entirely of Power Four conference teams (SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, ACC) \u2014 the first time since the 1985 expansion to 64 teams\n\n### Champion\nFlorida defeated Houston 65\u201363 in the championship game, claiming its third title and first since 2007.\n\n### Historical Note\nThe article explicitly contrasts 2025's result with **2023, when no #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight**, highlighting the significant year-to-year variability in #1 seed performance.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament\">\n## Summary: 2023 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament\n\n### Key Outcome Relevant to the Question\n**This was the first NCAA tournament in history in which all top (#1) seeds failed to make the Elite Eight.** Alabama and Houston (both #1 seeds) were eliminated in the Sweet Sixteen, making 2023 the historic low-water mark for #1 seed Elite Eight performance \u2014 **zero #1 seeds reached the Elite Eight**.\n\nThe article also notes this year had \"the fewest combined 1- and 2-seeds left in the Elite Eight in tournament history, with only 2-seed Texas remaining.\"\n\n### Notable Upsets Contributing to #1 Seed Failures\n- **Fairleigh Dickinson defeated #1 seed Purdue** in the first round (63\u201358) \u2014 only the second time in history a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed\n- **#15 Princeton defeated #2 seed Arizona** in the first round\n\n### Tournament Result\n- **Champion:** UConn Huskies (defeated San Diego State 76\u201359 in the championship game)\n- **Final Four teams:** UConn, San Diego State, Florida Atlantic (9-seed), and Miami (FL) \u2014 notably, **no #1 seeds** participated in the Final Four, only the third such occurrence since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985\n\n### Historical Context Provided\n- 2023 was the third Final Four without any #1 seeds since 1985 expansion (previous: 2006, 2011)\n- It was the first Final Four in history without any teams seeded 1\u20133\n</QuestionSource>\n"
