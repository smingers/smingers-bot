**Evaluating outage rates**

I’m considering past outage data to assess the current situation. For this period, there was a critical workers outage in January 2023. There's a noted 121-minute outage in 2023, which seems critical. We’ll need to analyze the monthly statistics over several years. Given the recent incidents, I might opt for an outside view, focusing on a reference class of Cloudflare’s critical incidents in the past three years, as older data might not be as relevant.**Calculating incident rates**

I need to analyze the incident data over the last 36 months, from March 2023 to February 2026. I’ve noted six incidents during this period, leading to a rate of 0.167 per month. If we were to consider just five incidents, the rate drops to 0.139. I’m debating between an inside and outside view, especially since the clustering of incidents affects the base rate. Maybe I could apply Bayesian shrinkage, balancing the long-term average with more recent occurrences to find a suitable posterior rate.**Calculating posterior probabilities**

I’m working on calculating the posterior probabilities based on the data. After adjusting for additional events, my new parameters give me a mean rate of 0.145 per month. I’ve calculated a probability of about 25.2% for the prediction window of March 1 to May 1, considering a two-month period. While I could adjust for potential clustering or scheduled maintenance, I think maintaining that 25.2% aligns with an outside view. Next, I’ll need to address source analysis and prepare for the final response.
