**Analyzing Incident Factors**

I’m considering several factors indicating potential issues. Recently, there were two critical incidents within one month, which suggests ongoing instability. Cloudflare is rolling out new architecture, which adds risk, particularly due to historical clustering of configuration errors with process changes. Furthermore, expectations from tech articles predict outages as the new norm. With one more critical incident, the probability of risk appears high, especially given the historical incident rate of about one per month.**Evaluating Risk Factors**

On the flip side, after the large outage on February 20, Cloudflare might be implementing a code freeze and stricter controls, which could lower short-term risk. By the end of Q1, the Fail Small initiative will likely be fully deployed, possibly reducing risks by April. Leadership seems highly motivated to prevent further incidents, especially due to stock impacts. Additionally, the criteria for what's classified as a critical incident might limit how many incidents get flagged. Model predictions yield around a 47% probability, factoring in potential limitations in classification.**Analyzing Incident Probability**

I'm considering how to evaluate the likelihood of a "Critical" incident on Cloudflare's status page between February 25 and May 1, 2026. The base probability outside is 34.8%, but my new inside view has it at 47%, indicating an upward shift. Key evidence includes two critical incidents already in February, ongoing internal changes causing instability, and the potential impact of stricter deployment gating. However, dependencies on third-party services could increase risk. If no major changes occur, the final probability adjustment could confidently sit around 46%.
