Used by over 20% of websites, the company's infrastructure covers many of the worlds most popular sites.&#x20;\n\nWhen Cloudflare undergoes significant issues, major portions of the global internet can fail. During both [November](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/18/cloudflare-outage-causes-error-messages-across-the-internet) and [December](https://apnews.com/article/internet-outage-cloudflare-zoom-linkedin-2ac314f7dcd112a63eb12b30afb74a33) 2025, Cloudflare experienced major outages due to internal changes leading to bugs in their system. Although brief, these issues caused massive global disruption, with users being unable to access a wide breadth of websites, including Metaculus itself.\n\nOn [February 4, 2026](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/gx9nbv7l3yqs), Cloudflare experienced a critical incident in which live broadcasts were unable to function. Although limited in scope, this issue severely affected any ongoing broadcasts.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":42284,\"question_id\":42071}}`",
