The primary detailed content covers the **July 14, 2025 outage of Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS Resolver**, with brief mentions of other incidents.\n\n---\n\n### July 14, 2025 \u2013 1.1.1.1 DNS Resolver Outage (Primary Focus)\n\n**What happened:**\n- Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 public DNS Resolver went down globally for **62 minutes** (21:52\u201322:54 UTC)\n- The majority of 1.1.1.1 users worldwide were affected; for many, this effectively made \"all Internet services unavailable\"\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- A **two-stage configuration error** involving service topology management:\n  1. On **June 6, 2025**, a configuration change for a Data Localization Suite (DLS) service accidentally linked 1.1.1.1 Resolver IP prefixes to a non-production service \u2014 no immediate impact, no alerts fired\n  2. On **July 14, 2025**, a follow-up change to that same DLS service triggered a **global refresh of network configuration**, causing 1.1.1.1 Resolver prefixes to be **withdrawn from production Cloudflare data centers globally via BGP**\n\n**Key Timeline:**\n| Time (UTC) | Event |\n|---|---|\n| June 6, 17:38 | Dormant misconfiguration introduced |\n| July 14, 21:48 | Impact begins (BGP withdrawal triggered) |\n| July 14, 21:52 | DNS traffic begins dropping globally |\n| July 14, 22:01 | Alerts fire; incident declared |\n| July 14, 22:20 | Revert/fix deployed |\n| July 14, 22:54 | Service restored |\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- A **BGP origin hijack of 1.1.1.0/24** was exposed during the outage but was **not a cause** of the failure\n- DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) traffic was **largely unaffected** because it routes via domain name (`cloudflare-dns.com`) rather than IP address\n- Cloudflare confirmed this was **not an attack or BGP hijack** \u2014 purely an internal configuration error\n\n---\n\n### Other Incidents Briefly Mentioned:\n- **February 20, 2026:** Cloudflare outage affecting **Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)** customers, with BGP routes withdrawn\n- **February 4, 2026:** Critical incident affecting **live broadcasts**\n- **Late 2025:** Multiple disruptions documented via Cloudflare Radar (cable cuts, power outages, weather, technical problems)\n- A separate **1.1.1.1 CNAME record ordering bug** that broke DNS resolution for some clients is also referenced but not detailed in the extracted content\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/\">\n## Summary: Cloudflare Outage on February 20, 2026\n\n### Incident Overview\nOn **February 20, 2026, at 17:48 UTC**, Cloudflare experienced a service outage affecting customers using its **Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)** service. The total duration was **6 hours and 7 minutes**. Cloudflare explicitly stated the issue was **not caused by a cyberattack or malicious activity**.\n\n### Cause\nThe outage was triggered by a **software bug in a new automated cleanup sub-task** introduced as part of Cloudflare's internal \"**Code Orange: Fail Small**\" initiative \u2014 a program launched after two prior global outages to prevent recurrence. The sub-task was designed to automate the removal of specific BYOIP prefixes pending deletion, but a **faulty API query** (passing `pending_delete` with no value) caused the system to interpret *all* BYOIP prefixes as queued for deletion, systematically removing them along with their dependent configurations.\n\n### Scale of Impact\n- Approximately **~1,100 BYOIP prefixes** were withdrawn from Cloudflare's network before engineers halted the sub-task\n- Out of ~6,500 total prefixes advertised to one BGP peer, **4,306 were BYOIP prefixes**\n- Visitors to **one.one.one.one** (Cloudflare's DNS resolver website) received **HTTP 403 errors** (though DNS resolution itself was unaffected)\n- Affected customers experienced **timeouts and connection failures** across Cloudflare deployments using BYOIP\n\n### Resolution\n- Engineers reverted the change, restoring ~800 prefixes around **20:20 UTC**\n- ~300 prefixes required **manual restoration** by engineers, completed at **23:03 UTC**\n- Some customers could self-restore via the Cloudflare dashboard; others could not due to edge configuration state being deleted\n\n### Contributing Factors\n- The **staging environment** did not adequately replicate production conditions\n- **Mock data** used for testing was insufficient to catch the bug\n- **Test coverage** for this specific scenario was incomplete\n- The cleanup sub-task operated in close proximity to production systems with limited safeguards\n\n### Context\nThis incident occurred while Cloudflare was actively executing its **\"Code Orange: Fail Small\"** initiative \u2014 ironically, the very remediation effort meant to prevent outages introduced the bug that caused this one. The article also references prior incidents including outages in **November and December 2025** and a **February 4, 2026** critical incident involving live broadcasts.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-service-outage-june-12-2025/\">\n## Summary of Cloudflare Outage Article\n\n### Key Incidents Referenced\n\n**June 12, 2025 \u2013 Major Service Outage (Primary Focus)**\n- Duration: **2 hours and 28 minutes**, affecting all Cloudflare customers globally using impacted services\n- **Root cause**: Failure in the underlying storage infrastructure for **Workers KV**, triggered by an outage at a **third-party cloud provider**\n- Cloudflare acknowledged this as a failure on their part, noting responsibility for architectural dependencies on third parties\n- **Not** the result of an attack or security event; **no data was lost**\n\n**Services Impacted:**\n| Service | Impact Level |\n|---|---|\n| Workers KV | 90.22% of requests failing |\n| Access | 100% of identity-based logins failed |\n| Gateway | Proxy, egress, TLS decryption unavailable; some DNS disruption |\n| WARP | No new client connections or sign-ups possible |\n| Dashboard | Most logins unavailable |\n| Challenges/Turnstile | High failure/timeout rates; kill switches activated |\n| Browser Isolation | Existing and new sessions disrupted |\n| Images | Batch uploads at 100% failure at peak |\n\n**Services NOT impacted:** Magic Transit, Magic WAN, DNS, Cache, proxy, WAF\n\n### Other Incidents Briefly Mentioned\n- **February 20, 2026**: BYOIP customers had routes withdrawn via BGP\n- **Q4 2025**: Multiple disruptions from cable cuts, power outages, weather, and technical problems\n- A BGP prefix leak from Miami data center due to automated routing policy error\n- A DNS CNAME record ordering bug affecting 1.1.1.1\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: Cloudflare reliability improvements 2026 initiative\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Google Deploys Merkle Trees and Post-Quantum Algorithms to Secure Chrome Against Quantum Attacks**\nGoogle has unveiled a plan to protect Chrome browser HTTPS certificates from quantum attacks without disrupting internet functionality, utilizing Merkle trees and post-quantum algorithms like ML-DSA. According to Bas Westerbaan, a lead researcher at Cloudflare, which collaborates with Google, cryptographic data resistant to quantum attacks is approximately 40 times larger than current classical materials; while modern X.509 certificates occupy about 64 bytes, a full chain could reach roughly 4 kilobytes if not optimized. Westerbaan warned that 'the larger the certificate, the slower the handshake occurs and the more people remain unprotected,' noting that users are likely to disable new encryption if it slows web browsing. To address this bottleneck, Google Chrome Secure Web and Networking explained that 'Merkle tree certificates replace the cumbersome, serialized signature chain used in traditional PKI with compact Merkle tree proofs.' In this model, a Certificate Authority (CA) signs a single 'root node of the tree' representing potentially millions of certificates, sending only a simplified proof to the browser. This approach aims to keep the data size at approximately 4 KB, matching current lengths, as stated by Westerbaan. The initiative responds to the threat of Shor's algorithm, which could eventually allow attackers to forge classical encryption signatures and compromise certificate logs, similar to the 2011 DigiNotar breach that issued 500 fake certificates for Google and other sites. Google added that the new mode will be part of a quantum-resistant root certificate store, complementing the store created in 2022. As of the report, Cloudflare registers approximately 1,000 TLS certificates and generates the distributed ledger, with plans for CAs to eventually assume this role. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has formed a working group named PKI, Logs, And Tree Signatures to coordinate with key stakeholders on long-term solutions. Google stated in a message: 'We view the deployment of Merkle trees and a quantum-resistant root store as a critical opportunity to ensure the reliability of the foundation of the modern ecosystem.' The company began implementing quantum-resistant key encryption algorithms in Chrome in 2023, including a hybrid key encapsulation mechanism.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 08:17 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/news/1005106/)\n\n**When Power Centralizes in the Frontend Ecosystem  --  Should We Be Alarmed?**\nIn March 2026, a report from DEV Community titled 'When Power Centralizes in the Frontend Ecosystem' analyzes the structural concentration of power in the frontend web development world, specifically regarding Vercel's influence over the React framework and Next.js. The article identifies that Next.js, stewarded by Vercel, surpassed 500 million downloads in 2025. The core concern is the introduction of React Server Components (RSC), a vision originating at Meta but practically implemented and production-ready through Vercel's re-architecture of Next.js's App Router. This convergence has created a scenario where official React documentation heavily recommends Next.js, and the RSC payload format and Flight protocol are optimized for Vercel's infrastructure, creating a 'conflict of interest' where Vercel has a financial incentive to push Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and RSC architectures to drive hosting usage. The article argues that while this centralization is not malicious, it creates systemic fragility and 'gravitational influence' that could narrow the ecosystem. In response, several alternatives are emerging to challenge this dominance: Cloudflare launched ViNext in one week using AI-assisted development, a reimplementation of the Next.js API on Vite that deploys to Cloudflare Workers, with benchmarks showing smaller bundles and faster builds on a 33-route App Router application. Remix 3, scheduled for 2026, plans to shed its React dependency entirely for a Preact-based, web-standards-first model. TanStack Start offers a full-stack alternative with less cognitive overhead and portability. Additionally, Astro, which joined Cloudflare in 2026, released its v6 Beta with first-class Workers support and an 'islands architecture' that delivers zero-JS-by-default performance, allowing for multi-framework component strategies. The article concludes that the frontend ecosystem is resilient, citing historical survival through fragmentation and innovation, and asserts that power becomes problematic only when unchallenged, noting that the current proliferation of credible alternatives is a sign of a healthy ecosystem.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 06:31 AM\nSource:[DEV Community](https://dev.to/ezhil_sivarajsr/when-power-centralizes-in-the-frontend-ecosystem-should-we-be-alarmed-36l4)\n\n**PT BNCT Accelerates Service Improvements Amid Logistics Industry Pressure with 2026 Work Meeting**\nPT BNCT (a container terminal operating at Belawan Port, North Sumatra) held its 'Raker 2026' (Work Meeting) attended by the Board of Directors, management, and leaders of strategic work units to address competitive pressures in the logistics industry. The meeting's main agenda included evaluating previous year's performance, setting 2026 targets, and issuing operational directives aimed at enhancing ship service reliability and the smooth flow of container traffic.

While quantum computers are not yet a practical threat, the preparation window is narrowing. The core challenge involves post-quantum algorithms like ML-DSA, standardized by NIST in August 2024 as FIPS 204, which generate signatures of 2420 bytes\u2014nearly 40 times larger than the 64-byte ECDSA signatures used today. A direct application of ML-DSA would increase TLS handshake overhead by approximately 2.5 kB per connection, causing noticeable slowdowns without immediate security benefits. To resolve this, Google and Cloudflare developed Merkle Tree Certificates (MTC), which allow the packaging of quantum resistance into certificates comparable in size to current ones. In the MTC scheme, a Certificate Authority (CA) groups certificates and signs a single Merkle tree root, with each certificate carrying only a small inclusion proof (a few cryptographic hashes) for verification. This reduces the TLS handshake overhead to roughly one signature, one public key, and the proof, returning data overhead to levels comparable to today's 64-byte Certificate Transparency markers. Cloudflare is currently running a pilot program on approximately 1,000 certificates, while Chrome has implemented experimental support. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has established the PLANTS (PKI, Logs, And Tree Signatures) working group to standardize the technology. This initiative aims to overhaul the entire web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), including Certificate Transparency logs, CA roles, and root stores, potentially rewriting the foundations of encrypted internet before quantum computers pose a real threat. The project's success depends on acceptance by the IETF and adoption by root programs from Apple and Mozilla.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[PurePC](https://www.purepc.pl/ssl-certyfikaty-ietf-plants-mtc-fips-204-lamanie-komputery-kwantowe-google-cloudflare-rozwiazanie)\n\n**New Taipei City Launches Pilot for Enhanced Kindergarten Safety Monitoring with Extended Video Retention to 30 Days**\nNew Taipei City has launched a pilot program called 'Supervision Cloud 2.0' for two public kindergartens to enhance safety monitoring for early childhood education. The initiative, which began in February 2026, aims to evaluate the feasibility and operational needs of cloud-based surveillance systems, including image storage, access procedures, management costs, and data security. While national regulations do not currently mandate surveillance cameras in kindergartens, New Taipei City\u2019s education bureau has requested the central government to consider including them in legal requirements. The city will also extend the video retention period from the current 14 days to 30 days starting in the 2026 academic year. To support implementation, the city will provide annual funding through the 'Public Kindergarten Teaching Environment and Facilities Improvement Plan' and the 'Private Kindergarten Safety Equipment Upgrade Plan' to help kindergartens replace or install surveillance systems. All recordings must be managed in accordance with the 'Specific Guidelines for the Management of Surveillance Video Systems in New Taipei City\u2019s Schools and Early Childhood Education Institutions,' ensuring proper access control, data security, and personal information protection. The pilot is part of broader efforts to improve safety oversight across the city\u2019s 285 public and 830 private kindergartens.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 08:46 AM\nSource:[Liberty Times Net](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/breakingnews/5354313)\n\n**2026 Recommended List of Reliable Express Delivery Management System Brands in China: A Guide to Selection**\nThe article, published on February 28, 2026, by m.tech.china.com, presents a comprehensive guide to selecting reliable express delivery management system brands in China for 2026.

Cox signs agreements to expand oil production and water security**\nUtah Governor Spencer Cox signed two major agreements on February 24, 2026, to expand oil production and enhance water security. In a joint commitment with the Utah Petroleum Association (UPA), state leaders\u2014including Senate President J. Stuart Adams and House Speaker Mike Schultz\u2014pledged to increase refined petroleum production by 23,500 barrels per day within five years, a 13% rise. Gov. Cox emphasized the need for 'big thinking' in response to regional energy declines, particularly California\u2019s planned phaseout of oil extraction by 2045. The UPA agreed to expand in-state crude oil production, invest in fuel storage, advance permitting reform, and strengthen energy reliability. Simultaneously, Utah signed a memorandum with Idaho to collaborate on the Bear River System, a 500-mile watershed spanning Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho. The agreement includes investments in cloud seeding using drones and ground-based seeders to disperse silver iodide or salt into clouds, aiming to increase precipitation. Joel Ferry, executive director of Utah\u2019s Department of Natural Resources, stated the initiative reflects an 'abundance mindset' to boost water availability for agriculture, municipal, and industrial use. The state plans to implement these measures by 2026. UPA President Rikki Hrenko-Browning warned that out-of-state regulatory shifts\u2014such as California\u2019s energy policies\u2014are tightening regional supply, driving up prices. Schultz, R-Hooper, echoed this, stressing that Utah must not let other states\u2019 'poor planning' dictate fuel costs for Utah families.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 02:05 AM\nSource:[Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/politics/2026/02/23/utah-leadership-private-industry-oil-production-increase-water-security-idaho/)\n\n**The year of the AI agents? More outages? Here's what lies ahead for IT teams in 2026**\nIn 2025, major cloud providers including AWS, Cloudflare, and Azure experienced significant outages and cyberattacks, exposing systemic reliance on a few hyperscalers and vulnerabilities in complex IT environments. As a result, 2026 is projected to be the year of the AI agent\u2014autonomous virtual assistants capable of real-time, self-directed task execution to monitor and maintain IT infrastructure. These agents will enable smarter, self-healing architectures by automating checks and balances, reducing human intervention, and improving resilience. To counter ongoing outage risks, organizations will conduct quarterly 'chaos experiments' in production with controlled blast radius to validate disaster recovery plans. Architectural strategies will include isolating critical business domains, adopting domain-driven design, and implementing cross-cloud failover to reduce dependency on single providers. Infrastructure-as-code will enable cloud-agnostic deployments, while strategic workload placement will leverage provider strengths (e.g., AWS for breadth, Azure for Microsoft integration, GCP for AI/data). Legacy systems remain a major risk: only 10% of organizations in government, manufacturing, and finance have no Windows technical debt, creating security gaps, integration fragility, and talent shortages\u2014especially given a projected 100,000 developer shortfall. AI will play a pivotal role in modernizing legacy systems by translating outdated code into natural language, enabling automated migration to modern stacks, and providing real-time coding assistance. AI-driven observability will predict failures via log and business data analysis, triggering preventive actions. AI-powered compliance monitoring will detect drift and recommend remediation. To prepare, IT leaders should map legacy risks, prioritize technical debt reduction, pilot AI agents for routine tasks, implement infrastructure-as-code, run chaos engineering drills, and quantify downtime impacts\u2014such as 25% customer churn from reliability failures\u2014to secure board-level support. These actions will transform resilience from a reactive measure into a strategic advantage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:39 PM\nSource:[TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-year-of-the-ai-agents-more-outages-heres-what-lies-ahead-for-it-teams-in-2026)\n\n**Cloudflare, Google Chrome, and Firefox add HTTP/3 support**\nOn February 2, 2026, Cloudflare, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox announced enhanced support for HTTP/3, the next major version of the HTTP protocol. Cloudflare made HTTP/3 generally available to its customers, allowing them to enable the protocol in their dashboards for domains served through its network. This enables automatic upgrades to HTTP/3 when users with compatible clients visit Cloudflare-hosted websites. Google Chrome Canary added experimental HTTP/3 support earlier in 2026 via the flags '--enable-quic --quic-version=h3-23', which activates 'http/2+quic/99' in developer tools\u2014indicating HTTP/3 in disguise. Mozilla plans to roll out HTTP/3 in an upcoming Firefox Nightly release later in the fall of 2026. HTTP/3 is a complete rewrite of HTTP that replaces TCP with QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), a transport protocol combining TCP\u2019s reliability and UDP\u2019s speed, and includes built-in TLS encryption. This integration aims to improve website loading speeds and ensure encrypted connections by default. Cloudflare, a major CDN powering approximately 10% of all websites, is expected to drive widespread adoption, following its earlier leadership in HTTP/2 adoption starting in December 2015. According to W3Techs, HTTP/3 usage has been growing steadily, though exact adoption metrics are not specified in the article.\nOriginal language: unknown\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:34 PM\nSource:[zdnet.com](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cloudflare-google-chrome-and-firefox-add-http3-support/)\n\n**Cloudflare Launches 'Code Orange: Fail Small' Resilience Plan After Multiple Global Outages**\nCloudflare launched the 'Code Orange: Fail Small' resilience plan in January 2026 following two major global outages on November 18 and December 5, 2025. The first outage disrupted traffic for approximately two hours and ten minutes, while the second affected about 28% of applications behind Cloudflare's network for roughly 25 minutes. Both incidents were caused by rapid, global propagation of faulty configuration changes via the Quicksilver system, which historically deployed updates in seconds. The new plan mandates phased, controlled rollouts using a modified Health Mediated Deployment (HMD) process with staged validations and automatic rollbacks. Configuration changes will now pass through monitoring gates and be deployed gradually to detect issues early. Cloudflare is also improving failure-mode handling across systems to ensure predictable behavior during errors and prevent cascading failures, including establishing sensible defaults that maintain traffic flow even if a subsystem fails. Break-glass procedures and internal tool access are being overhauled to eliminate circular dependencies that slowed past incident responses. Enhanced training and streamlined emergency access protocols aim to accelerate response without compromising security. The initiative is being implemented incrementally, with full deployment of the enhanced HMD process, defined failure modes, and improved emergency access expected by the end of Q1 2026. The outages, which disrupted major platforms like LinkedIn, Zoom, and Shopify, drew significant scrutiny over centralized internet infrastructure risks. While some users expressed frustration, many praised Cloudflare's transparency and commitment to systemic improvements, marking a strategic shift toward cautious deployment and proactive failure containment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/01/cloudflare-resilience-plan/)\n\n**Cloud outages expected to be the new normal in 2026 | TechTarget**\nCloud outages are expected to become routine by 2026, according to a TechTarget report published on January 14, 2026. The article highlights that hyperscale cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Cloudflare experienced multiple major outages in 2025, with AWS alone generating over 17 million Downdetector reports and lasting over 15 hours. These disruptions affected critical services including Netflix, Snapchat, and e-commerce platforms. The article references the July 19, 2024, global outage caused by a faulty CrowdStrike Falcon update, which crashed approximately 8.5 million Windows devices and cost U.S. Fortune 500 companies an estimated $5.4 billion. According to Oxford Economics' survey for Splunk\u2019s The Hidden Costs of Downtime report, downtime costs Global 2000 companies $400 billion annually\u2014$9,000 per minute or $540,000 per hour. Recovery takes an average of 75 days, and stock prices drop 2.5% on average post-outage, with lasting damage to brand trust. Lee Sustar, principal analyst at Forrester, warns that hyperscalers\u2019 shift toward GPU-centric data centers for AI workloads, while aging x86 and ARM infrastructure deteriorates, will likely lead to at least two major multiday outages in 2026. To mitigate risk, cloud solutions engineer Catalin Voicu of N2W (formerly N2WS) predicts a growing adoption of smaller, regional clouds and multi-cloud strategies, including 'shadow cloud' layers using lesser-known providers. He also anticipates the rise of 'invisible' cloud architectures enabled by AI, which will allow real-time failover across providers, regions, and private clouds. Hyperscalers may respond with aggressive marketing, new reliability guarantees, and ironclad SLAs, but Voicu suggests these efforts may be insufficient as alternative strategies gain traction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 01:20 PM\nSource:[TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/feature/Cloud-outages-expected-to-be-the-new-normal-in-2026)\n\n**Software development in 2026: A hands-on look at AI agents | TechT...**\nIn a hands-on demonstration published on January 6, 2026, a developer evaluates AI agents in software development using Cursor's Composer 1 model to build a Premier League top 10 goal scorers dashboard with Streamlit. The agent quickly generated a requirements document, built the app in under a minute, created a Docker container, and implemented features like pass completion percentages. However, when asked to add pass completion data, the agent initially used hardcoded fictional data, citing that the API did not support it. The agent proposed web scraping as a solution, but encountered issues with CloudFlare blocking requests. After multiple iterations, including updating the Dockerfile to include Chrome and fixing overlapping chart bars, the agent successfully integrated live data. Despite the agent's ability to resolve issues, it failed to update the test suite until explicitly requested, and the developer had to verify the data was real. The entire workflow, including revisions, took under 45 minutes\u2014significantly faster than the estimated full workday required manually. The article emphasizes that while AI agents accelerate development by reducing 'glue work,' human oversight remains essential to ensure data accuracy, test coverage, and reliability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 11:24 AM\nSource:[TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/opinion/A-hands-on-look-at-AI-agents)\n\n**Cloudflare (NET) Partners with JD.com to Create an International Platform**\nCloudflare, Inc.

The 'Ausbildungs-Offensive'\u2014a joint initiative by the state and railway companies\u2014has successfully trained 700 new train drivers through the Fokus Bahn program, helping to resolve long-standing issues caused by driver shortages. As a result, train schedules, particularly in the evenings and on weekends, are now more robust, with fewer last-minute cancellations due to staffing issues. In previous years, 5\u20136% of trains were canceled short-term due to staff shortages, but this has decreased notably in 2025. The state had previously reduced the network by 4% in 2024 to align with available personnel, but now that capacity has stabilized, full schedules are being restored. The responsibility for driver training will transition in 2026 from the state-led Fokus Bahn initiative to the VDV Academy. The state will continue monitoring the situation, as about 5% of drivers retire annually. However, major challenges remain due to infrastructure aging: thousands of rail construction projects are ongoing annually in NRW, described as the 'decade of construction sites.' Despite this, authorities emphasize improved communication and alternative solutions to mitigate disruptions. Krischer stated, 'We cannot change construction sites, but we will use all levers we have to make trains more reliable and punctual.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 08, 2025 06:55 AM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-ROUNDUP_Wieder_mehr_Zuege_NRW_Ausbildungsoffensive_wirkt-19280943)\n\n**Google and Amazon Partner to Strengthen Cloud Resilience, Microsoft to Join by 2026**\nFollowing a major outage by Cloudflare that disrupted parts of the internet two weeks prior, Amazon and Google have announced a strategic partnership to enhance inter-cloud connectivity and resilience between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. The initiative aims to improve interoperability and ensure continuous service availability for customers if one platform experiences downtime. Google describes the resulting multi-cloud services as 'naturally resilient,' featuring multiple layers of protection against failures in infrastructure, networks, and software, thereby guaranteeing that critical applications remain online. Amazon emphasizes that this collaboration represents a 'fundamental shift' in multi-cloud connectivity and aims to establish a new industry standard. Microsoft is expected to join the effort with Azure by 2026, according to the company. The move is seen as a significant development in response to growing concerns over the internet\u2019s dependence on a few dominant cloud providers, and the risks posed by concentrated infrastructure.

Ram Sundara Raman, a former Cloudflare intern and now an assistant professor at UC Santa Cruz, shared insights from his 2022 internship project on detecting network connection tampering by middleboxes using passive data. Despite Cloudflare\u2019s vast data\u2014over 45 million HTTP requests per second across 285 data centers\u2014measuring tampering at scale is challenging due to data noise, sampling limitations, and lack of ground truth. The project used a random sample of one in every 10,000 connections, logging only the first 10 inbound packets, which limited detection of later-stage tampering. Challenges included unreliable packet ordering, false positives from DoS attacks and port scans, and interference from Internet best practices like Happy Eyeballs. To validate findings, researchers used known patterns from prior work and signals such as inconsistent Time-To-Live (TTL) values. The team developed 19 tampering signatures that revealed distinctive tampering behaviors across hundreds of networks, including measurable increases in tampering rates. These findings were published via Cloudflare Radar. The project concluded that large-scale infrastructure providers are not omniscient\u2014data must be carefully filtered and interpreted. Future work may combine passive observation with targeted active probing. The experience underscores that while massive data is powerful, extracting meaningful insights requires creativity, rigorous validation, and careful method design. Cloudflare\u2019s data, though extensive, offers only a filtered, sampled, and partial view of the Internet.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[The Cloudflare Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/experience-of-data-at-scale/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on my search of recent news from February 2026, I found several Cloudflare developments related to reliability and infrastructure improvements, though no specific initiative formally branded as the \"Cloudflare reliability improvements 2026 initiative\" was identified in the available sources. Here is what I found regarding Cloudflare's reliability-focused activities in early 2026:\n\n**Major Outage and Response (February 20, 2026)**\nOn February 20, 2026, Cloudflare experienced a widespread service outage affecting major platforms including Steam, Bet365, Uber Eats, Wikipedia, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The incident was caused by a cascading failure triggered by a misconfiguration in Cloudflare's load-balancing algorithm, which redirected traffic to overloaded points of presence (PoPs), causing automated throttling mechanisms to block legitimate requests [19].\n\n**Strategic Partnership with Mastercard**\nIn response to the outage and broader security concerns, Cloudflare announced a strategic partnership with Mastercard to integrate Mastercard's transaction-level fraud detection with Cloudflare's edge security. This collaboration aims to enhance real-time threat intelligence and improve the resilience of Cloudflare's infrastructure against future disruptions [19].\n\n**Post-Quantum Cryptography Deployment (February 23, 2026)**\nOn February 23, 2026, Cloudflare announced it had become the first and only Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platform to fully support modern post-quantum (PQ) encryption standards across all major network configurations, including Zero Trust access, Secure Web Gateway (SWG), WAN-as-a-Service, and the Cloudflare One Appliance [16][17].\n\nThis initiative includes specific reliability improvements: Cloudflare states that its implementation of post-quantum TLS protocols in IPsec enhances both **performance and stability** while preparing network traffic for the quantum era. The company claims the updated platform outperforms legacy systems in speed and stability while future-proofing network traffic [16][17].\n\n**Systemic Resilience Focus**\nThe February 2026 outage has catalyzed broader discussions within Cloudflare about \"rethinking redundancy\" and improving \"systemic resilience\" in digital infrastructure. The incident exposed vulnerabilities in distributed architectures and has prompted what appears to be a renewed focus on fault-tolerant architectures and AI-driven security governance [19].\n\n**Summary**\nWhile Cloudflare has not announced a specific program explicitly named \"reliability improvements 2026,\" the company has initiated significant infrastructure enhancements in early 2026, including the post-quantum cryptography rollout (which explicitly promises stability improvements) and the Mastercard security partnership, both occurring in the immediate aftermath of a major service disruption that highlighted the need for enhanced redundancy and fault tolerance [16][17][19].\n\nIf you are looking for information about a specific internal Cloudflare initiative that may not yet be publicly announced or may be referred to by a different name internally, I would need additional details or context to provide more targeted information.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
