As of January 2026, it serves approximately **21.3% of all websites** on the internet, handling an average of **45 million HTTP requests per second** as of 2023. The company went public on the NYSE in 2019 (ticker: NET).\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Incident History\n\n**Cloudbleed (2016\u20132017):** A major bug leaked sensitive data including passwords and authentication tokens from customer websites for approximately six months.\n\n**November 18, 2025 Outage:**\n- A major global outage caused widespread 500 errors\n- Affected services included Twitter, Spotify, Uber, DoorDash, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, League of Legends, and many others\n- Cloudflare's VPN service (WARP) was briefly disabled in London\n- A Cloudflare spokesperson acknowledged \"a spike in unusual\" activity during the incident\n\n**December 2025:** The article references a second significant outage period (details truncated), coinciding with a record-breaking 31.4 tbps DDoS attack dubbed \"The Night Before Christmas.\"\n\n---\n\n### Scale & Infrastructure Context\nGiven Cloudflare's role as intermediary for over 20% of global web traffic, any critical incident has **outsized global impact**. The company's recent history shows multiple significant incidents within a short timeframe (November and December 2025), suggesting operational vulnerability during periods of rapid expansion and infrastructure change.\n\n---\n\n*Note: The article was truncated before completing the December 2025 outage section, so full details of that incident are unavailable from this source.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/18/cloudflare-outage-causes-error-messages-across-the-internet\">\n## Summary: Cloudflare Outage \u2013 November 18, 2025 (The Guardian)\n\n**What Happened:**\nCloudflare experienced a global outage on November 18, 2025, causing widespread error messages across the internet. Users were unable to access some Cloudflare-protected websites, and site owners lost access to their performance dashboards. Sites including X (formerly Twitter) and OpenAI also reported increased outages concurrently, according to Downdetector.\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Outage reported at **11:48 AM London time**\n- By **2:48 PM**, Cloudflare announced a fix had been implemented and believed the incident resolved, while continuing to monitor services\n\n**Root Cause:**\nCloudflare identified the cause as **a configuration file automatically generated to manage threat traffic**, which grew beyond its expected size and triggered a crash in the software system handling traffic for several of Cloudflare's services. The company explicitly stated there was **no evidence of malicious activity or attack**.\n\n**Impact:**\n- Cloudflare's Warp encryption service was disabled in London as part of mitigation efforts\n- Some service degradation was expected post-incident due to natural traffic spikes\n\n**Expert Commentary:**\n- **Prof. Alan Woodward (Surrey Centre for Cyber Security)** described Cloudflare as a \"gatekeeper\" for internet traffic, noting the outage highlighted how few major infrastructure companies exist \u2014 making failures immediately and broadly visible\n- A **Cloudflare spokesperson** apologized and committed to learning from the incident\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://apnews.com/article/internet-outage-cloudflare-zoom-linkedin-2ac314f7dcd112a63eb12b30afb74a33\">\n## Summary: AP News \u2013 Cloudflare Outage (December 5, 2025)\n\n### Key Facts\n- Cloudflare experienced a service outage on Friday morning (December 5, 2025), bringing down major global websites including **LinkedIn and Zoom**\n- This was the **second major outage in less than three weeks** (following a November 2025 incident)\n- Cloudflare confirmed the issue was **not due to an attack**\n- The cause was identified as **a change to how its firewall handles requests**, which made Cloudflare's network unavailable for **\"several minutes\"**\n- Cloudflare was also investigating issues with its **Dashboard and related APIs**\n- Service was fully restored by the time of the report\n\n### Named Expert Opinion\n- **Richard Ford, CTO at Integrity 360** (Europe/Africa-based cybersecurity firm): Characterized the incident as \"a database change made as part of planned maintenance that just went slightly awry,\" which \"effectively overloaded their systems\"\n- Ford also noted a broader trend: *\"We are seeing the frequency increase as organizations put more eggs in fewer baskets\"* as the scale of operations at companies like Cloudflare, AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure grows\n\n### Context\n- The **November 2025 Cloudflare outage** lasted three hours and affected ChatGPT, \"League of Legends,\" and the New Jersey Transit system\n- Similar configuration-related outages also affected **Microsoft Azure** and **Amazon Web Services** in recent months\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.datayard.us/blog/the-cloudflare-outage-took-down-parts-of-the-internet-heres-what-businesses-can-learn-from-it/\">\n## Summary: Top Cybersecurity Risks for Manufacturers in 2025 (Datayard.us, December 1, 2025)\n\nThis article primarily focuses on the **Cloudflare outage of November 18, 2025**, using it as a case study for cybersecurity and infrastructure risk for manufacturers and businesses.\n\n### Key Facts About the November 18, 2025 Cloudflare Outage:\n- **Started:** 11:20 AM UTC, November 18, 2025\n- **Root cause:** A misconfigured database permission allowed a Bot Management feature file to grow uncontrollably large, overwhelming Cloudflare's routing and proxy systems and causing cascading crashes globally\n- **Services affected:** CDN delivery, DNS, WAF, Access, Workers KV (caching), and the Cloudflare Dashboard\n- **Duration:** Approximately **six hours** of widespread disruption\n- **Initial misdiagnosis:** Early diagnostics suggested a possible malicious attack; Cloudflare later confirmed it was an internal misconfiguration, not a security event\n- **Recovery:** Services restored gradually, with impact varying by region and setup\n\n### Named Source Opinion:\n- **Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince** stated: *\"An outage like today is unacceptable... On behalf of the entire team at Cloudflare, I would like to apologize for the pain we caused the Internet today.\"*\n\n### Cloudflare's Identified Areas for Improvement (per their postmortem):\n- More robust file size validation for features like Bot Management\n- Stronger observability and diagnostic tools\n- Improved safeguards and testing before global configuration rollouts\n\n### Broader Takeaways Offered by Datayard:\n- Major provider outages are described as **relatively rare** but high-impact due to centralized dependency\n- The article recommends resilience planning, vendor diversification, and failover testing rather than abandoning Cloudflare\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/\">\n## Summary of Cloudflare Status Page Content\n\n**Note:** The extracted content appears to be a mix of incident updates and scheduled maintenance notices, without clear severity classifications (e.g., \"critical\" labels) visible in the extracted text.\n\n### Active/Recent Incidents\n\n**Incident 1: Newark, NJ Elevated Latency (Feb 16\u201327, 2026)**\n- **Started:** Feb 16, 2026 at 10:19 UTC\n- **Nature:** Elevated latency affecting a subset of HTTP requests in the Newark, NJ datacenter; some customers using Cloudflare's **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** suite experienced intermittent errors\n- **Progress:** Issue identified Feb 16; fix implemented and monitoring began Feb 26 at 10:12 UTC\n- **Resolution update:** Feb 26\u201327 confirmed DLP services were **not impacted** by the incident; monitoring continued through Feb 27 at 13:40 UTC\n\n**Incident 2: Peering Authentication Outage (Feb 27, 2026)**\n- **Started:** Feb 27, 2026 at 02:27 UTC\n- **Nature:** Issue impacting customers/peers using `peering.cloudflare.com`; authentication affected due to an **outage with a third-party authentication provider**\n- **Scope:** Did **not** affect serving of cached files via Cloudflare CDN or other edge security features\n- **Status:** Under investigation as of Feb 27 at 13:24 UTC; fix being worked on\n\n### Scheduled Maintenance (Upcoming)\nMultiple datacenters have scheduled maintenance windows, with possible traffic rerouting and latency increases:\n- **BOG (Bogot\u00e1):** Mar 3, 15:00\u201320:00 UTC\n- **TLL (Tallinn):** Mar 3\u20134\n- **LIS (Lisbon):** Mar 4\n- **GRU (S\u00e3o Paulo):** Mar 5\n- **YYZ (Toronto):** Mar 6\n- **PDX (Portland):** Mar 9\u201312 (multi-day windows, 14:00\u201323:59 UTC each day)\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary query=\"site:cloudflarestatus.com \"[Critical]\" 2023\">No URLs returned from Google.</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.itpro.com/infrastructure/networking/cloudflare-outage-explained-what-happened-who-was-impacted-and-how-was-it-resolved\">\n## Summary: Cloudflare Outage \u2013 February 21, 2026 (IT Pro, February 23, 2026)\n\n### What Happened\nCloudflare experienced a **major outage lasting six hours and seven minutes** that affected customers using its **Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)** service. A bug in a configuration change caused Cloudflare to **unintentionally withdraw customer IP prefixes via BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**, making affected services and applications unreachable from the internet.\n\n### Technical Details\n- The problematic change was intended to **automate the manual removal of prefixes** from the BYOIP service, part of Cloudflare's internal \"Code Orange: Fail Small\" initiative.\n- A **regularly running sub-task queried the API with a bug**, triggering the unintended withdrawals.\n- Affected customers experienced **\"BGP Path Hunting\"**, where connections traversed networks searching for routes until timing out.\n- Visitors to Cloudflare's **1.1.1.1 DNS resolver website** encountered HTTP 403 errors, though DNS resolution itself was unaffected.\n- Approximately **1,100 prefixes were withdrawn** \u2014 roughly **a quarter of all BYOIP prefixes**.\n\n### Impact\nNotable affected services included **Uber, Workday, Minecraft, Wikipedia, and Microsoft Outlook**. Betting site Bet365 also publicly acknowledged disruption.\n\n### Resolution & Response\n- Cloudflare reversed the change, and some customers restored service independently via the Cloudflare dashboard.\n- Cloudflare acknowledged the \"unacceptably large blast radius\" and committed to improving staged testing and correctness checks in its Addressing API.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://controld.com/blog/biggest-cloudflare-outages/\">\n## Summary of Cloudflare Outage History Article\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be truncated, cutting off mid-sentence during the description of the January 2023 incident. The summary below reflects only what was available.\n\n---\n\n### Key Facts and Historical Incidents\n\n**November 18, 2025 (Most Recent Major Outage)**\n- Described as Cloudflare's **worst outage since 2019**\n- Affected roughly **1 in 5 webpages** and **1/3 of the world's 10,000 most popular websites**\n- Major services impacted: X/Twitter, ChatGPT, Spotify, Canva, Zoom, Coinbase, Downdetector\n- **Root cause:** A database permissions change in the Bot Management system caused a machine-learning feature file to grow abnormally large, crashing the core proxy software and generating HTTP 5xx errors\n- Duration: ~11:20 UTC to ~14:30 UTC for core restoration; full cleanup by ~17:06 UTC\n- Cloudflare committed to better configuration file validation and additional kill switches\n\n**Other Notable Historical Outages:**\n- **June 2019:** BGP routing issue via Verizon/DQE (~3 hours; affected Amazon, Google, Facebook)\n- **July 2020:** Router misconfiguration in Atlanta (~1 hour; affected Shopify, Discord)\n- **August 2020:** CenturyLink ISP fault (affected Hulu, Xbox Live)\n- **June 2022:** Critical P0 incident lasting ~90 minutes (affected Fitbit, Peloton)\n- **January 2023:** 121-minute outage affecting Workers Platform and Zero Trust (article truncated)\n\n### General Context\nThe article frames Cloudflare outages as **recurring but typically brief**, often caused by internal configuration errors or upstream provider failures. Each incident tends to have **broad global impact** given Cloudflare's role serving over 20% of websites.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/why-reliability-is-hard-at-scale\">\n## Article Summary: Infrastructure Outage Postmortems at Scale\n\n**Note:** This article focuses primarily on Heroku, Google Cloud, and Neon outages \u2014 it does not directly discuss Cloudflare incidents. Its relevance to the forecasting question is indirect, as it provides context about the frequency and nature of critical infrastructure failures at large-scale providers.\n\n---\n\n### Key Findings\n\n**Heroku's Major Outage (Primary Focus):**\n- Heroku suffered what appears to be its **longest-ever outage**, with a timeline revealing significant operational failures:\n  - 8 hours to publicly acknowledge the global outage\n  - 11 hours to isolate the issue\n  - **23 hours to fully resolve** the outage\n  - 5 days to publish a postmortem\n- **Root cause:** An automated Ubuntu 22.04 OS update triggered a `systemd` upgrade, which restarted `systemd-networkd`, flushing IP routing rules and severing outbound network connectivity for all affected dynos (virtual machines)\n- Heroku's own internal tools and status page ran on the same affected infrastructure, **severely hampering their ability to respond and communicate**\n\n**Striking Historical Parallel (Objective Fact):**\n- The article identifies that Heroku's outage appears to have had an **almost identical root cause** to Datadog's largest-ever outage in 2023:\n  - Same OS: Ubuntu 22.04\n  - Same process: systemd\n  - Same failure mode: restart clearing networking routes\n- This suggests Heroku did not learn from a publicly documented prior incident\n\n**Google Cloud:**\n- A globally replicated configuration change triggered a **worldwide outage**\n- Article notes that \"failing open\" and using feature flags for risky updates could have reduced outage duration by approximately two-thirds\n\n**Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL):**\n- Suffered typical PostgreSQL failure modes at scale, including **query plan drift and slow vacuum**, despite being PostgreSQL specialists\n\n---\n\n### Broader Thematic Observations (Article Authors' Opinions)\n- The article argues Heroku's handling \"bears the hallmarks of a company that has gone from being obsessed with reliability... to it being a backseat issue\"\n- Heroku's postmortem was described as a **\"word salad\" with few specifics**, contrasting with more transparent postmortems from other providers\n- The article frames these outages as educational opportunities, noting that **failure to learn from others' documented incidents is a real and demonstrated risk**\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/fail-small-resilience-plan/\">\n## Summary: Cloudflare's \"Code Orange: Fail Small\" Resilience Plan\n\n### Context & Recent Incidents\nCloudflare experienced **two major global outages** in late 2025:\n- **November 18, 2025**: Network failures lasting approximately **2 hours and 10 minutes**\n- **December 5, 2025**: Network failures affecting **28% of applications** for approximately **25 minutes**\n- **February 20, 2026**: A separate incident where BYOIP (Bring Your Own IP) customers had their BGP routes withdrawn\n\nBoth 2025 incidents followed the same pattern: **instantaneous global deployment of a configuration change** that caused cascading failures. The November incident stemmed from an automatic Bot Management classifier update; the December incident was triggered by a security tool change deployed to address a React framework vulnerability.\n\n### Root Cause Identified\nThe core problem was a **disparity between how Cloudflare handles software updates vs. configuration changes**:\n- **Software updates**: Deployed through controlled, monitored rollouts with multiple gates, starting with employee traffic, then progressively wider audiences, with automatic rollback capability\n- **Configuration changes**: Deployed **instantly and globally** via a system called **Quicksilver**, reaching 90% of servers within seconds \u2014 with no equivalent staged rollout or automatic rollback\n\n### The \"Code Orange\" Response\nCloudflare declared a **\"Code Orange\"** \u2014 a designation used only once previously \u2014 meaning this work is **prioritized above all other work** company-wide, with cross-functional teams pausing other projects. The plan is called **\"Fail Small\"**, organized into **three main workstreams** (not fully detailed in the extracted content), with iterative improvements rather than a single large change.\n\n**Key planned changes include:**\n1. **Controlled configuration rollouts via Quicksilver**: Treating configuration changes the same as code releases, with staged geographic and population-based deployment\n2. **Health Mediated Deployment (HMD) for configurations**: Applying the existing software deployment framework \u2014 which requires teams to define success/failure metrics, rollout plans, and automatic rollback triggers \u2014 to configuration changes as well\n3. **Improved isolation**: Preventing errors in one part of the network from cascading into the broader technology stack, including the customer-facing control plane\n\n### Stated Goals\nCloudflare explicitly states they are **\"deeply embarrassed\"** by the incidents and expect that by the end of Code Orange, their network will be **\"much more resilient\"** to the types of issues that caused the recent global incidents.\n\n---\n*Note: The article extract appears to be cut off before fully describing all three Code Orange workstreams and some technical details.
