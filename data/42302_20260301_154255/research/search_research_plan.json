  "plan_analysis": "The pre-research context documents three recent Cloudflare critical incidents (Nov 18 2025, Dec 5 2025, Feb 4 2026) and gives a qualitative sense that configuration pushes and large-scale DDoS traffic were proximate causes. \nWhat\u2019s missing for a well-calibrated forecast:\n\n1. Base rate\u2028   \u2022 How often has Cloudflare tagged an event as \u201cCritical\u201d on its status page in prior years?\u2028   \u2022 Are the three late-2025/early-2026 incidents an anomaly or part of a trend?\n\n2. Resolution mechanics\u2028   \u2022 Confirmation of how \u201cCritical\u201d is defined/colored and whether any incidents are ongoing or recently closed since 25 Feb 2026.\n\n3. Key drivers\u2028   \u2022 Frequency of large planned changes/maintenance windows through Apr 2026.\u2028   \u2022 External threat environment (very-large DDoS attacks).\u2028   \u2022 Evidence Cloudflare is instituting new reliability or \u201cchange freeze\u201d policies that would reduce risk.\n\n4. Current state\u2028   \u2022 Any incidents logged after 25 Feb 2026.\u2028   \u2022 Official post-mortem for the Feb 4 2026 incident (to gauge whether root cause is now mitigated).\n\n5. Contrarian check\u2028   \u2022 Announcements of major reliability overhauls or operational freezes that could make another critical incident unlikely despite the recent streak.\n\nThe search strategy below covers these dimensions: five HISTORICAL queries (base rate, drivers) and three CURRENT queries (latest incidents, planned changes, mitigation efforts). One HISTORICAL query uses the Agent for structured base-rate extraction.",
