**Summary**: The evidence base is exceptionally strong. Multiple high-quality, named Colombian government officials and institutions (Registraduría, Interior Minister, Attorney General, CNE) have confirmed the March 8, 2026 election date. Overseas voting has already begun (March 2-8 window). The ELN declared a specific ceasefire to accommodate the election. All logistical preparations are complete.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong Evidence (large confidence toward Yes):**
- **Multiple independent, reliable, named sources confirming March 8 election date**: At least 15+ independent sources from government institutions, major Colombian media, and international wire services all confirm March 8, 2026 as election day. This is the strongest possible corroboration.
- **Overseas voting already underway**: The March 2-8 overseas voting window means the electoral process has literally already begun as of today (March 1). This makes postponement of the domestic March 8 vote extraordinarily difficult logistically and legally.
- **Government implementation of election-day measures**: Dry law announced by Interior Minister (March 7-9), border closures planned, security deployment of 50,000 personnel under "Plan Democracia" — these are concrete, irreversible preparations.
- **ELN ceasefire specifically for the election**: The ELN declared a ceasefire from March 7-10 to allow the election to proceed. This signals even armed actors have accommodated the election timeline.
- **Historical record**: Colombia has held every congressional election on schedule since 1991 (9/9 = 100%).
- **Constitutional mandate**: The second Sunday of March is constitutionally mandated; changing this requires extraordinary legal action.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Software auditing and testing completed**: Pre-count tests (Feb 7, 21), tally tests (Feb 23-24), E-14 digitalization tests (Feb 26, 28) all completed — showing the process is irreversibly advanced.
- **International observers deployed**: EU, OAS, Carter Center, CAPEL all engaged for March 8 — hard to reschedule.

**Weak Evidence against Yes:**
- **President Petro's criticisms of electoral process**: Petro raised concerns about software and electoral integrity. However, the Registrar and Attorney General both dismissed these concerns, and there is no indication Petro has the power or intention to postpone the election unilaterally.
- **Security concerns in 208 municipalities**: High-risk areas exist, but security forces are deployed and the Registraduría confirmed no polling station relocations.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

Today is March 1, 2026. The election is scheduled for March 8, 2026 — 7 days away. The resolution cutoff is March 9, 2026.

- **If the timeframe were halved (3-4 days)**: Confidence would increase marginally — even less time for disruption, and overseas voting is already underway.
- **If the timeframe were doubled (14 days)**: Confidence would decrease slightly — more time for unforeseen events, but still very high given the advanced state of preparations.

The 7-day window is extremely short. The electoral machinery is already in motion (overseas voting started March 2). A postponement at this stage would be unprecedented and would require extraordinary circumstances.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate is 97.5% (adjusted from 100% historical record to account for tail risks). The inside view, incorporating current evidence, strongly reinforces this estimate:

1. **Overseas voting has already begun** (March 2-8 window for Colombians abroad). This is perhaps the most compelling factor — the election is literally already happening for 1.25 million overseas voters. Postponing the domestic March 8 vote would create a constitutional crisis and logistical nightmare.

2. **All logistical preparations are complete and irreversible**: 860,000 election jurors assigned, 127,000 voting stations prepared, biometric systems deployed, international observers in place, dry law announced, security forces deployed.

3. **ELN ceasefire**: The ELN's specific accommodation of the election timeline removes one of the most plausible security-based postponement scenarios.

4. **No signals of postponement**: Despite Petro's criticisms of the electoral process, there is zero indication from any source that postponement is being considered. The Attorney General, Registrar, and other institutions are actively defending the process.

5. **Constitutional rigidity**: Changing the election date would require extraordinary legal action that has never occurred in Colombia's post-1991 democratic history.

The inside view probability should be at least as high as the outside view (97.5%), and arguably slightly higher given the confirmation that overseas voting has already begun. I'll set it at **98.5%**.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view base rate is 97.5%. Current evidence strongly reinforces this:
- Overseas voting already underway (strongest factor pushing toward 99%)
- Complete logistical preparations (reinforcing)
- ELN ceasefire (reinforcing)
- No signals of postponement (reinforcing)
- Petro's criticisms (very minor factor, insufficient to move needle significantly)

The remaining ~1.5% accounts for:
- Catastrophic natural disaster (earthquake, major flooding)
- Unprecedented security collapse
- Constitutional/legal emergency
- Other black swan events

Given that overseas voting has literally already begun, I'll adjust upward slightly to **98.5%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Colombia's 2026 parliamentary election day occur before March 9, 2026? Election must be held between March 1-8, 2026.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 97.5% (Colombia has held 9/9 congressional elections on schedule since 1991; adjusted for tail risks).

3. **Consistency check**: "98.5 out of 100 times, Colombia's March 8, 2026 parliamentary election occurs before March 9, 2026." ✓ This aligns perfectly — overseas voting has already begun, all preparations are complete, and no postponement signals exist.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - Overseas voting window (March 2-8) has already begun as of today ✓
   - Interior Minister announced dry law for March 7-9, confirming March 8 election ✓
   - ELN declared ceasefire specifically for March 8 election ✓
   - 15+ independent named sources confirm March 8 date ✓
   - Colombia's 100% historical record of on-schedule congressional elections ✓

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: President Petro uses emergency powers to suspend the election citing electoral fraud concerns. This is theoretically possible but would be unconstitutional and face immediate legal challenge. Probability: <0.5%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: The election proceeds on March 8 as scheduled. This is the status quo — all preparations are complete, overseas voting has begun, and no disruption signals exist.

Probability: 98%
