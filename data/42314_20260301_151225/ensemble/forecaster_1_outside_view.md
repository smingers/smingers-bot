Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Wikipedia – 2026 Colombian Parliamentary Election**: Directly states the election is scheduled for March 8, 2026. This is a high-quality, directly relevant source. The ELN ceasefire declaration specifically to allow the election to proceed is a strong corroborating signal.

2. **WTOP News (AP), February 23, 2026**: A credible news wire (AP) explicitly confirms the March 8 election date and describes active preparations (candidates competing, primaries being held simultaneously). High quality, very recent, directly relevant.

3. **Agent Report – Historical Colombian Elections 1990-2022**: Comprehensive historical analysis showing Colombia has never postponed a national congressional election since 1991 Constitution. Every election was held on the constitutionally mandated second Sunday of March. This is extremely relevant for establishing the base rate. The agent report cites IPU, Wikipedia, Registraduría, and other sources.

4. **Georgetown PDBA, IDEA, ABC News, CNBC, Wikipedia Venezuela, Fair Observer, Electoral Integrity Project, ConstitutionNet, List of Annulled Elections**: These sources are either irrelevant to the specific question or provide only general background. They don't affect the forecast materially.

5. **Wikipedia – Congress of Colombia**: Confirms structural details but no specific 2026 date information.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are applicable:

- **Colombian congressional elections held on schedule (1990-2022)**: 9 elections, 0 postponements (100% held on schedule). This is the most directly relevant reference class.
- **Latin American elections held on schedule**: Broader class, generally high compliance with scheduled dates in established democracies.
- **Elections held during active conflict**: Colombia held elections in 2002 during intense FARC activity with only local disruptions; no national postponement.
- **Elections postponed due to security concerns**: Globally rare for established democracies; Colombia specifically has never done this nationally.

The most suitable reference class is Colombian congressional elections 1990-2022: 9/9 held on schedule = 100% base rate.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

Today is March 1, 2026. The election is scheduled for March 8, 2026 — exactly 7 days away. The resolution cutoff is March 9, 2026. 

The question is essentially: will the election proceed as scheduled in the next 7 days? Given:
- The election is already confirmed scheduled for March 8
- ELN declared a ceasefire specifically to allow it to proceed
- Active campaign activities are underway (primaries being held simultaneously)
- Registraduría has published the electoral calendar
- Colombia has a 36-year unbroken record of holding congressional elections on schedule

The window for disruption is extremely narrow (7 days), and the logistical machinery is already in motion.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view is overwhelmingly favorable for a "Yes" resolution:

1. **Perfect historical record**: Colombia has held every congressional election on the constitutionally mandated date since 1991 — 9 consecutive elections with 0 postponements.
2. **Legal rigidity**: The Colombian Constitution mandates the second Sunday of March; changing this requires statutory reform or emergency decree subject to Constitutional Court review.
3. **Active preparations confirmed**: As of February 23, 2026 (8 days ago), credible news sources confirm the election is proceeding with candidates competing and simultaneous primaries scheduled.
4. **Security mitigation**: The ELN ceasefire specifically to allow voting is a strong signal that even armed actors are accommodating the election.
5. **Short remaining window**: With only 7 days until election day, a postponement would require an extraordinary, unprecedented event.
6. **No signals of postponement**: None of the sources hint at any legal challenge, emergency, or political crisis that might delay the election.

The only realistic scenarios for "No" resolution would be: a catastrophic natural disaster, a coup, or an unprecedented security collapse — all extremely low probability given current context.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate from the reference class is 100% (9/9 elections held on schedule). However, I should not assign 100% probability due to:
- Tail risks (natural disaster, coup, extraordinary security collapse)
- The general principle that no event should be assigned 100% probability
- Historical global rate of election postponements even in stable democracies (very low, perhaps 1-2% per election cycle)

Given the 7-day window, active preparations underway, ELN ceasefire, perfect historical record, and no signals of disruption, the probability should be very high — around 97-98%.

The remaining ~2-3% accounts for genuinely catastrophic tail risks that cannot be entirely ruled out.

Outside View Prediction:
97.5%
