**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence (large weight toward YES):**
- Multiple independent, named Colombian government officials (National Registrar Penagos, Interior Minister Benedetti, Attorney General Eljach) all confirming March 8 election date as of late February 2026 – this is institutional confirmation at the highest level.
- Full logistical deployment: 860,000 jurors, 50,000 security personnel, dry law decreed, border closures planned, source code frozen – these are irreversible operational commitments indicating the election will proceed.
- ELN ceasefire specifically timed for March 7–10 to accommodate the election – even armed groups are organizing around the March 8 date.
- Historical record: 0/19 Colombian national elections postponed since 1991 (base rate ~95% from Laplace).
- The question asks whether the election occurs BEFORE March 9, 2026 – the scheduled date of March 8 satisfies this criterion.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Some controversy around electoral software integrity (Petro's criticisms, Benedetti's questions) – but the Registraduría has responded and no legal challenge has succeeded in blocking the vote.
- Security concerns in 208 municipalities – but "Plan Democracia" with 50,000 personnel is deployed, and no polling station relocations are planned.

**Weak evidence against:**
- President Petro's criticisms of the electoral process could theoretically escalate, but no credible mechanism for last-minute postponement is identified.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

Today is March 1, 2026. The election is scheduled for March 8, 2026 – 7 days away. The question resolves March 9, 2026.

At this point, the election is essentially happening. All logistical, legal, and security preparations are finalized. A postponement within 7 days would require an extraordinary event (massive natural disaster, constitutional crisis, Supreme Court injunction) that would have to materialize and be acted upon almost immediately.

If the timeframe were halved (3-4 days), my probability would increase slightly further (~98%) as even less time remains for disruption. If the timeframe were doubled (14 days), I would still be at ~96-97% given the institutional momentum, but there would be marginally more time for an unexpected disruption.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate of 93% (Laplace on 19 cases) was already high. The inside view evidence overwhelmingly pushes this higher:

1. **Operational irreversibility**: With 860,000 jurors mobilized, 50,000 security forces deployed, dry law decreed, and border closures scheduled, the election is operationally committed. These are not reversible on 7 days' notice without extraordinary circumstances.

2. **Institutional consensus**: Every major Colombian institution (Registraduría, Attorney General, Procuraduría, Contraloría, Interior Ministry) is actively managing the election. There is no indication any institution is seeking postponement.

3. **Even adversaries are accommodating**: The ELN – a guerrilla group that has historically disrupted elections – is declaring a ceasefire. This is strong evidence that the election will proceed.

4. **No legal challenge**: Despite Petro's criticisms of electoral software, no court has issued an injunction. The Constitutional Court has not intervened.

5. **7-day window**: The extremely short remaining timeframe dramatically reduces the probability of any disruption materializing and being acted upon.

The only realistic scenarios for NO resolution would be: (1) a catastrophic natural disaster affecting the entire country, (2) a constitutional crisis/coup, or (3) a sudden massive security breakdown. None of these are indicated by current evidence. I estimate these scenarios collectively at ~1-2% probability.

**Probability calibration**

Starting from 93% outside view, the inside view evidence strongly pushes upward:
- Operational deployment (irreversible): +3%
- Institutional consensus at highest levels: +1%
- ELN ceasefire accommodation: +0.5%
- 7-day window (minimal time for disruption): +1%
- Residual risk (natural disaster, constitutional crisis, unforeseen event): -1%

Final inside view: ~97-98%

I'll settle at **97%**, reflecting near-certainty that the March 8 election will proceed as scheduled, while maintaining a small tail risk for truly extraordinary events.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Colombia's 2026 parliamentary election day occur before March 9, 2026? Scheduled for March 8, 2026 – does it happen on that date?

2. **Outside view base rate**: 93% (Laplace on 19 Colombian national elections, 0 postponements). Final prediction of 97% is rooted in this base rate with strong inside-view confirmation.

3. **Consistency check**: "97 out of 100 times, Colombia's 2026 parliamentary election occurs before March 9, 2026." This aligns with the evidence – all preparations are finalized for March 8.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - March 8 election date confirmed by National Registrar, Interior Minister, and Attorney General (named officials, Feb 27-28, 2026) ✓
   - 860,000 jurors and 50,000 security personnel deployed – operationally irreversible ✓
   - ELN declared ceasefire specifically for March 7-10 to accommodate the election ✓
   - 0/19 Colombian national elections postponed since 1991 ✓
   - Dry law and border closures officially decreed for March 7-9 ✓

5. **Blind spot**: The one scenario that could make this look silly is if President Petro, using executive authority or emergency powers, somehow delays the election citing electoral fraud concerns. However, this would face immediate constitutional challenges and no credible evidence suggests this is being attempted. Probability: ~0.5-1%.

6. **Status quo**: The status quo is that the election proceeds on March 8 as planned. All evidence confirms this trajectory. A nudge toward status quo only reinforces the 97% estimate.

Probability: 97%
