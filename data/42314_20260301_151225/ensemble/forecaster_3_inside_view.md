Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution criteria (what counts):
This resolves YES if Colombia’s 2026 parliamentary (Congress) election day occurs before March 9, 2026, per Wikipedia’s “2026 Colombian parliamentary election” page; NO otherwise.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; date; fact vs opinion)
Direct / highly relevant
- Wikipedia (2026 Colombian parliamentary election page): States the election is scheduled for March 8, 2026. High relevance; medium-high reliability (crowd-edited but usually quickly updated for major election dates). Current as of access (implicit). Factual claim: scheduled date.
- El País Cali (Mar 1, 2026) “ELN announces 3-day unilateral ceasefire…”: Reports ELN ceasefire Mar 7–10 explicitly “coinciding with” the March 8 legislative elections. Reputable Colombian outlet; very recent; strong factual corroboration that authorities and major actors still expect March 8 voting.
- Semana (Feb 28, 2026) “Registraduría clarifies electoral software concerns…”: Detailed technical timeline of tests and code-freezing/hashing procedures for the March 8 elections. Semana is major national outlet; recent; factual details attributed to Registraduría (identifiable institution).
- Multiple practical “how to vote / ABC” guides (Pulzo Feb 27-28; Vanguardia Feb 27; Futbolete Feb 28; El Universal Feb 27; El Colombiano Feb 6; El Cronista Feb 14): All treat March 8, 2026 as the election day and discuss logistics/rules. These are mixed-quality (some are more tabloid/service journalism), but the unanimity across many outlets is useful corroboration. Mostly factual (hours, ley seca, border closures, ballot colors) sourced to government/Registraduría.
- Semana (Feb 25 and Feb 23, 2026): Coverage of Penagos responding to Petro’s criticisms; Attorney General/Procuraduría oversight; audits by CAPEL; again assumes March 8 election day. High relevance; recent; much of it is factual statements by named officials, alongside some political rhetoric/opinion.

Security / conflict-related corroboration
- AP / Killeen Daily Herald extraction (Feb 23, 2026) about ELN ceasefire “ahead of key congressional elections”: Extraction incomplete, but headline/date strongly align with March 8 being imminent. Moderate reliability (AP generally strong; extraction limits reduce certainty).

Irrelevant to Colombia election timing (should carry ~0 weight)
- Oregon House election rescheduling article (Feb 27, 2026): irrelevant.
- PBS Japan election article (Feb 8, 2026): irrelevant.
- Al Jazeera Iraq elections (Nov 9, 2025): irrelevant.
- Muslim Network TV ICE shooting (Feb 25, 2026): irrelevant.
- ColombiaReports 2022 ELN ceasefire article (May 16, 2022): only weakly relevant as historical context/pattern; not about 2026 scheduling.

(b) Evidence analysis with weights (relative to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence (supports YES; pushes probability up)
- Many independent, recent, Colombia-focused outlets + Registraduría-linked details all converge on March 8, 2026 as election day (multiple-source convergence; hard-to-fake because logistics are public and nationwide). Mechanism: election machinery already deployed and publicly scheduled. (Strong)
- Institutional/structural rigidity + very short runway: only 7 days to election; postponement would require extraordinary legal/political act and massive logistical reversal. (Strong)
- Concrete operational steps already taken: software tests completed; code hash-freezing procedures; deployment of security plans; ley seca and border closure orders; overseas voting window Mar 2–8. These are costly signals of “election is happening.” (Strong)

Moderate evidence (supports YES)
- ELN ceasefire announcement timed to March 8. While not determinative, it is a salient “even armed actors are planning around March 8” signal, reducing the chance that security disruption forces a national postponement. (Moderate)

Weak evidence / small adjustments
- Historical context that Colombia’s congressional elections are typically held in early/mid March; plus no recent postponement history (already captured in the outside view). (Weak-to-moderate as incremental inside-view evidence, since it mainly reaffirms the base rate.)

Key pathways to NO (what would need to happen)
- A last-minute national postponement past March 9 due to: (i) major constitutional crisis/coup; (ii) catastrophic natural disaster affecting national logistics; (iii) nationwide security collapse making voting infeasible; (iv) decisive court order suspending elections; (v) a systemic technological/logistical failure so severe authorities formally move election day.
Given present reporting, none of these pathways show meaningful leading indicators beyond routine political tension.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: March 1, 2026. Election day is March 8, 2026. Resolution cutoff: March 9, 2026. Time left: ~7 days.
- If the timeframe were halved (3–4 days to go), probability would rise slightly because fewer tail risks remain to materialize and derail the date.
- If the timeframe were doubled (~14 days), probability would fall slightly because there’s more time for shocks, legal interventions, or major security events to occur.

(d) Justification (inside view vs outside view)
Outside view base rate was extremely high (97.5%) given Colombia’s long record of holding congressional elections on the constitutionally expected March Sunday and the inertia of election logistics.

Inside-view updates: the current information is unusually dense and operational—security decrees, auditing and hashing procedures, simulations, overseas voting schedule starting March 2, and widespread public guidance all point to a “locked-in” March 8 election. That pushes me modestly upward from the already-high base rate, mainly by reducing the probability mass on “soft postponement due to administrative or political disputes.” What remains is mostly “hard shock” tail risk (major disaster/coup/court-ordered suspension), which is small but not zero.

Probability calibration:
- Status quo / current trend: election occurs March 8, 2026 → YES (before March 9).
- I adjust the outside-view 97.5% upward modestly because (i) near-term operational commitments are now publicly visible and (ii) multiple independent sources within the last 2–3 days explicitly reference March 8 and related legal/security measures.
- Remaining uncertainty (~1–2%) is dominated by low-frequency, high-impact events in the coming week.

Checklist:
1) Criteria check: YES iff election day occurs before Mar 9, 2026 (Wikipedia as primary source); election is set for Mar 8.
2) Outside view base rate used: 97.5%.
3) Consistency line: 98.7 out of 100 times, Colombia holds its parliamentary election before March 9, 2026.
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Registraduría + media uniformly describe March 8 election day with finalized logistics (Feb 27–Mar 1).
   - Government has implemented ley seca/border closure/security plan specifically for March 7–9 window.
   - Overseas voting window is already scheduled for Mar 2–8, indicating execution is imminent.
5) Blind spot: a sudden constitutional/court intervention or national emergency (disaster/security shock) forcing postponement beyond Mar 9.
6) Status quo: strong inertia toward holding the election on the already-announced date.

Probability: 98.7%
