Analysis:
1) Source analysis  
- Registraduría statements (Semana, El País, Vanguardia, Pulzo, El Colombiano, Feb 6-28 2026): official election authority, named spokes-people, dated within last three weeks; high reliability. All confirm 8 Mar 2026 polling day and describe final technical “freeze”, dry-law, security plan. Factual; negligible opinion.  
- AP / Killeen Daily Herald (23 Feb 2026) and El País-Cali cease-fire note (1 Mar 2026): independent, professional outlets; confirm ELN 3-day cease-fire to facilitate the 8 Mar vote. High reliability.  
- Historical record (Wikipedia election page, IPU data): secondary but consistent with primary Colombian law; good for long-run pattern.  
(No other crawled pieces are germane.)

2) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large weight, pro-Yes)  
• Multiple official communiqués and mainstream reports, all within 3 weeks, reiterate election date 8 Mar 2026 and describe irreversible final-week logistics.  
• Thirty-year Colombian precedent: nine consecutive congressional elections held on schedule (zero postponements).  
• Constitutional schedule plus completed ballots, printed materials, 860 000 jurors, 50 000-person security deployment: high sunk costs, hard to change inside 7 days.  

Moderate evidence (some weight, contra-Yes)  
• 208 municipalities flagged high-risk; electoral violence historically elevated. Could trigger last-minute emergency in theory.  
• Political tensions (President Petro criticisms of software) – but Registrar and Attorney-General publicly stated readiness.

Weak evidence (small weight, contra-Yes)  
• General possibility of terror attacks, natural disasters; no current alert.  
• Anecdotal doubts on software integrity.

3) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in 8 days. Halving (4 days out) would slightly increase confidence as logistics lock in; doubling (16 days) would marginally widen tail risk but still leave probability >97 %.

4) Justification / inside view shift  
Base rate (outside view): 98.4 % chance election occurs on time.  
Current news shows final simulations complete, ballots delivered nationwide, cease-fire declared, dry-law and border closures scheduled. No legal motions or administrative signals of delay. These factors strengthen – not weaken – the baseline. I adjust upward 0.4 % to 98.8 %. Residual 1.2 % covers conceivable but unlikely shocks: large-scale coordinated violence, catastrophic earthquake, or government decree postponing nationwide vote.

Probability calibration
If we re-ran this situation 100 times with identical information, about 99 would see Colombia voting on or before 8 Mar 2026; 1–2 would not. My point estimate: 98.8 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Colombia’s 2026 congressional election day fall before 9 Mar 2026?  
2. Outside view: 98.4 % on-time (zero postponements in nine cycles).  
3. Consistency line: “In 98.8 cases out of 100, the election happens by 8 Mar 2026.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Registraduría confirms 8 Mar date & code freeze; b) National security plan & dry-law issued; c) ELN cease-fire eases violence risk; d) 30-year perfect on-schedule record.  
5. Blind-spot: Massive, unforeseen security incident 5–7 Mar forces presidential state-of-siege and nationwide postponement. Would slash probability toward 60 %.  
6. Status-quo: Calendar and logistics point to on-time vote; nudging toward status-quo outcome is appropriate.

Probability: 98.8%
