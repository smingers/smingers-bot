Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Wikipedia “2026 Colombian parliamentary election” (20 Feb 2026). Factual page; says election set for Sun 8 Mar 2026. High reliability for the formal date; no persuasive opinions.  
2. Associated Press / WTOP (23 Feb 2026). Reports ELN unilateral cease-fire “for the 8 March congressional elections”. Wire-service, datelined Bogotá; reliable factual confirmation.  
3. Semana (28 Feb 2026). Registraduría answers software-integrity questions; specifies tests already finished and code “frozen” for the 8 Mar vote. Named officials; high-quality primary sourcing.  
4. Pulzo (28 Feb 2026). Interior minister announces ley-seca, border closures timed to 7-9 Mar. Reliable local outlet quoting minister; confirms preparations.  
5. El País Cali (1 Mar 2026). ELN confirms 3-day cease-fire 7-10 Mar “coinciding with legislative elections scheduled for 8 Mar”. Reputable regional daily; reinforces security picture.  
6. Vanguardia / El Colombiano series (Feb 6-29 2026). Detailed logistics: 125 k voting tables, 860 k jurors, 50 k security forces; no relocations. All cite National Registrar Hernán Penagos.  
All six are dated within last 25 days, quote identifiable institutions (Registraduría, Interior Ministry, ELN). They provide factual scheduling information; any opinion quoted comes from officials directly involved in administering elections.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Statutory rule (Art. 207) and 35-year unbroken record of holding national votes on schedule.  
• Multiple official statements in Feb 2026 affirm election will be 8 Mar.  
• Comprehensive logistics (ballots printed, software frozen, security deployed) already completed.  
Moderate evidence  
• ELN cease-fire reduces, rather than increases, last-minute security risk.  
• CAPEL & EU audits concluded without red flags; suggests no legal injunctions imminent.  
Weak evidence  
• Colombia’s general security environment is volatile; armed attacks could, in theory, trigger emergency.  
• Natural-disaster risk (earthquake, floods) always present but low probability in any given week.

Net evidence tilts further toward an on-time election.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window is 7 days (1 Mar→9 Mar).  If the window were halved to 3½ days, probability would rise ~1 pp (most show-stopping incidents would surface instantly).  If it were doubled to 14 days, probability would drop ~2-3 pp because legal postponement would still be possible ahead of 15 Mar.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment)  
Outside-view base rate = 93 %.  
Adjust upward for:  
+ Strong institutional rigidity & completed logistics (+2 pp).  
+ Confirmed nationwide preparations, no signs of court or congressional action to delay (+1 pp).  
+ Rebel cease-fire reduces security tail risk (+0.5 pp).  
Adjust downward for:  
– Residual risk of catastrophic shock (major terror attack, 7+ earthquake, nationwide cyber failure) (-0.5 pp).  

Inside-view estimate ≈ 96 %.

Probability calibration
If status quo continues (most likely), election happens 8 Mar ⇒ Yes.  
A ±10 pp swing would require either: i) credible reports government planning postponement (–10 pp), or ii) formal early voting date suddenly recognised (<8 Mar) (+? pp – but “held” already requires main election day). Neither is currently present, so 96 % feels well-calibrated.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will Colombia’s 2026 congressional election day occur before 9 Mar 2026?”  
2. Base rate used: 93 %.  
3. Consistency line: “96 out of 100 times, Colombia will hold the 2026 parliamentary election on or before 8 Mar 2026.”  
4. Key evidence (20 words each):  
   – 35-year record: 0/19 national elections postponed.  
   – Official calendar & statements: Registraduría, Interior Ministry reiterate 8 Mar date.  
   – Logistics finished: ballots, software, security forces in place one week out.  
   – ELN cease-fire lowers immediate violence threat.  
5. Blind-spot: Massive earthquake in Bogotá on 6-Mar forcing nationwide emergency and court-sanctioned delay. Could cut probability to ≈70 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome is on-time election; short timeframe and completed preparations argue for nudging toward status-quo.

Probability: 96%
