Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. Wikipedia – “2026 Colombian parliamentary election” (updated 20 Feb 2026)  
   • Factual: states the legally-scheduled date as 8 Mar 2026.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Quality: Good for “what date is scheduled?”; constantly revised but transparent edit log.  

2. WTOP / Associated Press, 23 Feb 2026 (“ELN declares cease-fire…”)  
   • Factual: reiterates the 8 Mar date; describes security risks and a rebel cease-fire.  
   • Opinion: quotes from rebels and election watchdog – put aside for outside view.  
   • Quality: International wire service with on-the-ground quotes; reliable for basic facts.  

3. Agent report – chronology of every Colombian national election 1990-2022  
   • Factual: shows 10 congressional cycles (1990-2022) all held on the constitutionally-mandated second Sunday of March; zero nationwide postponements.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Quality: High – cites Colombian legal articles, Registraduría calendars and IPU data; cross-checked against public records.  

4–12. Remaining articles (electoral-systems primer, 2018 presidential coverage, Somalia, US-Venezuela etc.)  
   • Factual content unrelated to the timing of Colombia’s 2026 vote.  
   • Quality: not pertinent for this forecast.  

(b) Reference class analysis  

Candidate classes  
R1. All Colombian congressional elections since the 1991 Constitution (10 cases) – perfect institutional match.  
R2. All national-level elections in Colombia (congressional + presidential) since 1991 (19 cases) – doubles the sample, same legal rigidity.  
R3. Latin-American parliamentary elections during 1990-2025 scheduled for a specific day (≈200 cases) – larger N but mixed statutory flexibility.  

Suitability: R1 is closest to the event structure (same office, same constitutional article, same four-year cadence, same administering body). R2 adds helpful data without diluting comparability, so I adopt R2 as the primary reference class and use R1 as a sensitivity check.

(c) Timeframe analysis  

Today: 1 Mar 2026. Election due: 8 Mar 2026 → 7 days out.  
In the reference class, no Colombian election has been postponed within the final month before the vote; in fact none has been postponed at all in 35 years.  
Exogenous shocks capable of forcing a one-week postponement would have to materialise almost immediately and overcome high legal/institutional barriers (Congress would have to amend the statutory calendar or the President would have to decree an emergency and survive Constitutional-Court scrutiny).

(d) Justification (outside-view)  

Base-rate: 0/19 national elections postponed ⇒ empirical failure rate 0%.  Applying Laplace’s rule of succession yields:  
P(on-time) = (0 failures + 1) / (19 + 2) = 1 / 21 ≈ 4.8 % chance of postponement → 95.2 % chance the election occurs as scheduled or earlier.  

Adjustment factors (still outside view, i.e. structural rather than event-specific):  
• Legal stickiness: The second-Sunday-of-March rule is entrenched in Art. 207; changing it on one week’s notice is unprecedented (+).  
• Conflict history: Even at the 2002 violence peak and during the 2022 COVID wave, elections proceeded on time (+).  
• Natural-disaster precedent: Colombia experiences earthquakes, floods, and pandemics yet has never shifted a national election (+).  
• Small-N caveat: 19 is not huge; a single upset would make the failure rate ≈5%. (–)  

Net effect: The raw Laplace figure (95%) looks slightly low given the powerful structural incentives, but prudence tells us the true risk is not zero. I trim 1–2 pp off the “perfect-record” optimism to respect tail hazards (e.g., extraordinary Constitutional Court injunction, sudden national security crisis).

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: 95.2 % from Laplace on 19-case record.  
• Expert/market tether: None yet available; keep the statistical anchor.  
• Upset rate: within well-established democracies that tie election dates to law (e.g., U.S., Chile, Costa Rica) the odds of a postponement inside one week are ≈1–3 % over three decades. Combining with the Colombian record supports a low-single-digit failure risk.  
• Final calibrated outside-view probability that the election is held on or before 8 Mar 2026 (and thus before 9 Mar): 93 %.

Outside View Prediction:
93.0 %
