**Analyzing election probabilities**

I need to focus on the outside view, using historical frequencies while also mentioning recent events minimally. I'll summarize each relevant source concisely, especially around national parliamentary elections in Colombia since 1991, comparing scheduled versus held elections. Since we're only 7-8 days out from the election and cancellations are rare, I’ll establish a numerical probability. Historically, there have been 10 cycles since 1990 with no postponements, so using Laplace's rule, I’m estimating about a 91.7% chance it happens on schedule.**Crafting probability estimates**

I’m considering broadening the reference class to include global elections, where there might be a 2% postponement rate. Given that, I could adjust my probability estimate to around 92%. It’s crucial to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant sources, summarizing the relevant ones effectively for clarity. I need to provide a careful evaluation of the gathered information to support this probability. Let’s work on crafting a clear and concise answer that reflects all these components!
