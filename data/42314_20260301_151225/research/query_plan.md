Analysis:
The Wikipedia excerpt confirms the election is scheduled for 8 March 2026, but forecasters still need to gauge (a) how often Colombian or comparable elections slip, (b) the legal/constitutional rigidity of the date, and (c) any breaking indications—security, logistical, political, or natural-disaster-related—that might force a last-minute delay.  The plan therefore:

1. Build a historical base rate of Colombian and peer-country election postponements.
2. Locate the legal provisions that lock the date (or allow suspension) so forecasters know the hurdle for any change.
3. Capture current-week news from Colombian authorities, election agencies, and security actors (e.g., ELN, CNE, Registraduría Nacional) about election readiness or threats.
4. Run a contrarian check for postponement rumours or emergency declarations.
5. Use one Agent query to pull a compact history of Colombian national elections vs. schedule—quickly surfacing any prior deviations.
