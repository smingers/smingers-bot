According to a statement titled 'Hechos de Paz' (Peaceful Acts) issued by the ELN's National Directorate, the group has directed all its structures to refrain from offensive military operations against the State's Armed Forces during this period. The ELN explicitly stated in the document that it is not their policy to 'threaten or attack candidates' and aims to send a 'clear message of respect for the free right to vote and non-interference in the current electoral process'. This announcement occurs amidst high tension in various regions of Colombia where the group has a historical armed presence. On March 8, Colombian citizens will vote to elect new members of the Congress of the Republic and participate in internal consultations to define presidential candidates for 2026. According to the National Civil Registry Office (Registradur\u00eda Nacional del Estado Civil), millions of citizens are registered to vote both nationally and abroad. To ensure the smooth conduct of the election, the National Government and the Public Force have deployed a reinforced security presence, particularly in rural areas and municipalities prioritized for security risks. Additionally, the 'dry law' (ley seca) will be in effect, restricting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages before and after the vote to prevent public order disturbances. While the ELN has previously announced temporary ceasefires during electoral processes or state dialogues, the actual compliance with this measure is critical for citizens in high-risk zones to exercise their voting rights without pressure or violence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 01:30 PM\nSource:[El Pa\u00eds Cali](https://www.elpais.com.co/colombia/eln-anuncia-cese-unilateral-del-fuego-durante-tres-dias-por-elecciones-del-8-de-marzo-en-colombia-0137.html)\n\n**Colombia's National Registry Clarifies Electoral Software Concerns for March 8 Elections**\nThe National Registry Office (Registradur\u00eda Nacional) of Colombia responded to Interior Minister Armando Benedetti regarding questions raised about the software and procedures for the upcoming elections scheduled for March 8, 2026. According to the article, these elections, which will determine the results of consultations and the new Congress, are viewed as a critical test ahead of the presidential elections in May 2026. The Registradur\u00eda clarified that the source code for the tally, pre-count, jury lottery, consolidation, and dissemination systems is available for independent review by political party auditors in dedicated audit rooms. Specific testing dates were confirmed: pre-count tests occurred on February 7 and 21, 2026; tally tests on February 23 and 24, 2026; and E14 digitalization tests on February 26 and 28, 2026, with party auditors invited to participate. To ensure software integrity, the Registradur\u00eda explained that after the source code is exposed, it is 'frozen' and each executable is registered and stored. A 'hash' is generated during this process and is re-generated on election day to verify it matches the original frozen hash. The entity stated that while auditors are not required to sign a confidentiality agreement, the use of cell phones and other devices is prohibited. Regarding the potential for algorithmic counting errors, the Registradur\u00eda stated that if such flaws are evident, the situation will be evaluated and analyzed, and necessary measures will be taken.

Citizens can verify their assigned polling place and voting table in seconds via the official portal of the Registradur\u00eda Nacional del Estado Civil by entering their c\u00e9dula de ciudadan\u00eda (citizenship ID) number. The system displays essential details including the polling place name, full address, assigned table number, municipality, and department, which is crucial for planning travel in large cities. Voting hours are set from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., with a note that high attendance may occur in some sectors. To vote, citizens must present an original c\u00e9dula de ciudadan\u00eda, receive the corresponding ballot card (tarjet\u00f3n), mark a clear 'X' within the designated box for their preferred party or candidate without making additional marks or writing messages, and deposit the ballot in the indicated urn. Errors require requesting a new card before voting. The elected Congress members will be responsible for debating laws, processing constitutional reforms, summoning ministers, and electing high officials such as the Attorney General and high court magistrates; the article clarifies that senators do not directly execute public resources or contract works individually. Additionally, the Congress includes special seats (curules especiales) to ensure representation for recognized communities, including indigenous peoples and Black, Afro-Colombian, Raizal, and Palenquera communities. Voters receive an electoral certificate after voting, which can provide benefits such as discounts on academic procedures and advantages in state processes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[futbolete.com](https://futbolete.com/taalk/elecciones-colombia-8-de-marzo-consultar-lugar-votacion/987124/)\n\n**Colombia Implements Dry Law and Border Closures Ahead of March 8 Elections**\nThe Colombian National Government has announced security and electoral integrity measures for the March 8, 2026, election day, which includes both internal party consultations and the election of members of the Congress of the Republic. A key measure is the imposition of a nationwide 'dry law' (ley seca), prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages from 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, March 7, 2026, to 6:00 a.m. on Monday, March 9, 2026, as stated by Interior Minister Armando Benedetti. This restriction aims to ensure public tranquility and reduce alcohol-related incidents during the electoral period. Additionally, border closures are planned to begin on Friday, March 7, 2026, with two proposed times under discussion: noon or 6:00 p.m., and will remain in effect until 6:00 a.m. on March 9, 2026. The decision balances public order concerns with economic impacts on border traders. Political gatherings are restricted to closed spaces from Monday, March 2, 2026, to Monday, March 9, 2026. The Ministry of the Interior will establish coordination links in all 32 departments and Bogot\u00e1 starting Thursday, March 5, 2026. A Unified Command Post (PMU) will be activated in Bogot\u00e1 on March 4, 2026, to oversee overseas electoral processes in coordination with the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Registradur\u00eda, and high-ranking military and civilian officials.

The Registradur\u00eda Nacional has designed color-coded ballots to prevent confusion: blue for the National Circumscription Senate, pink for the Indigenous Special Circumscription Senate, brown for the Territorial Circumscription Chamber (used by most voters in Santander), green for Indigenous Communities, and gray for Afrodescendant Communities. Voters must select only one Senate ballot and one Chamber ballot; marking more than one ballot or multiple lists on a single ballot nullifies the vote. For preferential voting, voters may mark the party logo and the candidate\u2019s number; for non-preferential voting, only the party logo needs to be marked. In the presidential precandidate consultation, voters must mark only one candidate across three distinct coalitions; marking more than one invalidates the vote. The use of mobile phones is strictly prohibited inside voting booths.

Voting will take place from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at 87 municipal polling stations across the department. Voters will receive up to three ballots: one for the Senate (blue for National Circumscription or pink for Indigenous Communities), one for the Chamber of Representatives (brown for Territorial Circumscription, applicable to most Santandereanos), and one for the presidential primary. Only one ballot per body may be cast. The use of electronic devices, including mobile phones, is prohibited from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., except for accredited election monitors after 4:00 p.m. who may report irregularities. The only valid voting document is the Colombian National Identity Card (C\u00e9dula de Ciudadan\u00eda), including its digital version on mobile devices. Foreign residents with a valid resident alien ID and five continuous years of residency in Colombia may vote only in the presidential primary, not in congressional elections. Voters must check their polling place via the Registradur\u00eda Nacional website (www.registraduria.gov.co) using their ID number. Latecomers who arrive after 4:00 p.m. cannot vote, even if they are in line. Voters with physical disabilities may be accompanied into the voting booth.

Requirements and How It Works**\nThe Registradur\u00eda Nacional confirmed that both the traditional yellow physical ID card and the digital ID card are valid for voting in Colombia's legislative elections and presidential consultation on March 8, 2026. The digital ID, available since 2022, is legally equivalent to the physical version and can be used on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. Voters must present either the physical or digital ID at any polling station; other forms of identification, including passports, military service books, driver\u2019s licenses, or loss reports, are not accepted. To vote with the digital ID, the voter must display the document on their device, where it will be verified using facial recognition or a security PIN. The system checks the document\u2019s authenticity and the voter\u2019s identity through live facial verification and a moving hologram with the Registradur\u00eda\u2019s logo. The 'Certify' button activates a tactile, dynamic hologram to prevent forgery. According to the Registradur\u00eda, the digital ID reduces the risk of identity fraud. The digital ID is valid for all national elections, including legislative and presidential ones.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 27, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[www.vanguardia.com](https://www.vanguardia.com/politica/elecciones/2026/02/27/se-puede-votar-con-cedula-digital-en-las-elecciones-del-8-de-marzo-requisitos-y-como-funciona/)\n\n**CNE Launches Special Campaign to Register Electoral Witnesses Ahead of 2026 Elections**\nThe Colombian National Electoral Council (CNE) conducted a special outreach event from February 28 to March 1, 2026, to support the registration of electoral witnesses for the 2026 elections, which began with interparty consultations on March 8.

The initiative aimed to facilitate the registration process and strengthen electoral guarantees for all political actors. The CNE also launched the pioneering 'Platform for Postulation and Accreditation of Electoral Actors,' a digital tool enabling electoral witnesses, observers, and system auditors\u2014both in Colombia and abroad\u2014to obtain advanced digital credentials for access to assigned voting stations. According to the CNE, 971 electoral witnesses and 26 system auditors have already been postulated via the platform. Additionally, as of February 25, 2026, 3,752 postulations were received from Colombian citizens abroad for the electoral process running from March 2 to March 8, 2026. These witnesses will monitor 3,332 voting tables across 254 polling stations in 67 countries, contributing to transparency and reducing fraud risks. Mariby Barros Ruiz, a campaign representative, praised the platform as 'very complete and easy to understand,' noting it represents progress in Colombia\u2019s electoral system by enhancing efficiency and security.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 27, 2026 10:11 PM\nSource:[El Pa\u00eds Cali](https://www.elpais.com.co/elecciones/cne-abre-jornada-especial-inscribase-como-testigo-electoral-en-valle-del-cauca-2731.html)\n\n**Ley Seca for Colombia\u2019s March 8 Elections: Armando Benedetti Announces Schedules and Security Measures**\nColombia will hold legislative elections on March 8, 2026, and the government has decreed a 'dry law' (Ley Seca) from 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, March 7, to 6:00 a.m. on Monday, March 9. Interior Minister Armando Benedetti announced the measure during a press conference, noting that the border closure time is under review\u2014proposed at 12:00 p.m. but currently under evaluation due to concerns about impacts on cross-border commerce if maintained at 7:00 p.m. as in previous years. Political gatherings are restricted to closed venues from Monday, March 2, to Monday, March 9, to preserve public order. The Ministry of Interior has designated liaison officers in all 32 departments, who will begin their duties on Thursday, March 5, to coordinate with local authorities and ensure timely response to electoral issues.

Penagos confirmed that all polling stations and voting booths are secured, thanks to the relocation of some sites due to weather conditions and the presence of the Public Forces. In response to Petro\u2019s concerns about the handling of form E-14, Penagos clarified that one E-14 form will be issued per political party, coalition, or organization\u2014such as 16 forms for each Senate contender. On February 25, 2026, the Registradur\u00eda released the source code, enabling technical personnel from all political sectors to review the software used for pre-counting, scrutiny, and data consolidation. The entity invited political parties and election monitors to witness the hashing code freeze to ensure integrity before and after the elections. Penagos emphasized that the pre-counting process generates preliminary data via 28 telephone service centers and is separate from the official scrutiny, which is based on E-14 actas. The software for this phase is provided by Indra, the same firm used in the 2022 presidential and congressional elections, and is available for audit by the National Electoral Council (CNE). Ballot marking will be facilitated by pens tested in the presence of national and international monitors; voters may also bring their own markers.

He emphasized that the Office of the Attorney General, through two delegated procuratorates\u2014one technical and one legal\u2014has maintained continuous oversight since the electoral calendar began. The Registradur\u00eda has invited the Office to review all technological components, including source code, algorithms, and electronic data transmission, ahead of the February 25, 2026, presentation. The strategy 'Paz Electoral' has received support from major institutions including the Catholic Church, notaries, the Association of Capital Cities (Asocapitales), Red PRO, and chambers of commerce. The National Registradur\u00eda confirmed that international audits are being conducted by CAPEL (Institute for Electoral and Democratic Advancement), a respected regional body with extensive experience in Latin American electoral processes. CAPEL is auditing software for pre-counting, counting, consolidation, and national dissemination of results. The Registradur\u00eda\u2019s director, Hern\u00e1n Penagos, affirmed that CAPEL\u2019s involvement aims to elevate the security and quality of Colombia\u2019s electoral systems, with technical reports to be made publicly available. President Gustavo Petro has called for full source code access for party-appointed experts to conduct a comprehensive technological audit, arguing that private companies like Thomas Greg & Sons may be influencing the process. The upcoming elections include legislative elections on March 8, 2026, internal party consultations, and presidential elections on May 31, 2026.

The National Registry (Registradur\u00eda Nacional del Estado Civil), led by Registrar Hern\u00e1n Penagos, announced a comprehensive electoral reform package aimed at enhancing transparency, integrity, and participation. Key innovations include expanding biometric verification\u2014using facial or fingerprint recognition\u2014to between 60,000 and 65,000 voting stations, up from around 25,000 in previous elections, to prevent identity fraud. All electoral actas (E-14 forms) will be fully digitized: over 700,000 for the legislative elections and 360,000 for the presidential vote, enabling public verification of results at the individual ballot level. The number of voting stations will increase from 112,000 to 127,000 for the March 8 vote and from 102,000 to nearly 125,000 for the May 31 vote to reduce wait times. Additional measures include mobile registration campaigns in urban areas and, for the first time, virtual registration for Colombian citizens abroad, who will vote between March 2 and 8 in consulates. The registration process for legislative candidates opened on November 8, 2025, and closed on December 8, 2025, while presidential candidate registration began on January 31, 2026, and ends on March 13, 2026. The event was attended by top national institutions, including the Attorney General, the Ombudsman, the Comptroller, and the National Electoral Council. The Registradur\u00eda will manage logistics, while the National Electoral Council oversees compliance, campaign financing, and political party conduct. Penagos emphasized the importance of combating voter abstention, stating that 'we must work with total determination to defeat electoral abstention.' The composition of the new Congress will be critical in shaping the legislative agenda, including structural reforms proposed by the incoming president. Citizens are urged to verify their polling location, check jury status, and bring their original ID to vote.

This election is pivotal as it determines the political balance that will shape national decision-making for years to come. On the same day, three political coalitions will hold internal consultations\u2014acting as primary elections\u2014to select unified presidential candidates, with the first round of the presidential election scheduled for May 31, 2026, and a potential second round on June 21, 2026, if no candidate secures an absolute majority. Voters will receive separate ballots for the Congress and the presidential primaries. The Congress plays a central role in Colombia\u2019s democratic system by debating and enacting laws on taxation, national budget, health, education, security, social programs, and cultural heritage. Political experts emphasize that a president needs legislative support to govern effectively, as lack of congressional backing complicates policy implementation. The National Registry of Civil Status (Registradur\u00eda Nacional del Estado Civil) launched a digital georeferenced tool to help voters locate polling stations both domestically and abroad, enhancing transparency and trust in the electoral process. The registration authority, Hern\u00e1n Penagos, confirmed that the initiative aims to strengthen transparency. Additional electoral reforms include expanding polling stations, implementing facial and fingerprint biometrics to prevent voter impersonation, and conducting technological audits to ensure electoral integrity. The March 8, 2026, vote is not merely about electing legislators\u2014it defines the body responsible for shaping laws, overseeing the executive, and determining the nation\u2019s political direction for the next several years.

The ballot includes three presidential consultations: 'Consulta de las Soluciones: Salud, Seguridad y Educaci\u00f3n,' 'La Gran Consulta por Colombia,' and 'Frente por la Vida.' The Registradur\u00eda emphasized that all three consultations will appear on a single ballot to preserve the secrecy of the vote, warning that voting for more than one consultation will invalidate the ballot. Registrador Hern\u00e1n Penagos stated that issuing separate ballots per political organization or coalition would violate voting secrecy, as it could expose a voter\u2019s political preference. The document marks a key step toward the 2026 elections, which will determine Colombia\u2019s political future, as President Gustavo Petro\u2019s constitutional term ends on August 7, 2026.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 12:26 AM\nSource:[Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo](https://www.semana.com/politica/articulo/se-revelo-el-tarjeton-electoral-de-las-consultas-presidenciales-para-el-proximo-8-de-marzo-esta-es-la-imagen/202626/)\n\n**Registradur\u00eda Conducts Simulations Ahead of March 8, 2026 Elections**\nThe Registradur\u00eda Nacional de Colombia has initiated a series of simulations from February 7 to February 26, 2026, in preparation for the March 8, 2026 congressional elections.

Eligible voters registered at consulates may vote in inter-party consultations, Senate elections, the international constituency election for the Chamber of Representatives, and the first round of the presidential election. Voting for legislative elections and inter-party consultations will take place from March 2 to March 8, while presidential voting abroad will occur from May 25 to May 31. The Registradur\u00eda confirmed that Colombian residents abroad can vote for the Senate, and for one representative in the Chamber of Representatives from the international constituency. They may also participate in inter-party consultations, such as the Gran Consulta por Colombia and the Pacto Amplio, used to select presidential candidates. A facial biometrics tool has been implemented to enable remote identity verification for electoral services, including data updates and digital platform validation. According to official data, 1,096,368 Colombians living abroad are registered in the electoral census. To vote, citizens must have their ID registered at a consulate, which grants them national electoral eligibility. In 2022, the Registradur\u00eda operated 250 voting stations across 67 countries, with 1,343 polling places established at consulates and diplomatic missions\u2014this framework will serve as the foundation for 2026. Although turnout abroad has historically been lower than the number of registered voters, their votes remain highly significant, especially in inter-party consultations, Senate elections, and a potential presidential race decided by narrow margins. With extended voting days, consular presence, and over one million eligible voters, the overseas vote is once again a key component of Colombia\u2019s 2026 electoral process.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 06:18 PM\nSource:[Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo](https://www.semana.com/mejor-colombia/articulo/elecciones-en-colombia-2026-cuando-y-como-votar-desde-el-exterior/202628/)\n\n**Colombia\u2019s 2026 Elections: Why March 8 and What to Expect**\nColombia will hold legislative elections on Sunday, March 8, 2026, as confirmed by the National Registry of Civil Status (Registradur\u00eda Nacional del Estado Civil). The presidential election will take place on May 31, 2026, with the legislative vote occurring nearly three months earlier, consistent with Colombia\u2019s electoral system. According to National Registrar Hern\u00e1n Penagos, the Registradur\u00eda guarantees transparent and integral elections. The registration period for voters to change their voting location for the legislative election ended on January 8, 2026, and is no longer available. For the presidential election, voter location changes can still be registered until March 31, 2026\u2014two months before the vote. Candidate registrations for Congress occurred between November 8 and December 8, 2025, while presidential candidacies will be registered from January 31 to March 13, 2026. The Registradur\u00eda announced several measures to strengthen electoral transparency, including expanding biometric identification (facial and fingerprint) from 25,000 to 60,000\u201365,000 voting stations to prevent identity fraud. All E-14 ballot act forms\u2014over 700,000 for Congress and 360,000 for the presidency\u2014will be fully digitized and made publicly accessible. Additionally, electoral audits will be strengthened, and the number of voting stations will increase: from 112,000 to 127,000 for Congress and from 102,000 to approximately 125,000 for the presidency.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:23 PM\nSource:[El Pa\u00eds Cali](https://www.elpais.com.co/elecciones/elecciones-8-de-marzo-del-2026-por-que-se-vota-ese-dia-revise-el-calendario-electoral-2823.html)\n\n**Countdown to the 2026 Elections: Here's How the Logistics Are Being Managed**\nWith fewer than 200 days remaining until the 2026 Colombian presidential elections, the electoral process is advancing rapidly.

The Registradur\u00eda, led by Hern\u00e1n Penagos, is strengthening its mechanisms and tools to ensure transparency and a smooth electoral calendar, aiming to prevent disruptions.

How to Secure Your Vote in Colombia\u2019s 2026 Elections**\nThe registration of the Colombian national ID (c\u00e9dula) is the essential first step for citizens wishing to participate in the 2026 congressional and presidential elections in Colombia. Both the National Registry of Civil Status (Registradur\u00eda) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Canciller\u00eda) have established a nationwide and international infrastructure to allow citizens to register or update their voting location. This includes hundreds of physical registration points and special days at high-traffic locations such as shopping centers and public transport hubs, operating from Monday to Saturday until March 31, 2026. In Bogot\u00e1, coordination with the TransMilenio transport system enhances access during key days. The process is free and requires either a physical c\u00e9dula with holograms or a digital version, ensuring secure and modern electoral identification. Registration is required only for those who have changed residence, returned permanently to Colombia, or obtained their c\u00e9dula before 1988 without joining the electoral census. Citizens can verify their current voting location online via the official Registradur\u00eda website. The Consular Registration for voting abroad is separate from other consular records and must be completed at embassies or consulates up to two months before each election. Once completed, re-registration is not needed. The registration period is final and no changes are allowed after the elections, ensuring electoral order, efficiency, and transparency, in line with Constitutional and legal frameworks such as Resolution 2580 of March 5, 2025. Key dates in the 2026 electoral calendar include the deadline for citizen registration (March 31, 2026), campaign periods, the start of overseas voting on May 25, the presidential election on May 31, and the subsequent scrutiny phase. Authorities stress that timely registration ensures voting at a nearby location and strengthens the legitimacy of democratic outcomes. Failure to register after moving may result in being assigned to a previous voting location, potentially requiring long-distance travel or even disqualification on election day. The Registradur\u00eda and Canciller\u00eda emphasize the importance of informed civic participation and timely updates to prevent logistical issues and ensure effective exercise of the right to vote.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 28, 2025 12:18 AM\nSource:[PULZO](https://www.pulzo.com/nacion/inscripcion-de-cedula-para-elecciones-2026-en-colombia-requisitos-fechas-y-puntos-de-registro-PP4970049A)\n\n**Registradur\u00eda\u2019s Digital Strategy Aims to Boost Overseas Colombian Voter Influence in 2026 Elections**\nThe Registradur\u00eda Nacional de Colombia aims to increase the political influence of Colombian citizens abroad in the 2026 elections by simplifying the voting registration process. Historically, overseas voting has had low participation: in the 2022 elections, only 138,000 voted for the Senate and 306,000 for the presidency, despite 1,096,368 eligible voters abroad. The Registradur\u00eda estimates that approximately 4.7 million Colombians live abroad\u2014nearly double the population of Medell\u00edn. To overcome barriers like the need to visit consulates in person, the Registradur\u00eda launched a digital platform allowing citizens abroad to update their voting location in 7\u20138 minutes. The process involves scanning a QR code, entering personal data, and completing facial biometric authentication via smartphone. Data is verified by the Registradur\u00eda\u2019s Cybersecurity Center to prevent fraud. Results are sent via email. The system is only accessible from outside Colombia. As of the article\u2019s publication, 56,000 users had successfully changed their voting location. The deadline to vote in both congressional and presidential elections is January 8, 2026; those applying between January 8 and March 31, 2026, can only vote in the presidential election. According to the Registradur\u00eda, this initiative seeks to break the historical pattern of low overseas voter turnout.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 05:39 PM\nSource:[Las2orillas](https://www.las2orillas.co/la-estrategia-con-la-que-la-registraduria-quiere-que-el-voto-en-el-exterior-incline-la-balanza-de-las-elecciones-en-2026/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on comprehensive reporting from late February 2026, Colombia's National Registry of Civil Status (Registradur\u00eda Nacional del Estado Civil) has finalized extensive logistical preparations for the national legislative elections scheduled for **Sunday, March 8, 2026** [3][10][17]. Here is a detailed breakdown of the election logistics:\n\n## Electoral Census and Infrastructure\n\nThe Registradur\u00eda has established a record electoral census of **41,287,084 eligible voters**, comprising 21,236,349 women and 20,050,735 men [14]. This includes:\n- **40,036,238 domestic voters** assigned to **125,259 voting tables** across **13,493 polling stations** (6,011 urban and 7,482 rural locations) [12][14]\n- **1,250,846 voters abroad** (683,287 women and 567,559 men) voting at **253 polling stations** in **67 countries** from March 2-8 [14]\n- **1,438,986 citizens** in conflict-affected areas (19 departments, 168 municipalities) voting through **5,042 polling stations** in 16 Special Transitory Peace Circumscriptions (Citrep) [14]\n\nThe logistical operation involves **860,000 election jurors** and **9,300 judges** who will conduct final scrutiny and result declarations [11][13].\n\n## Security and Risk Management\n\nThe government has implemented \"Plan Democracia\" with substantial security deployment:\n- **50,000 personnel** from the military, police, and navy, plus nearly **500 armored vehicles** [13]\n- **208 municipalities** (13% of the country) identified as high-risk based on 39 security variables, requiring prioritized protection [13][19]\n- Seven prioritized municipalities in Antioquia (Ituango, Brice\u00f1o, San Andr\u00e9s de Cuerquia, Toledo, Andes, Betulia, Buritic\u00e1) receiving full military presence with drones and intelligence support [4]\n- Financial rewards up to **50 million pesos** for reporting electoral crimes [13]\n- Security details assigned to over **370 congressional candidates** and **64 presidential candidates** [13]\n\nThe Registradur\u00eda confirmed **no polling station relocations** are planned due to public order concerns, maintaining all 13,493 originally designated locations [13][15].\n\n## Technology and Transparency Systems\n\nThe Registradur\u00eda has implemented multi-layered technological safeguards:\n- **Source code auditing**: The complete source code for vote counting, pre-counting, jury selection, and dissemination systems has been made available to political party auditors, international observers (European Union, OAS, Carter Center), and oversight bodies in dedicated audit rooms [1][2][9][18]\n- **Software \"freezing\"**: A cryptographic hash code system ensures the audited software version matches the election day version, with code freezing scheduled for the eve of the election [9][11]\n- **E-14 digitization**: Double data entry processes and automated validation protocols (DIVIPOLE confirmation, transmission codes) minimize errors in result transmission from polling stations [1][2]\n- **Biometric verification**: Facial and fingerprint recognition systems deployed to prevent identity fraud [7][11]\n- **Digital ID acceptance**: Voters may use either traditional physical c\u00e9dulas or digital IDs verified through facial recognition and dynamic holograms [7]\n\nThe CAPEL international institute is conducting parallel audits of pre-counting and consolidation systems to ensure international standards [18].\n\n## Voting Day Logistics\n\n**Operating Hours**: Polls open 8:00 a.m. and close 4:00 p.m. sharp (late arrivals cannot vote even if in line) [3][6].\n\n**Voter Verification**: Citizens must verify their assigned polling station via www.registraduria.gov.co using their c\u00e9dula number [3][6][10]. Voting locations include strategic sites such as shopping centers, terminals, and municipal buildings\u2014Medell\u00edn alone has 18 designated registration and verification centers including El Tesoro, Unicentro, and San Diego malls [12].\n\n**Ballot System**: Color-coded ballots prevent confusion:\n- Blue: National Circumscription Senate\n- Pink: Indigenous Special Circumscription Senate  \n- Brown: Territorial Circumscription Chamber of Representatives\n- Green: Indigenous Communities (Chamber)\n- Gray: Afrodescendant Communities (Chamber) [5][6]\n\nVoters receive up to three ballots (Senate, Chamber, and presidential primary consultation), but marking more than one option per race invalidates the vote [5][6].\n\n**Restrictions**: Mobile phones are prohibited inside voting booths from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. [5][6]. A \"dry law\" (Ley Seca) prohibits alcohol sales from 6:00 p.m. March 7 through 6:00 a.m. March 9 [8].\n\n## Special Administrative Measures\n\nThe Registradur\u00eda has made specific location adjustments to improve accessibility. In Cartagena, for example, the Corporaci\u00f3n Minuto de Dios voting point was deactivated and its 865,352 registered voters redirected to the Instituci\u00f3n Educativa San Lucas, while 12 new voting centers were activated citywide to reduce abstention [16].\n\nFor citizens abroad, registration remains open until March 31, 2026, for the presidential elections (though the deadline passed January 8 for legislative elections) [12]. Overseas voting begins May 25, 2026, for the presidential first round [17].\n\n## Institutional Coordination and Recent Developments\n\nFollowing questions from Interior Minister Armando Benedetti regarding electoral integrity, the Registradur\u00eda issued comprehensive responses on February 28, 2026, confirming that party auditors receive flat files with table-by-table vote data after each bulletin, and that the E-14 physical forms maintain full legal validity as \"the physical proof of what the jury said\" [1][2][8][15].\n\nThe \"Colombia se Viste de Paz Electoral\" campaign was launched February 26, 2026, by the Procuradur\u00eda, Registradur\u00eda, and Contralor\u00eda to combat disinformation and ensure respect for results [11].\n</Asknews_articles>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.muslimnetwork.tv/ice-agents-shot-and-killed-a-us-citizen-in-texas-dhs-did-not-initially-report-it/\">\n## Summary\n\n**Note:** This article is entirely unrelated to the forecasting question about Colombia's 2026 parliamentary election.
