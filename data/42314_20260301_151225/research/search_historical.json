The content is a general academic/policy discussion about the challenges and legitimacy of holding elections during wartime and conflict, with historical examples. Its relevance to the specific forecasting question is limited.\n\n### Key Points from the Article:\n\n**Historical Precedents of Election Postponements:**\n- The **UK and France** postponed elections during WWII, resuming only after conflict ended (1945).\n- **Israel** has repeatedly postponed elections during active hostilities (1948, 1973, and local elections in 2023\u20132024).\n- **Afghanistan (2004/2009) and Iraq (2005)** held elections amid conflict, but with severely compromised credibility due to violence and low turnout.\n\n**Colombia-Specific Reference:**\n- The article references the **2016 Colombian Peace Agreement Plebiscite**, noting it was narrowly rejected (50.2% against), highlighting risks of holding votes on complex issues during post-conflict settings and the importance of timing and public trust.\n\n**When Postponement is Considered Legitimate:**\n- International democratic standards recognize elections can be postponed during emergencies threatening human life, including war, pandemics, or large-scale disasters.\n- Over **80 countries postponed elections** during COVID-19.\n\n**No direct information** about the scheduling or status of the 2026 Colombian parliamentary election is contained in this article.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://abcnews.com/International/deep-polarization-colombia-leads-runoff-presidential-elections/story?id=55503757\">\n## Summary\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be about the **2018 Colombian presidential election**, not the 2026 parliamentary election.

On every occasion the congressional election has been held on the constitutionally prescribed second Sunday of March; the presidential first round has always taken place on the prescribed last Sunday of May.  \n2. The only out-of-cycle national vote (Congress, 27 Oct 1991) resulted from the adoption of a new constitution and was not a postponement.  \n3. Even under extraordinary conditions\u2014high-intensity internal conflict (2002) or the COVID-19 pandemic (2022)\u2014no nationwide postponement occurred; disruptions, when they happened, were strictly local and did not affect the national calendar.  \n4. The Registradur\u00eda\u2019s published electoral calendar for the next cycle (Res. xxxx/2025, reported by Semana and other outlets) again fixes the 2026 congressional election for 8 March 2026, perfectly consistent with the unbroken 36-year pattern stated above.\n\nImplications for the forecasting question (\u201cWill Colombia hold its 2026 parliamentary election before 9 March 2026?\u201d)  \n\u2022 Since 1990 Colombia has never missed the constitutional second-Sunday-of-March deadline.  \n\u2022 The scheduled date in 2026 (second Sunday = 8 March 2026) is before the cut-off of 9 March 2026.  \n\u2022 Historical precedent, legal rigidity, and the Registradur\u00eda\u2019s own forward calendar all point toward the election taking place on 8 March 2026 with no postponement, satisfying the \u201cbefore 9 March\u201d condition.\n\nRemaining information gaps  \nAll dates are documented, but some early-1990s citations rely on Wikipedia or IPU archives rather than scanned Gazette notices.  Should ultimate adjudication require an official Diario Oficial entry, those primary documents would need to be retrieved from the Colombian National Printing Office archives; however, for forecasting purposes the public primary sources above are generally treated as sufficient.</Agent_report>\n"
