  "plan_analysis": "The Wikipedia excerpt confirms the election is scheduled for 8 March 2026, but forecasters still need to gauge (a) how often Colombian or comparable elections slip, (b) the legal/constitutional rigidity of the date, and (c) any breaking indications\u2014security, logistical, political, or natural-disaster-related\u2014that might force a last-minute delay.  The plan therefore:\n\n1. Build a historical base rate of Colombian and peer-country election postponements.\n2. Locate the legal provisions that lock the date (or allow suspension) so forecasters know the hurdle for any change.\n3. Capture current-week news from Colombian authorities, election agencies, and security actors (e.g., ELN, CNE, Registradur\u00eda Nacional) about election readiness or threats.\n4. Run a contrarian check for postponement rumours or emergency declarations.\n5. Use one Agent query to pull a compact history of Colombian national elections vs. schedule\u2014quickly surfacing any prior deviations.",
