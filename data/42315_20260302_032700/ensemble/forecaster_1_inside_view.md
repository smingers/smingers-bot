Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **LM Arena Search Leaderboard (Feb 25, 2026)** – High quality, near-contemporary snapshot from the official arena.ai site. However, this is the *Search Arena*, not the *Text Arena Overall* specified in resolution criteria. Shows Anthropic #1 (1255), Google #4-5 (1218/1214). Limited direct relevance but indicates Google is competitive but not leading on Search Arena.

2. **Manifold Markets prediction market** – Low-to-moderate quality. Crowd-sourced betting, not authoritative. Useful only for confirming the resolution mechanism (LM Arena leaderboard) and that this is a recurring tracked question. No actual rankings provided.

3. **Vertu/Metavertu open-source LLM leaderboard** – Low quality. Commercial retail website, covers only open-source models, no Gemini appears. Not directly relevant to the resolution criteria (proprietary Text Arena).

4. **Builtin.com Gemini overview** – Moderate quality. Confirms Gemini 3.1 Pro exists as of early 2026, achieving 77.1% on ARC-AGI-2. No Arena rankings. Useful only for confirming Google's continued model development trajectory.

5. **VentureBeat/Opal article** – Low-to-moderate quality. Unnamed author, blog-style. Confirms Gemini 3 Flash exists and is being used in enterprise tools. No Arena rankings.

6. **CNBC (Feb 26, 2026)** – High quality source. Confirms Gemini 3 Pro existed as of November 2025 (Nano Banana Pro built on it). Indirect confirmation of Google's active model development.

7. **AskNews articles on Anthropic** – Multiple high-quality sources (CNBC, TechRadar, eWeek, Winbuzzer, CNET, Hindustan Times). Key facts:
   - Claude Opus 4.6 released February 5, 2026
   - Claude Sonnet 4.6 released February 17, 2026
   - Anthropic is #1 on Apple App Store as of March 1, 2026
   - Anthropic facing US government ban (supply chain risk designation Feb 28, 2026)
   - Anthropic's RSP modified March 1, 2026
   - Strong enterprise momentum, $380B valuation

The outside view analysis references additional sources not in the current information set (openlm.ai showing Gemini-3.1-Pro at #1, Wikipedia confirming Gemini 3.1 Pro release Feb 19, 2026, Gemini API changelog). These are referenced in the outside view but I should treat the openlm.ai source with caution as it was flagged as potentially speculative.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **LM Arena Text Arena snapshot (Feb 26, 2026)**: The outside view analysis synthesizes a Feb 26 snapshot showing Anthropic at #1 (1503±8), #2 (1503±7), Google at #3 (1500±9). This is the most directly relevant data point. The 3-Elo gap is within overlapping confidence intervals. This is strong evidence that the race is essentially tied, with Anthropic having a marginal edge.

- **Gemini 3.1 Pro release date (Feb 19, 2026)**: Confirmed by Gemini API changelog (referenced in outside view). The model was released only 7 days before the Feb 26 snapshot, with only ~4,052 votes vs Anthropic's 6,583-7,454. New models on Arena typically have higher variance scores that stabilize as votes accumulate. This is strong evidence that Gemini 3.1 Pro's score may shift as more votes come in — either up or down.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Historical pattern of Google at #1**: Google has been competitive at #1 since approximately November 2025, often in ties with Anthropic. The outside view notes ~18% of all-time days but ~50% of recent days in ties. This suggests the current competitive landscape is different from the historical average.

- **Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 releases (Feb 5 and 17, 2026)**: These are Anthropic's most recent models. Opus 4.6 has been accumulating votes since early February and appears to be holding #1. This is moderate evidence that Anthropic's lead, while small, is real and not just noise.

- **Anthropic's surge in popularity (March 1, 2026)**: The government controversy paradoxically boosted Claude's user base (60%+ increase in free users, doubled paid subscribers). More users = more Arena votes for Claude models, potentially reinforcing Anthropic's position.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **openlm.ai showing Gemini-3.1-Pro at #1 (1505 Elo)**: This source was flagged as potentially speculative/AI-generated in the outside view. If credible, it would strongly suggest Google is already at #1. But given the uncertainty, I treat this as weak-to-moderate evidence.

- **Search Arena showing Google at #4-5**: Indirect evidence. Different leaderboard from resolution criteria. Suggests Google is not leading on Search Arena but doesn't directly inform Text Arena.

- **Anthropic's RSP modification and government controversy**: Reputational/political factors don't directly affect Arena rankings, which are based on user preference votes.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- Resolution: March 15, 2026 — approximately 13 days from the question opening date (March 2, 2026).
- The most recent reliable data point (Feb 26 Text Arena snapshot) is 17 days before resolution.
- **If timeframe halved (~6-7 days)**: The Feb 26 snapshot would be even more predictive. The status quo (Anthropic at #1 by 3 Elo points) would be more likely to persist. I'd shift toward ~40% for Google.
- **If timeframe doubled (~26 days)**: More time for Gemini 3.1 Pro to accumulate votes and potentially climb, or for new models to be released. More uncertainty, potentially shifting toward 50/50.
- 13 days is a meaningful window. New frontier models often see score changes in the first few weeks as the vote distribution stabilizes.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting point: 45% outside view**

The outside view established ~45% based on:
- Google at #3 but within MoE of #1 (3 Elo gap, overlapping CIs)
- Gemini 3.1 Pro is a new model still accumulating votes
- Historical ~50% of recent days in ties with Anthropic
- Uncertainty from openlm.ai source

**Adjustments from current information:**

1. **Anthropic's surge in popularity** (moderate evidence, downward adjustment for Google): The government controversy has dramatically boosted Claude's user base. More users = more Arena votes for Claude models. This could reinforce Anthropic's current marginal lead. However, Arena votes come from users who specifically visit the Arena platform, not just Claude users generally. The effect may be limited. Small downward adjustment: -2%.

2. **Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Feb 17, 2026)** (moderate evidence, downward adjustment for Google): Anthropic released a strong new model just 2 days before Gemini 3.1 Pro. Both models are new and accumulating votes simultaneously. The competition is genuinely tight. No strong directional signal. Neutral.

3. **Gemini 3.1 Pro's low vote count** (moderate evidence, slight upward adjustment for Google): With only ~4,052 votes vs Anthropic's 6,500+, Gemini 3.1 Pro's score has higher variance and may shift more as votes accumulate. New models on Arena often have inflated initial scores that can go either way. The fact that it's already at 1500 with fewer votes suggests it may be genuinely competitive. Small upward adjustment: +2%.

4. **The 3-Elo gap is within MoE** (strong evidence, neutral): This is essentially a statistical tie. The question of who holds #1 on March 15 is close to a coin flip between Anthropic and Google, with small probability of xAI or OpenAI jumping ahead.

5. **No evidence of imminent Google model release**: Unlike the Gemini 3.1 Pro release on Feb 19, there's no evidence of another Google model release between now and March 15 that could dramatically shift rankings. Similarly, no evidence of a new Anthropic model release. Status quo likely to persist with gradual vote accumulation.

**Net adjustment**: Approximately neutral, slight downward due to Anthropic's popularity surge. Final estimate: ~43-45%.

**Probability Calibration:**

The key insight is that this is essentially a statistical tie on the leaderboard as of the most recent reliable data. The question resolves based on a single day's snapshot (March 15). Given:
- Anthropic has a marginal 3-Elo lead (within MoE)
- Google's new model is still accumulating votes
- The competition has been extremely tight for months
- No strong signals of a decisive shift in either direction

The probability distribution for who holds #1 on March 15 is approximately:
- Anthropic: ~50-55%
- Google: ~40-45%
- xAI/OpenAI: ~5-10%

I'll set my final estimate at **43%** for Google holding #1 on March 15.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will a Google Gemini model be ranked #1 on the LM Arena Text Arena Overall leaderboard on March 15, 2026, by Arena score?
   ✓ Aligned with resolution criteria.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 45% (Google at #3 but within MoE of #1, new model trajectory, recent competitive history).
   ✓ Final prediction (43%) is close to base rate with minor adjustments.

3. **Consistency check**: "43 out of 100 times, a Google Gemini model holds #1 on LM Arena Text Arena on March 15, 2026." This makes sense given the near-tie situation with Anthropic slightly ahead.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - Feb 26 snapshot: Anthropic leads by 3 Elo (within MoE) — factually supported by outside view analysis
   - Gemini 3.1 Pro released Feb 19 with only ~4,052 votes — factually supported by changelog
   - Anthropic user surge from government controversy — factually supported by multiple news sources
   - Historical ~50% of recent days Google in ties at #1 — supported by outside view synthesis
   - No imminent new model releases from either side — absence of evidence

5. **Blind spot**: If Gemini 3.1 Pro has already climbed to #1 by March 2 (the openlm.ai source suggests this), then the status quo would favor Google holding #1 on March 15. This scenario would push probability toward 60%+. However, the openlm.ai source is flagged as potentially unreliable.

6. **Status quo**: The status quo as of Feb 26 is Anthropic at #1 by 3 Elo points. Given the slow-moving nature of leaderboard rankings and the 13-day window, the status quo slightly favors Anthropic maintaining #1. This supports keeping the estimate below 50%.

Probability calibration:
Starting at 45% outside view, with minor downward adjustments from Anthropic's popularity surge (+user base → more Arena votes) and the Feb 26 status quo showing Anthropic marginally ahead. The openlm.ai source (weak evidence) provides a slight upward counterbalance. Net result: ~43%.

Checklist:
1. ✓ Google Gemini #1 on LM Arena Text Arena Overall on March 15, 2026
2. ✓ Base rate 45%, final 43% — minor adjustment justified
3. ✓ "43 out of 100 times, a Gemini model holds #1 on March 15" — consistent with near-tie analysis
4. Key evidence: Feb 26 snapshot (Anthropic +3 Elo), Gemini 3.1 Pro new/low votes, Anthropic user surge, recent competitive history, no new model releases expected
5. Blind spot: If openlm.ai source is accurate and Gemini is already #1, probability should be ~60%
6. Status quo (Anthropic at #1 by 3 Elo) slightly favors No resolution

Probability: 43%
