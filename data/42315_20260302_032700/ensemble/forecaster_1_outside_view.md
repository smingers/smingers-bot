Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **LM Arena Leaderboard (Feb 26, 2026)** – High quality, near-contemporary snapshot. Shows Anthropic at #1 and #2 (both 1503±7-8), Google at #3 (1500±9). The scores are extremely close, within margin of error. This is the most directly relevant data point—13 days before resolution.

2. **openlm.ai leaderboard** – Flagged as potentially speculative/AI-generated with model names like "Gemini-3.1-Pro" and "Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking." However, these model names are consistent with the Wikipedia/changelog sources confirming Gemini 3.1 Pro was released Feb 19, 2026. Shows Gemini-3.1-Pro at #1 with 1505 Elo. Treat with moderate skepticism but note consistency with other sources.

3. **Vellum LLM Leaderboard (Dec 15, 2025)** – Benchmark-based, not Arena-based. Shows Gemini 3 Pro competitive on benchmarks. Indirect relevance only.

4. **Actrix (March 2025)** – Historical snapshot showing Grok-3 and GPT-4.5 at top in March 2025. Useful for historical context only.

5. **WaveSpeed AI (Dec 2026)** – Speculative/future-dated, text-to-image focused. Not directly relevant.

6. **Agent Report on historical #1 frequency** – Synthesizes multiple sources. Key finding: Google has never held #1 *solely* (always in tie), accumulated ~175 credited days out of 956 total. Anthropic has ~345 credited days, OpenAI ~730. As of Jan 4, 2026, Google and Anthropic are tied at #1 (Gemini-3.1-Pro and Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking).

7. **Wikipedia on Gemini** – Confirms Gemini 3.1 Pro released Feb 19, 2026. Consistent with changelog.

8. **Gemini API Changelog** – Confirms Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview released Feb 19, 2026. Authoritative.

9. **Arena FAQ** – Explains methodology (Bradley-Terry). No ranking data.

10. **t-redactyl.io critique** – Discusses Arena biases and limitations. Notes that 10% random/malicious voting can shift rankings by 5 places.

**Key synthesis:** As of Feb 26, 2026 (13 days before resolution), Anthropic holds #1 and #2, Google holds #3. The gap is 3 Elo points (1503 vs 1500), which is within the margin of error (±7-9). The openlm.ai source (possibly speculative but internally consistent) shows Gemini-3.1-Pro at #1 with 1505. There's genuine ambiguity about who leads.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

**Reference Class 1: Days Google held #1 on Arena historically**
- Google has held #1 (in ties) for ~175/956 days = ~18% of the time since Arena launched.
- However, this is skewed by OpenAI's early dominance. In recent months (Nov 2025–Feb 2026), Google has been at or near #1 consistently.

**Reference Class 2: Stability of #1 position over 2-week windows**
- The leaderboard changes frequently but not daily. A 13-day window is short enough that the current leader often remains.
- As of Feb 26, Anthropic is technically #1 but Google is within margin of error.

**Reference Class 3: Competitive frontier model releases**
- Gemini 3.1 Pro was just released Feb 19, 2026 (7 days before the Feb 26 snapshot). New models often climb the leaderboard as they accumulate votes. Google's #3 position with only 4,052 votes (vs Anthropic's 6,583 and 7,454) suggests the Gemini 3.1 Pro model is newer and still climbing.

**Most suitable:** Reference Class 3 combined with the current snapshot. The recency of Gemini 3.1 Pro's release and its position within margin of error of #1 is most informative.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- Resolution is March 15, 2026 — 13 days from the question opening (March 2, 2026).
- The Feb 26 snapshot shows Google at #3 but within statistical error of #1.
- Historical pattern: When models are within margin of error, small vote accumulations can shift rankings. Gemini 3.1 Pro has far fewer votes (4,052) than the Anthropic models (6,583-7,454), meaning its score will stabilize and potentially shift as more votes come in.
- The openlm.ai source (if credible) suggests Gemini-3.1-Pro may have already reached #1 by some point after Feb 26.
- 13 days is enough time for rankings to shift, especially with a new model accumulating votes.

**(d) Justification**

The key facts:
1. As of Feb 26, 2026, Google is at #3 with 1500±9, vs Anthropic at #1 with 1503±8. The gap is 3 points, well within overlapping confidence intervals.
2. Gemini 3.1 Pro was released Feb 19, 2026 — only 7 days before the snapshot. It has only 4,052 votes vs Anthropic's 6,583-7,454. As votes accumulate, the score will stabilize; new frontier models often climb initially.
3. The openlm.ai source (despite uncertainty about its provenance) shows Gemini-3.1-Pro at #1 with 1505 Elo, which is consistent with the trajectory.
4. Historical pattern: Google has been competitive at #1 since Nov 2025, often in ties with Anthropic.
5. The competition is extremely tight — Anthropic could maintain #1 or Google could overtake.

The question asks specifically about March 15, 2026. Given:
- Google is 3 Elo points behind with overlapping CIs
- Gemini 3.1 Pro is a brand new model still accumulating votes
- Historical tendency for new Google models to climb
- The openlm.ai source (speculative but consistent) showing Google at #1
- The 13-day window allows for ranking changes

The probability that Google holds #1 on March 15 is meaningful but not certain. Anthropic currently leads and has strong models. The race is very tight.

Outside view calibration:

- Base rate from history: Google at #1 ~18% of all days, but ~50% of recent days (Nov 2025-Feb 2026 in ties with Anthropic).
- Current position: #3 but within MoE of #1. This is a near-tie situation.
- New model trajectory: Gemini 3.1 Pro likely to gain votes and potentially climb.
- Uncertainty: The Feb 26 snapshot is the most reliable data; openlm.ai is uncertain.
- The scores are so close (3 Elo points) that this is essentially a coin flip between Anthropic and Google for #1, with small probability of another provider (xAI, OpenAI) jumping ahead.

If it's roughly 50/50 between Anthropic and Google for the top spot, with ~10% chance of another provider (xAI at 1495, OpenAI at 1481) taking #1, then Google's probability is approximately 45-50%.

However, I should weight the Feb 26 snapshot more heavily (Anthropic currently leads) while acknowledging the new model trajectory. I'll estimate ~45% probability for Google at #1 on March 15.
