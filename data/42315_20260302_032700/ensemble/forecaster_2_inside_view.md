Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **arena.ai/leaderboard/search (Feb 25, 2026)** – Direct platform data, 5 days old. High quality. Shows Search Arena (not Text Arena), with Anthropic #1 (1255), Google at #4 and #5 (~1218/1214). This is the wrong leaderboard for resolution but provides directional signal about competitive positioning.

2. **builtin.com Gemini overview** – General explainer confirming Gemini 3.1 Pro exists as of early 2026 with strong benchmark performance (77.1% ARC-AGI-2). No leaderboard data. Moderate quality for confirming Google's active model development.

3. **venturebeat.com Opal article** – Confirms Gemini 3 Flash is in active enterprise deployment. Mentions Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 as competitive benchmarks. Low direct relevance to leaderboard rankings.

4. **CNBC Nano Banana 2 (Feb 26, 2026)** – Confirms Gemini 3 Pro exists and is actively used in Google products. No leaderboard data. Moderate quality.

5. **vertu.com open-source leaderboard** – Commercial/retail site listing open-source models only. No Gemini models appear. Low reliability; not comparable to official LM Arena. Weak evidence.

6. **Manifold Markets prediction market** – Crowd-sourced prediction market for "which company leads LM Arena on March 31, 2026." No current standings. Provides procedural context only. Low direct evidentiary value but confirms the market exists and is tracked.

7. **AskNews: Anthropic Claude upgrade articles (multiple, Feb 2026)** – Multiple reliable sources (CNET, eWeek, Investing.com) confirm Claude Opus 4.6 launched Feb 5, 2026 and Claude Sonnet 4.6 launched Feb 17, 2026. These are recent, significant model releases that would boost Anthropic's Arena scores through fresh user voting. High quality, directly relevant.

8. **AskNews: Anthropic controversy articles (Feb-Mar 2026)** – Multiple sources confirm Anthropic faced major political controversy (Pentagon dispute, Trump designation as "supply chain risk" on Feb 28). Paradoxically, this boosted Claude's user base (+60% free users, #1 App Store). High quality, potentially relevant to Arena voting patterns.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Anthropic's recent model releases (Opus 4.6, Feb 5; Sonnet 4.6, Feb 17)** represent fresh, high-capability models released just 2-4 weeks before resolution. New model releases consistently generate Arena score bumps due to novelty-driven user voting. This is a direct causal mechanism favoring Anthropic maintaining or extending its lead. The Search Arena snapshot showing Anthropic at #1 with a ~37 Elo gap over Google (1255 vs 1218) is consistent with Anthropic having a meaningful lead.

- **Historical leaderboard stability**: The outside view analysis established that turnovers happen ~once per 200 days in mature arena operation (~0.5% per day). Over 13 days, that's ~6-7% base probability of any change. This is strong historical evidence for status quo persistence.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro (released ~Feb 19, 2026)** is also a recent release that could be accruing votes. However, the Search Arena data (Feb 25) shows Google still well behind Anthropic despite this release, suggesting the Gemini 3.1 Pro bump hasn't been sufficient to close the gap.

- **Anthropic's viral controversy and user surge**: The Pentagon dispute drove record signups and Claude becoming #1 on the App Store. More users = more Arena votes = stronger score reinforcement. This is a moderate positive factor for Anthropic maintaining #1.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Vertu.com open-source leaderboard** showing Chinese models (GLM-5, Kimi K2.5) at top positions. This is a different leaderboard and unreliable source. Minimal weight.

- **Gemini 3.1 Pro's ARC-AGI-2 score (77.1%)** suggests strong capabilities, but benchmark performance doesn't directly translate to Arena voting preferences.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

Resolution is March 15, 2026 – **13 days from today** (March 2, 2026).

The outside view established ~10% probability based on:
- ~10-11% chance of any leadership change in 13 days
- ~60% chance that change would favor Google
- Net: ~6-7% + ~3% for statistical tie scenarios = ~10%

If the timeframe were halved to ~6-7 days: probability would drop to ~5-6% (fewer opportunities for vote accumulation to shift rankings).

If the timeframe were doubled to ~26 days: probability would rise to ~15-18% (more time for a new Gemini release or vote accumulation to close the gap).

The 13-day window is short enough that status quo persistence is the dominant factor.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view baseline of 10% must now be adjusted based on inside-view evidence:

**Factors pushing DOWN (toward lower probability):**
1. The Search Arena snapshot (Feb 25, 2026) shows Anthropic leading Google by ~37 Elo points (1255 vs 1218). While this is the Search Arena (not Text Arena), it's directionally consistent with the outside view analysis that placed Google at rank 3 in Text Arena, ~3 Elo behind. However, the Search Arena gap is much larger, suggesting Anthropic's recent model releases have had substantial impact.

2. Anthropic released TWO major models in February (Opus 4.6 on Feb 5, Sonnet 4.6 on Feb 17), both within 2-4 weeks of resolution. These fresh releases are still accumulating votes and likely still boosting Anthropic's scores. The momentum is clearly with Anthropic.

3. Anthropic's viral controversy paradoxically boosted user engagement dramatically (+60% free users, #1 App Store). More engaged users = more Arena votes = stronger score reinforcement for Anthropic. This is a structural advantage that will persist through March 15.

4. No evidence of an imminent Gemini release that would generate a comparable voting surge before March 15.

**Factors pushing UP (toward higher probability):**
1. Gemini 3.1 Pro was released ~Feb 19 and is still early in its vote accumulation cycle. If it's genuinely superior in user preference, it could still be climbing.

2. The outside view analysis noted that the Text Arena gap was only ~3 Elo (much smaller than the Search Arena gap of ~37 Elo), suggesting the Text Arena competition may be closer.

**Net assessment:**
The inside view evidence substantially favors Anthropic maintaining its lead. The combination of:
- Two recent major model releases (Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6) still accruing votes
- Massive user base surge from controversy
- No imminent Gemini release catalyst
- The Search Arena showing a large gap

...suggests the Text Arena gap is likely also meaningful, not just 3 Elo. The outside view's 10% baseline was based on a 3 Elo gap; the inside view suggests the actual gap may be larger, warranting a downward revision.

I revise from 10% to approximately **7%**.

**Probability Calibration**

The status quo (Anthropic at #1) is strongly supported by:
- Recent model releases with ongoing vote accumulation
- Massive user surge
- Historical stability of leaderboard positions

The 7% estimate reflects:
- Small but non-zero chance Gemini 3.1 Pro's votes accumulate faster than expected
- Small chance of a new Gemini release before March 15
- Statistical noise in Arena scoring

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria**: Will a Google Gemini model be #1 on LM Arena Text Overall leaderboard on March 15, 2026? Yes/No based on single-day snapshot.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 10% (Google not currently #1, ~10% chance of turnover in 13 days). My final prediction of 7% is slightly below this, justified by inside-view evidence of Anthropic's stronger momentum.

3. **Consistency check**: "7 out of 100 times, a Gemini model holds the #1 spot on March 15, 2026." This makes sense given Anthropic's recent releases, user surge, and historical leaderboard stability.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Anthropic released Opus 4.6 (Feb 5) and Sonnet 4.6 (Feb 17) – both recent, vote-accruing releases ✓
   - Anthropic's user base surged dramatically in February 2026 due to controversy ✓
   - Search Arena shows Anthropic leading Google by ~37 Elo (Feb 25) ✓
   - Historical leaderboard turnovers occur ~once per 200 days ✓
   - No announced Gemini release before March 15 ✓

5. **Blind spot**: If Gemini 3.1 Pro is dramatically superior in user preference and the Text Arena gap is actually very small (or already tied), the probability could be 30-40%. The Search Arena data might not reflect Text Arena dynamics accurately.

6. **Status quo**: Anthropic is #1. The world changes slowly. 13 days is a short window. Status quo persistence strongly favors No resolution.

Probability: 7%
