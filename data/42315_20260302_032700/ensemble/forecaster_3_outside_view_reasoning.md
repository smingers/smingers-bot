**Evaluating prediction methods**

I'm looking for a prediction for March 15, 2026, using data from March 2, 2026. The sources include the February 26 leaderboard with Anthropic in top positions and Google in third. I want to establish baseline frequencies of placements historically. 

Okay, I'm thinking that using recent standings is important, but I should focus on historical data and consider the volatility. The outside view typically excludes the latest news, relying more on reference classes. We can use the provider days where Google held the top spot—18.3% from the report.**Clarifying ranking data**

I'm analyzing the rankings to predict for March 15, 2026. The information I have is up to January 4, 2026, and doesn't include the last two months. A source from February 26 shows Google at rank 3, close to the top. Openlm.ai suggested Google tied at #1 on January 4, but I'm hesitant to fully trust that snapshot. It seems like February 26 from arena.ai is more reliable. 

I'll focus on the base rate of Google being #1 over the past year, especially considering its historical performance around major model releases. Since the upcoming date is just 13 days away, I don't expect big shifts in the leaderboard without new model announcements.**Assessing probability of ranking**

The probability of a Gemini model being #1 on March 15 relies on its current ranking and how stable it is. The outside view might suggest a 1/3 chance of it being the leader among the top three, considering their close scores. Historical volatility indicates that top positions change only a few times each year. So, the chance of a shift in the next 13 days is small—perhaps around 20-30%. 

I'll suggest an outside view prediction of about 35-45%. The status quo as of February 26 showed Anthropic at #1 and #2, with Google in 3rd. If we consider ties statistically, only the top position counts for the resolution. Since Google has been in the top position only 18% of the time, it never held that rank alone.**Interpreting ranking data**

The question specifically asks for the #1 rank row, not just the possibility of a statistical tie. If Google ties at the top, that's valid, particularly since it achieved at least a tie for #1 several times between February and June 2025, as well as November 2025 to January 2026. 

This means Google may have been displayed as #1 when slightly ahead in Elo rating. The data indicates that the base rate of Google being at the top from 2023 to 2026 is about 18%. However, I might want to consider the trends from the past year for a more accurate view.**Calculating likelihood of ranking**

Google’s probability of being #1 on March 15 is influenced by its current position and historical data. Between February 19, 2025, and January 4, 2026, Google held the top row for about 320 days, with 175 days as the leader (55%) compared to Anthropic's 145 days (45%). Recent snapshots suggest a possible return to Anthropic dominance.

Given the nature of leader changes, I estimate a 40% possibility for Google over the next 13 days. Historical patterns indicate that leaders often stay the same beyond 170 days, resulting in about a 7.6% chance of a leadership change in that short timeframe. However, considering the current standings, I'll refine the outside view estimate for Google’s chances to around 30.8%.
