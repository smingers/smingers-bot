**Reviewing schedule and predictions**

I need to check the upcoming schedule since we only have 13 days left. There's a possibility of a new Google release, perhaps "Gemini 3.2 Ultra," but I haven’t found any articles indicating it’s coming soon. They just released 3.1 Pro, so Ultra might be unveiled at I/O in May. For now, the changes in ranking seem to be mostly noise. I should adjust the probability for upcoming ranks downward to 28% and craft my answer with disclaimers.**Preparing source analysis**

I’m getting ready to analyze several sources relevant to our discussion. I have a snapshot from the arena.ai Search leaderboard that suggests Google isn’t in the top position. There's an open-source article about the Chatbot Arena scoreboard, but I have doubts about its accuracy. Other sources, like the builtin Gemini overview and articles from VentureBeat and CNBC, provide moderate background information. Also, there's data from the Manifold market that hints at trader expectations. The evidence seems moderate overall, and we need to consider the timeframe of 13 days, possibly adjusting that to 6 or 26 days. I’ll finalize the thought process with a probability of 28%.
