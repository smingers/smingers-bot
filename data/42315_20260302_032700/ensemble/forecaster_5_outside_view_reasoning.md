**Evaluating model prediction**

I'm tasked with predicting the likelihood that a Google Gemini model will rank #1 on the LM Arena leaderboard by March 15, 2026. Today is March 2, 2026, so I'm using an outside view, which doesn't consider internal news but relies on historical data. It’s important to note that Google has never held the sole #1 position but has tied for it. Therefore, as long as it shares the top rank, it counts. So, I need to focus on their historical performance while considering the criteria for ranking.**Calculating tie probabilities**

I’m analyzing if a Google Gemini model will rank #1 with ties by March 15, 2026, using historical data. Historically, Google has tied for #1 for about 175 days between early 2025 and since November 2025. Given the total data of 956 days, this gives an 18.3% chance of any model being in the top tie. In the past few months, Google has maintained that tie, so I might estimate a probability of around 60-65% for maintaining that status on the target date, treating this as an outside view.**Summarizing sources and probabilities**

I’m analyzing different sources to assess their quality, date, and whether they present facts or opinions. For instance, a snapshot from February 26, 2026, is high quality but lacks model specifics, while other sources range in reliability. Given the historical data, Google has been tied for #1 since November 4, 2025, but a recent snapshot suggests they’re currently ranked #3. Based on current overlap in scores and probability trends, I’d estimate a 55% chance of Google maintaining a tie near the top on March 15.
