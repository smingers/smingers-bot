Disagreement Analysis:

The forecasters' predictions range from 7% to 43%, with three major disagreements:

**Disagreement 1: What is the current state of the Text Arena Overall leaderboard?**
- Forecasters 1, 3 (42-43%) believe the Text Arena gap between Anthropic (#1) and Gemini (#3) is only ~3 Elo points with overlapping confidence intervals, making it essentially a statistical tie. They reference a "Feb 26 Text Arena snapshot" and an openlm.ai source possibly showing Gemini at #1.
- Forecasters 2, 4, 5 (7-26%) are more skeptical about these claims, noting that the only verified primary-source data is from the Search Arena (not Text Arena), where Anthropic leads Google by ~37 Elo points. Forecaster 2 explicitly notes the Search Arena gap is much larger than the claimed Text Arena gap.
- **Impact**: This is the single largest driver of disagreement. If the Text Arena gap is truly ~3 Elo, probabilities should be 35-50%. If it's closer to the Search Arena gap (~37 Elo), probabilities should be 5-15%.

**Disagreement 2: Base rate for leaderboard turnover / Google's historical share of #1**
- Forecasters 1, 3 use a base rate suggesting Google has held #1 ~50% of recent days (in ties), leading to a ~45% outside-view anchor.
- Forecaster 4 uses ~30.8% (blending 18% lifetime with 55% recent era).
- Forecasters 2, 5 use ~10% base rate, anchoring on leaderboard turnover frequency (~0.5% per day) rather than Google's historical share.
- **Impact**: ~15-20 percentage points of spread.

**Disagreement 3: Effect of Anthropic's recent model releases and user surge**
- Forecasters 2, 4, 5 weight Anthropic's Claude 4.6 releases (Feb 5 and Feb 17) and massive user surge heavily, arguing these create strong momentum for Anthropic maintaining #1.
- Forecasters 1, 3 acknowledge these factors but give them minimal weight, arguing Arena rankings depend on pairwise preference quality, not popularity.
- **Impact**: ~5-10 percentage points.

Root Causes:

1. **Different factual beliefs** (verifiable): The core dispute is what the actual Text Arena Overall leaderboard currently shows. The "Feb 26 Text Arena snapshot" and openlm.ai data referenced by some forecasters may or may not be accurate. No forecaster has a verified, direct screenshot of the Text Arena Overall leaderboard. This is the most impactful disagreement and is resolvable with research.

2. **Different base rate assumptions** (partially verifiable, partially judgment): Forecasters disagree on whether to anchor on "Google's historical share of #1 days" vs. "probability of any turnover in a 13-day window." This is partly a methodological choice but could be informed by historical data.

3. **Different weighting of the same evidence** (judgment-based): All forecasters acknowledge Anthropic's recent releases and user surge; they simply weight the impact differently. This is not easily resolvable via search.
