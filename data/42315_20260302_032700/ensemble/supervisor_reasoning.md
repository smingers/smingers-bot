**Disagreement 1 (Most Critical): What is the current state of the Text Arena Overall leaderboard?**

The targeted research strongly supports the side of forecasters 1 and 3 who claimed the gap was very small, and in fact goes further — multiple sources now indicate **Gemini 3.1 Pro is currently #1** on the Text Arena Overall leaderboard:

1. **Agent report** citing openlm.ai and aidevdayindia.org confirms Gemini-3.1-Pro at #1 with 1505 Elo, Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking at #2 with 1503 Elo (a 2-point gap).
2. **whatllm.org article** explicitly states "Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview holds the #1 position on LM Arena" as of February 2026.
3. **Onyx.app leaderboard** shows Gemini 3 Pro with the highest listed Arena score (1492) among models with scores listed, though this appears to be an older snapshot before Gemini 3.1 Pro was added.
4. **LM Arena changelog** confirms gemini-3.1-pro-preview was added to the Text leaderboard on February 19, 2026.

The evidence supports forecasters 1 and 3's position that the competition is extremely tight, and actually goes beyond it — Gemini appears to currently hold #1, not just be within striking distance. The Search Arena gap of ~37 Elo that forecasters 2, 4, and 5 relied on was from a different leaderboard and does not reflect the Text Arena situation.

**Disagreement 2: Base rate for Google's position**
This is partially resolved. If Gemini is currently #1, the relevant question becomes "will it maintain #1 over 13 days?" rather than "will it overtake Anthropic?" This fundamentally changes the framing and supports a higher probability.

**Disagreement 3: Effect of Anthropic's releases and user surge**
Not directly resolved by research, but the fact that Gemini holds #1 despite Anthropic's recent releases suggests these factors were insufficient to prevent Gemini from reaching the top.

Updated Analysis:

The key finding is that **Gemini 3.1 Pro appears to currently hold the #1 position** on the Text Arena Overall leaderboard with a 2-Elo lead over Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking. This dramatically changes the calculus:

- The question is now about **status quo persistence** (Gemini maintaining #1) rather than **overtaking** (Gemini climbing to #1).
- A 2-Elo lead is extremely small and within noise, meaning the position could easily flip back and forth.
- However, status quo bias in leaderboard rankings means the current leader has an advantage.
- Gemini 3.1 Pro was added Feb 19 and is still accumulating votes; its score could stabilize higher or lower.
- No evidence of an imminent new Anthropic or other competitor release before March 15.
- The whatllm.org article describes Gemini 3.1 Pro as having strong benchmark performance across multiple dimensions, suggesting its Arena position is backed by genuine capability.

**Caveats on source quality:** The openlm.ai source and whatllm.org article could potentially be speculative or AI-generated content. However, the convergence of multiple independent sources (openlm.ai, aidevdayindia, whatllm.org, plus the LM Arena changelog confirming the model was added) increases confidence that Gemini 3.1 Pro is indeed at or very near #1.

Given that Gemini appears to currently hold #1 with a tiny lead:
- Status quo persistence over 13 days favors Yes
- But the 2-Elo gap means daily fluctuations could easily change the leader
- The probability should be meaningfully above 50% if Gemini is currently #1, but not dramatically so given the razor-thin margin
- I estimate ~55% probability, reflecting: current #1 status (favoring Yes), tiny margin (adding uncertainty), 13-day window (moderate time for fluctuation), and no imminent competitor releases (slightly favoring status quo)

However, I need to discount somewhat for uncertainty about whether these sources accurately reflect the official arena.ai/leaderboard/text page, as none of the research directly accessed that URL successfully. I'll adjust down slightly to ~50%.

Confidence: MEDIUM

Probability: 50%
