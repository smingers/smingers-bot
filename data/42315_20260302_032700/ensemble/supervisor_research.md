## Summary

**Disclaimer:** This article appears to be from a commercial/retail website (Metavertu) and focuses on **open-source LLM rankings**, not the LMSYS/LM Arena proprietary model leaderboard. It is only tangentially relevant to the forecasting question, as it references Chatbot Arena scores but does not specifically address Google Gemini's standing on the official LM Arena leaderboard.

---

### Key Content Relevant to the Question

The article presents a tiered open-source LLM leaderboard for 2026, pulling benchmark data including **Chatbot Arena scores**. Notably, **no Google Gemini models appear anywhere in the rankings** — the leaderboard is dominated by Chinese AI labs (Zhipu AI, Moonshot, MiniMax, DeepSeek, Qwen/Alibaba, Step).

**Top Chatbot Arena scores cited among open-source models:**
- GLM-5: **1,451**
- Kimi K2.5: **1,447**
- GLM-4.7: **1,445**
- Qwen 3 235B: **1,422**
- DeepSeek V3.2: **1,421**
- MiMo-V2-Flash: **1,401**
- DeepSeek R1: **1,398**

The article makes no mention of Google Gemini models in any tier, suggesting (within this source's framing) that Gemini is not competitive among the open-source models evaluated — though this leaderboard explicitly covers **open-source models only**, which is a critical limitation for the forecasting question.

## Summary

**Disclaimer:** This article is from the **Text-to-Image Arena leaderboard**, which ranks AI image generation models — not text/language models. This is **not** the Text Arena Overall leaderboard referenced in the forecasting question, and therefore has limited direct relevance to the question about Gemini ranking #1 on the text LLM leaderboard.

---

### Key Facts from the Article (Text-to-Image Arena, as of ~Feb 25, 2026):

- The leaderboard reflects **4,061,062 votes** across **50 models**
- **Google holds the #1 position** in the Text-to-Image Arena with an Arena score of **1280 (±12)**, though the specific model name is not listed in the extracted content (only "Google · Proprietary" is shown)
- Google models also appear at ranks **3, 4, 11, 14, 18, 34, and 45**, indicating strong overall presence
- OpenAI holds rank #2 (score: 1248), and another Google model is at rank #3 (score: 1238)
- The top Google image model has a notably high score spread (rank spread of 1–11), suggesting some uncertainty due to relatively fewer votes (2,965) compared to other models

### Relevance Note:
This data pertains exclusively to **image generation** performance and does **not** reflect standings on the **text/LLM leaderboard** that the forecasting question concerns.

<Agent_report>
Query: What is the current #1 model on the LM Arena Text Arena Overall leaderboard (at arena.ai/leaderboard/text or lmarena-ai on HuggingFace) as of late February or early March 2026? Specifically, what are the top 5 models and their Arena scores, and is any Google Gemini model currently ranked #1 or within 5 Elo points of #1?
Available leaderboard snapshots for late-February / early-March 2026 all show the same ordering at the very top of the LMSYS “Text Arena – Overall” (a.k.a. Chatbot Arena) leaderboard.

Top 5 models and their Arena Elo scores  
(as displayed on arena.ai/leaderboard/text in late Feb-early Mar 2026)

1. Gemini-3.1-Pro – 1505 Elo (openlm.ai leaderboard dump; Aidevdayindia Feb 22 2026 confirms the same value) (openlm.ai/chatbot-arena; aidevdayindia.org/blogs/lmsys-chatbot-arena-current-rankings…)  
2. Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking – 1503 Elo (openlm.ai/chatbot-arena)  
3. Grok-4.20 – 1493 Elo (openlm.ai/chatbot-arena)  
4. Gemini-3-Pro – 1492 Elo (openlm.ai/chatbot-arena)  
5. Claude Opus 4.6 – 1490 Elo (openlm.ai/chatbot-arena)

Key points relative to the query

• The #1 position is held by a Google Gemini model, Gemini-3.1-Pro, with an Arena Elo of 1505.  
• Therefore a Google Gemini model is not merely “within 5 Elo points of #1” — it actually is #1.  
• No other Gemini variant sits within 5 Elo points of the top slot; Gemini-3-Pro at 1492 is 13 Elo behind #1.  
• Competitors closest to dethroning Gemini-3.1-Pro are Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking (-2 Elo) and Grok-4.20 (-12 Elo).

Conclusion

As of late February / early March 2026 the Text Arena Overall leaderboard is led by Gemini-3.1-Pro at 1505 Elo. Google’s Gemini family therefore occupies the #1 spot, satisfying the “within 5 Elo” criterion by definition.</Agent_report>
