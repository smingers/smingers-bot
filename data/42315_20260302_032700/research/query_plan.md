Analysis:
The snapshot supplied shows Google very close to #1 today (Feb 26 2026) but still behind Anthropic. Forecasters now need:  
• Base-rate evidence – how often (and for how long) Google/Gemini or any provider has actually held #1 on LM Arena since the leaderboard was launched; frequency and timing of lead changes.  
• Resolution-mechanism details – exactly how Arena score is calculated, how often it updates, and how model names/providers are displayed (so forecasters know what qualifies as “Gemini” and how quickly a new model can appear).  
• Key drivers – whether Google will ship an upgraded Gemini model (e.g., “Ultra 2”) or big tuning push before 15 Mar; likewise whether Anthropic/OpenAI/xAI will counter with their own upgrades.  
• Current state – the very latest leaderboard snapshot (has Google already edged ahead?); any fresh news/rumours of imminent Gemini releases; any reports of Anthropic improvements.  
• Contrarian check – reasons Google might *not* overtake (e.g., evidence of upcoming Anthropic Claude upgrade, voting-pattern quirks, or slower Arena score convergence).

The eight queries below collectively cover those dimensions. Five are historical (base rate, mechanism, release timelines) and three are current (brand-new launches, present leaderboard standings, competitor moves). Exactly one Agent query is used for the quantitative base-rate analysis.
