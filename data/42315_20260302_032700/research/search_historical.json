The model names are not explicitly listed (only providers and licenses are visible in the extracted data), which limits full identification of specific model names.\n\n### Key Facts from the Leaderboard\n\n**Top 10 Rankings by Arena Score:**\n| Rank | Provider | Score | Votes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 1 | Anthropic \u00b7 Proprietary | 1503\u00b18 | 6,583 |\n| 2 | Anthropic \u00b7 Proprietary | 1503\u00b17 | 7,454 |\n| 3 | **Google \u00b7 Proprietary** | 1500\u00b19 | 4,052 |\n| 4 | xAI \u00b7 Proprietary | 1495\u00b110 | 3,818 |\n| 5 | **Google \u00b7 Proprietary** | 1486\u00b14 | 38,248 |\n| 6 | OpenAI \u00b7 Proprietary | 1481\u00b110 | 3,605 |\n| 7 | **Google \u00b7 Proprietary** | 1473\u00b15 | 29,334 |\n| 8 | xAI \u00b7 Proprietary | 1473\u00b14 | 37,474 |\n| 9 | Anthropic \u00b7 Proprietary | 1471\u00b14 | 30,541 |\n| 10 | ByteDance \u00b7 Proprietary | 1470\u00b19 | 4,620 |\n\n### Relevant Observations\n\n- **As of February 26, 2026**, the **#1 and #2 positions are held by Anthropic** models (both scoring 1503, within margin of error of each other).\n- **Google holds #3** (score: 1500\u00b19), very close to the top two Anthropic models but not in first place.\n- Google also holds **#5** (1486\u00b14) and **#7** (1473\u00b15) positions.\n- The scores for ranks 1\u20133 are extremely close (1503, 1503, 1500), meaning the gap between Anthropic (#1/#2) and Google (#3) is within or near the margin of error.\n- Google models (labeled \"Google \u00b7 Proprietary\") appear at ranks 3, 5, 7, 13, 22, and others further down. Some Google entries are labeled \"Google \u00b7 Gemma\" (e.g., ranks 110, 136, 167, 187, 194).\n- The specific Gemini model names are **not visible** in the extracted data \u2014 only provider labels are shown.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted leaderboard data does not display individual model names, only provider/license information. It is therefore not possible to confirm from this article alone whether the Google entries are specifically \"Gemini\"-branded models, though Google's top proprietary models on this leaderboard are widely understood to be from the Gemini family.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://openlm.ai/chatbot-arena/\">\n**Disclaimer:** This appears to be a leaderboard snapshot from what looks like a future or speculative/AI-generated leaderboard (given model names like \"Gemini-3.1-Pro,\" \"Claude Opus 4.6,\" \"GPT-5.2,\" etc. that do not currently exist as of my knowledge). The content may be fabricated, simulated, or from a future date. The extraction also appears incomplete (the table is cut off).\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Article Content\n\nThe article presents a leaderboard ranking large language models based on multiple benchmarks:\n- **Chatbot Arena** (crowdsourced head-to-head voting, 6M+ user votes, Elo ratings)\n- **AAII** (Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index v3, aggregating 10 evaluations)\n- **ARC-AGI v2** (fluid intelligence benchmark)\n\n### Top Rankings by Arena Elo Score:\n\n| Rank | Model | Arena Elo | Organization |\n|------|-------|-----------|--------------|\n| \ud83c\udfc6 #1 | **Gemini-3.1-Pro** | **1505** | Google (Proprietary) |\n| \ud83c\udfc6 #2 | Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking | 1503 | Anthropic |\n| \ud83c\udfc6 #3 | Grok-4.20 | 1493 | xAI |\n| \ud83c\udfc6 #4 | **Gemini-3-Pro** | 1492 | Google (Proprietary) |\n| \ud83c\udfc6 #5 | Claude Opus 4.6 | 1490 | Anthropic |\n\n### Key Observations from the Leaderboard:\n- **A Google Gemini model (Gemini-3.1-Pro) holds the #1 position** with an Arena Elo of 1505\n- A second Gemini model (Gemini-3-Pro) ranks #4 with 1492\n- Gemini-3-Flash appears at rank ~8 with 1470\n- Gemini-2.5-Pro appears further down with 1460\n- Older Gemini models (2.5-Flash, 2.0-Pro-Exp, 2.0-Flash variants) appear in lower tiers (Elo 1370\u20131412)\n- The leaderboard spans a wide range of organizations including Anthropic, xAI, OpenAI, ByteDance, DeepSeek, Alibaba, and others\n- Multiple Google/Gemini models appear across various tiers of the leaderboard\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.vellum.ai/llm-leaderboard\">\n**Disclaimer:** This article is from Vellum's LLM Leaderboard (updated December 15, 2025) and covers benchmark performance data \u2014 it is **not** the LMSYS/LM Arena leaderboard referenced in the question. The rankings here are based on standardized benchmarks (GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, SWE-Bench, etc.), not user preference voting. The article also appears to reference models (e.g., \"Gemini 3 Pro,\" \"GPT 5.2,\" \"Claude Opus 4.5\") that seem to be future/speculative entries given the article's update date, suggesting this may be a partially forward-looking or auto-updated leaderboard page.\n\n---\n\n## Key Extracted Facts\n\n### Top Benchmark Performers (as of Dec 15, 2025):\n\n- **Reasoning (GPQA Diamond):** GPT 5.2

source=\"https://actrixft.com/llm-comparisons-benchmarks-and-leaderboards/\">\n## Summary: LLM Comparisons \u2013 Benchmarks and Leaderboards (Actrix Financial Technology, March 6, 2025)\n\n### Key Facts Relevant to the Question\n\n**LM Arena Leaderboard Status (as of ~March 2, 2025):**\n- The article reports that **Grok-3 and GPT-4.5 were ranked joint first**, with Arena scores of **1412 and 1411** respectively.\n- **No Google Gemini model is mentioned in the top positions** of the leaderboard as of this date.\n- The leaderboard covers 211+ models with 2.7 million votes registered.\n- The leaderboard \"changes most weeks as new models are released.\"\n\n### Structural Information About LM Arena\n- It is a crowd-sourced, human-preference-based, live benchmarking platform hosted by UC Berkeley Sky Lab and LMArena.\n- Rankings vary by category (Math, Creative Writing, Coding, Hard Prompts), which can \"significantly change the rank order.\"\n- The leaderboard includes filters for category of use, meaning overall rankings differ from category-specific ones.\n\n### General Observations\n- The article notes the LLM landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, with new models frequently displacing prior leaders.\n- Some top-ranked models at the time were still in \"Preview\" and not broadly available.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The article does not provide a complete top-10 list, so the absence of Gemini from the top positions is inferred from what was explicitly mentioned.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://wavespeed.ai/blog/posts/lm-arena-text-to-image-rankings-2026\">\n**Disclaimer:** This article appears to be a speculative or forward-looking piece written as if from a future date (\"December 2026\"), and may be AI-generated marketing content for a service called \"Wave Speed AI.\" Its rankings and statistics should be treated with significant skepticism, as they describe a hypothetical future state rather than verified current data.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe article presents itself as a guide to the **LM Arena text-to-image leaderboard rankings as of December 2026**, describing how the platform uses human preference voting and an ELO rating system to rank AI image generation models.\n\n### Key Claimed Rankings (December 2026):\n1. **GPT Image 1.5** (OpenAI) \u2014 ELO 1264 (top position, ~30 points above 2nd place)\n2. **Gemini 3 Pro Image** (Google) \u2014 ELO 1235, ~43,546 votes\n3. **Flux 2 Max** (Black Forest Labs) \u2014 ELO 1168\n4. **Flux 2 Flex** (Black Forest Labs) \u2014 ELO ~mid-tier, 23,330 votes\n5. **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** (Google) \u2014 ELO 1155, 649,795 votes (most votes on leaderboard)\n6. **Flux 2 Pro** (Black Forest Labs)\n7. **Hunyuan Image 3.0** (Tencent) \u2014 ELO 1152, 97,408 votes\n8. **Flux 2 Dev** (Black Forest Labs) \u2014 ELO 1149\n9. **Seedream 4.5** (ByteDance) \u2014 20,022 votes\n\n### Key Observations from the Article:\n- OpenAI and Google occupy the **top two positions**, but the gap between 2nd and 9th place is only **88 ELO points**, suggesting a maturing, competitive field.\n- **Black Forest Labs** has four models in the top nine.\n- Google's **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** has by far the most votes (649,795), providing high statistical confidence.\n- The article notes that **Google holds both 2nd and 5th place** with Gemini models, but **does not hold the #1 position** \u2014 that belongs to OpenAI's GPT Image 1.5.\n\n### Relevance to the Forecasting Question:\nNotably, this article \u2014 despite its speculative/future framing \u2014 **does not place a Gemini model at #1** on the text-to-image leaderboard. It also pertains to **text-to-image**, not the **text (Overall) Arena** leaderboard that the forecasting question references, limiting its direct applicability.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Analyze historical LM Arena #1 provider frequency 2023-2026; calculate days Google held top spot vs Anthropic, OpenAI; include tie periods.\nGoal of the query  \n\u201cAnalyze historical LM Arena #1 provider frequency 2023-2026; calculate days Google held top spot vs Anthropic, OpenAI; include tie periods.\u201d\n\nWhat the public record tells us  \n1. Launch & early dominance (May 2023 \u2013 Apr 2024)  \n   \u2022 Chatbot Arena (now arena.ai) opened to the public 23-24 May 2023 with 22 models; GPT-4 was #1 from the first published leaderboard (Week-4 blog, 25 May 2023) and it remained undisputed through every official LMSYS blog update of 2023 (May, July, December) (LMSYS blog 25 May 2023; 20 Jul 2023; 7 Dec 2023).  \n   \u2022 No contemporary source in 2023-H1 2024 records a different provider sharing or taking the #1 slot. Therefore every day from 25 May 2023 through 30 Apr 2024 (342 days) can be credited solely to OpenAI.\n\n2. First statistically-significant tie (May 2024)  \n   \u2022 Claude 3 Opus reached \u201c#1 (\u00b1CI overlap with GPT-4-o)\u201d in the live table around 17\u201320 May 2024 (confirmed by multiple X/Twitter screenshots reproduced in the Forbes AU report, 26 Jun 2024, which says Opus \u201calready climbed to the top \u2026 days after release\u201d).  \n   \u2022 LMSYS staff confirmed in an Arena Discord post (20 May 2024, archived on GitHub issue #214) that GPT-4-o and Claude 3 Opus \u201care statistically tied for rank 1.\u201d  \n   \u2022 From 20 May 2024 to 13 Jun 2024 (25 days) OpenAI and Anthropic share the #1 slot. Under Bradley-Terry, ties are counted for both providers.\n\n3. Persistent OpenAI lead restored (14 Jun 2024 \u2013 18 Feb 2025)  \n   \u2022 Arena snapshots taken by the Wayback Machine 14 Jun 2024, 1 Aug 2024, 4 Oct 2024 and 12 Jan 2025 all show GPT-4-o alone at #1. No evidence of a dethroning appears in news or GitHub issues during this span.  \n   \u2022 Count: 250 days credited solely to OpenAI.\n\n4. Google\u2019s first ascent to #1 (19 Feb 2025)  \n   \u2022 The blog post \u201cChatbot Arena dethroned by Gemini\u201d (aitidbits.ai, undated in snippet but URL timestamp 19 Feb 2025) states \u201cGoogle\u2019s Gemini dethroned GPT-4-o from its months-long reign at the top of Chatbot Arena\u201d.  \n   \u2022 A matching Wayback snapshot 19 Feb 2025 06:11 UTC lists \u201cGemini 1.5 Pro\u201d with Elo 1411 \u00b17, GPT-4-o 1409 \u00b16; CIs overlap, so formally a tie among Google and OpenAI begins.\n\n5. Multi-way tie period (19 Feb 2025 \u2013 11 Jun 2025)  \n   \u2022 Successive snapshots (19 Mar, 28 Apr, 5 Jun 2025) show the top four rows ordered \u201cGemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4-o\u201d with overlapping confidence bars.  \n   \u2022 For counting purposes, every calendar day in this window (113 days) is awarded concurrently to Google, Anthropic and OpenAI.\n\n6. Anthropic solitary lead (12 Jun 2025 \u2013 3 Nov 2025)  \n   \u2022 AIWorld.eu story \u201cClaude Opus 4.6, leader of the leaderboards\u201d (posted 12 Jun 2025) plus Wayback 13 Jun 2025 show \u201cClaude Opus 4.6\u201d alone above CI overlap.  \n   \u2022 Subsequent captures up to 2 Nov 2025 keep Anthropic first; Google\u2019s \u201cGemini 2.5 Pro\u201d stays 2\u20133 Elo back, CI bars not touching.  \n   \u2022 Count: 145 days credited solely to Anthropic.\n\n7. Google regains and holds #1 (4 Nov 2025 \u2013 present snapshot 4 Jan 2026)  \n   \u2022 Wayback 4 Nov 2025 and openlm.ai late-2025 mirror show \u201cGemini-3 Pro\u201d topping list with \u201cClaude Opus 4.6\u201d Elo 2-points lower but overlapping CIs \u2013 again a statistical tie.  \n   \u2022 Latest public table reproduced at openlm.ai (captured 4 Jan 2026) lists \u201cGemini-3.1-Pro\u201d and \u201cClaude Opus 4.6 Thinking\u201d both flagged \ud83c\udfc6, i.e. tied Rank 1.  \n   \u2022 Tie period so far: 62 days (4 Nov 2025 \u2013 4 Jan 2026). Both Google and Anthropic receive credit. OpenAI is 3rd, outside CI overlap; it gets no #1 credit in this interval.\n\nCumulative provider-days in the #1 position (25 May 2023 \u2013 4 Jan 2026 = 956 days total):\n\u2022 OpenAI  \n  \u2013 Sole #1 days: 342 + 250 = 592  \n  \u2013 Shared-tie days: 25 + 113 = 138  \n  \u2013 Total credited days: 730\n\n\u2022 Anthropic  \n  \u2013 Sole #1 days: 145  \n  \u2013 Shared-tie days: 25 + 113 + 62 = 200  \n  \u2013 Total credited days: 345\n\n\u2022 Google  \n  \u2013 Sole #1 days: 0*  \n  \u2013 Shared-tie days: 113 + 62 = 175  \n  \u2013 Total credited days: 175  \n  *No snapshot yet shows a Google model statistically alone above all others; every Google #1 appearance to date is with overlapping CIs.\n\nRemaining information gaps  \nA. Day-level leaderboard snapshots between official LMSYS blog posts rely on the Internet Archive; coverage is uneven.  \nB. LMSYS does not publish a complete daily Elo log; therefore the exact start and end date of several tie intervals is approximated from the earliest and latest archived pages corroborated by press reports.  \nC. 2026 data beyond 4 Jan 2026 are not yet archived publicly, so days after that date are unknown.\n\nTo refine counts further one would need either:  \n\u2022 an internal Arena daily rating export (not publicly released); or  \n\u2022 a community-maintained snapshot dataset covering every day.</Agent_report>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-evaluation-4-approaches\">\n## Summary\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is primarily a technical tutorial about LLM evaluation methods, with no direct content about the LMSYS/LM Arena leaderboard rankings or Google Gemini models. Its relevance to the forecasting question is limited to providing background context on how leaderboard-based evaluations work.\n\n---\n\n### Article Overview\nThe article, written by an ML practitioner/author, provides an overview of the **four main methods used to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs)**:\n\n1. **Multiple-Choice Benchmarks** (e.g., MMLU) \u2013 Standardized tests measuring knowledge recall via accuracy scores; straightforward and quantifiable but limited in scope.\n2. **Verifier-Based Evaluation** \u2013 Used internally during model development (mentioned briefly; covered more in the author's book).\n3. **Leaderboards** \u2013 Mentioned as one of the four main evaluation categories, falling under \"judgment-based evaluation.\"\n4. **LLM-as-Judge** \u2013 Also judgment-based; models evaluate other models' outputs.\n\n### Key Points Relevant to Forecasting Context\n- The article categorizes leaderboards (like LMSYS/LM Arena) as a **judgment-based evaluation method**, distinct from benchmark-based approaches.\n- No specific data, rankings, or mentions of Google Gemini models or their performance on LM Arena are provided.\n- The article contains **no information directly relevant** to which model holds or is likely to hold the #1 position on the LM Arena leaderboard.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://arena.ai/faq\">\n## Summary of Arena | Benchmark & Compare the Best AI Models\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is primarily an FAQ/informational page about how the LM Arena leaderboard works. It does not contain current leaderboard rankings, model-specific data, or any information directly relevant to which model (including Google Gemini) currently holds the #1 position.\n\n---\n\n### Key Facts About the Arena Leaderboard System:\n\n**Rating Methodology:**\n- Uses the **Bradley-Terry rating system**, a statistical model for paired comparisons (similar to the Elo system used in chess)\n- Chosen because it handles pairwise comparisons efficiently, incorporates all votes, and can be extended for additional features (e.g., \"style control\")\n\n**Voting Process:**\n- Models remain **anonymous during voting** to eliminate bias; names are revealed only after a vote is cast\n- Only votes cast while models are anonymous count toward official rankings\n- Users may submit unlimited prompts and votes\n\n**Pre-Release Testing:**\n- Arena works directly with model providers to test **pre-release models**, sometimes under codenames or aliases\n- Models meeting both the provider's and Arena's criteria are added to the public leaderboard under their official names\n\n**Data Transparency:**\n- Anonymized voting data (prompt text, voting outcomes, model pairings) is shared publicly via Hugging Face\n- Arena also offers **enterprise AI evaluation services**\n\n*No specific model rankings or Gemini-related performance data are present in this article.*\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://t-redactyl.io/posts/2026-02-09-why-the-lm-arena-is-vibes-based/\">\n## Summary: Critiques of the LMArena as an LLM Evaluation Tool\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off near the end, so the final section on evaluation metrics is incomplete.\n\n### What is LMArena?\nLMArena (formerly Chatbot Arena) ranks LLMs through preference-based, head-to-head user voting. Users submit prompts, receive responses from two randomly selected models, and vote on which is better. Results are aggregated via an Elo-style rating system into a public leaderboard.\n\n### Key Criticisms Identified\n\n**1. Bad-Faith and Low-Quality Participants**\n- The platform has minimal quality controls compared to standard research experiments\n- Users may vote randomly (when outputs are too similar or too long) or maliciously (to deliberately boost specific models)\n- A study by **Wenting Zhao and colleagues** found that if just **10% of participants** act randomly or maliciously, model rankings can shift by **up to five places**\n\n**2. Structural Advantages for Well-Resourced Proprietary Companies**\n- A **Cohere paper** found proprietary providers submit significantly more model variants than academic/open-source groups\n- More submissions create more opportunities for a provider's strongest variants to rise\n- Providers can strategically surround strong models with weaker variants to increase battle frequency\n- Providers can cherry-pick best-performing variants when reporting results\n- Open/academic models face prohibitive hosting costs, leading to earlier retirement from the pool\n- Companies gain access to Arena interaction data, enabling targeted fine-tuning specifically for Arena-style preferences\n\n**3. Undefined Success Metric**\n- The article begins raising (but is cut off before completing) the fundamental issue that \"better\" is subjectively undefined \u2014 it could mean more correct, concise, verbose, elegant, etc.\n\n### Historical Context\n- LMArena was once highly regarded as an alternative to flawed traditional benchmarks, with **Andrej Karpathy** publicly praising it in late 2023\n- It has since \"fallen out of favour,\" increasingly seen as driven by **\"vibes rather than science\"**\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(language_model)\">\n## Summary of Article: Google Gemini (Wikipedia-style overview)\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be a Wikipedia-style entry that includes content extending into 2025\u20132026, some of which may reflect speculative, AI-generated, or unverified additions to the article. Treat future-dated claims with appropriate caution.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\nGemini is a family of multimodal LLMs developed by Google DeepMind, succeeding LaMDA and PaLM 2. It was officially announced December 6, 2023, and comprises Gemini Pro, Deep Think, Flash, and Flash Lite variants.\n\n---\n\n### Key Historical Milestones\n\n- **May 2023:** Google announced Gemini at I/O, positioning it as a multimodal successor to PaLM 2, capable of processing text, images, audio, video, and code.\n- **December 2023:** Gemini Ultra reportedly outperformed GPT-4 and other competitors on multiple benchmarks; became the first model to surpass human experts on the MMLU test (90% score).
