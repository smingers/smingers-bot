The model names are not explicitly listed (only providers and licenses are visible in the extracted data), which limits full identification of specific model names.\n\n### Key Facts from the Leaderboard\n\n**Top 10 Rankings by Arena Score:**\n| Rank | Provider | Score | Votes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 1 | Anthropic \u00b7 Proprietary | 1503\u00b18 | 6,583 |\n| 2 | Anthropic \u00b7 Proprietary | 1503\u00b17 | 7,454 |\n| 3 | **Google \u00b7 Proprietary** | 1500\u00b19 | 4,052 |\n| 4 | xAI \u00b7 Proprietary | 1495\u00b110 | 3,818 |\n| 5 | **Google \u00b7 Proprietary** | 1486\u00b14 | 38,248 |\n| 6 | OpenAI \u00b7 Proprietary | 1481\u00b110 | 3,605 |\n| 7 | **Google \u00b7 Proprietary** | 1473\u00b15 | 29,334 |\n| 8 | xAI \u00b7 Proprietary | 1473\u00b14 | 37,474 |\n| 9 | Anthropic \u00b7 Proprietary | 1471\u00b14 | 30,541 |\n| 10 | ByteDance \u00b7 Proprietary | 1470\u00b19 | 4,620 |\n\n### Relevant Observations\n\n- **As of February 26, 2026**, the **#1 and #2 positions are held by Anthropic** models (both scoring 1503, within margin of error of each other).\n- **Google holds #3** (score: 1500\u00b19), very close to the top two Anthropic models but not in first place.\n- Google also holds **#5** (1486\u00b14) and **#7** (1473\u00b15) positions.\n- The scores for ranks 1\u20133 are extremely close (1503, 1503, 1500), meaning the gap between Anthropic (#1/#2) and Google (#3) is within or near the margin of error.\n- Google models (labeled \"Google \u00b7 Proprietary\") appear at ranks 3, 5, 7, 13, 22, and others further down. Some Google entries are labeled \"Google \u00b7 Gemma\" (e.g., ranks 110, 136, 167, 187, 194).\n- The specific Gemini model names are **not visible** in the extracted data \u2014 only provider labels are shown.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted leaderboard data does not display individual model names, only provider/license information. It is therefore not possible to confirm from this article alone whether the Google entries are specifically \"Gemini\"-branded models, though Google's top proprietary models on this leaderboard are widely understood to be from the Gemini family.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
