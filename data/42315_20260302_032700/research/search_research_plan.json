  "plan_analysis": "The snapshot supplied shows Google very close to #1 today (Feb 26 2026) but still behind Anthropic. Forecasters now need:  \n\u2022 Base-rate evidence \u2013 how often (and for how long) Google/Gemini or any provider has actually held #1 on LM Arena since the leaderboard was launched; frequency and timing of lead changes.  \n\u2022 Resolution-mechanism details \u2013 exactly how Arena score is calculated, how often it updates, and how model names/providers are displayed (so forecasters know what qualifies as \u201cGemini\u201d and how quickly a new model can appear).  \n\u2022 Key drivers \u2013 whether Google will ship an upgraded Gemini model (e.g., \u201cUltra 2\u201d) or big tuning push before 15 Mar; likewise whether Anthropic/OpenAI/xAI will counter with their own upgrades.  \n\u2022 Current state \u2013 the very latest leaderboard snapshot (has Google already edged ahead?); any fresh news/rumours of imminent Gemini releases; any reports of Anthropic improvements.  \n\u2022 Contrarian check \u2013 reasons Google might *not* overtake (e.g., evidence of upcoming Anthropic Claude upgrade, voting-pattern quirks, or slower Arena score convergence).\n\nThe eight queries below collectively cover those dimensions. Five are historical (base rate, mechanism, release timelines) and three are current (brand-new launches, present leaderboard standings, competitor moves). Exactly one Agent query is used for the quantitative base-rate analysis.",
