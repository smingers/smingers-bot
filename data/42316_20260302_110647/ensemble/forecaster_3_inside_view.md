## (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; facts vs opinions)

**Just Jared (Feb 23, 2026) – “odds update after BAFTAs” (multiple scraped fragments; incomplete)**  
- **Facts captured:** Essentially none on Best Picture; only that Polymarket odds exist and BAFTAs “shook up the race.”  
- **Quality:** Low for our purposes due to **missing key data** (the actual odds / leader not captured). Treat as **noise**.

**The Guardian (Feb 22, 2026) – BAFTA winners list**  
- **Facts:** *One Battle After Another* won **BAFTA Best Film** and **Best Director** (PTA), plus screenplay/supporting actor. *Sinners* won some tech/supporting prizes; *Frankenstein* won design/costume.  
- **Quality:** High reliability for the BAFTA results. Strong precursor evidence.

**Hollywood Reporter (Feb 27, 2026) – PGA nominees / preview**  
- **Facts:** Lists **PGA theatrical nominees** (includes Bugonia, Frankenstein, Sinners, One Battle After Another, etc.) and notes historical correspondence between PGA and Oscar BP.  
- **Quality:** High for nominee list and context. (Doesn’t contain the PGA winner; that came later.)

**GoldDerby (Mar 1, 2026) – PGA winners list**  
- **Facts:** *One Battle After Another* won the **PGA (Zanuck) Award**. Notes preferential ballot overlap and recent predictive strength.  
- **Quality:** High (industry-tracking outlet; straightforward reporting). Very relevant.

**Franceinfo (Mar 1, 2026) – PGA win writeup (French)**  
- **Facts:** Also reports *One Battle After Another* won PGA; cites “18 of last 20” stat (the exact fraction varies by framing/time window).  
- **Quality:** Good corroboration of the key fact (PGA win). The exact hit-rate statistic is less important than the win itself.

**Forbes (Mar 2, 2026) – Actor Awards/SAG breakdown**  
- **Facts:** Reports *Sinners* won **Best Ensemble** and Michael B. Jordan won **Best Actor** at SAG/“Actor Awards.” Notes *One Battle After Another* won **Supporting Actor** (Sean Penn).  
- **Quality:** Medium-high. Forbes awards analysis is generally credible; still partly interpretive in how it “reshapes” the race.

**Collider (Mar 1, 2026) – streaming item; mentions race is close**  
- **Facts:** Mostly unrelated; contains an assertion the race is close between *Sinners* and *One Battle After Another*.  
- **Quality:** Low-moderate; mostly commentary, not a precursor-results source.

**Movieweb (Feb 23, 2026) – “race wide open” reaction piece**  
- **Facts:** Confirms BAFTA BP/Director for *One Battle After Another*; other details and “wide open” framing are interpretive.  
- **Quality:** Medium; useful only insofar as it’s consistent on BAFTA outcomes.

**Mirror Media (Feb 18, 2026; zh) – discusses “Value of Emotion” (= Sentimental Value)**  
- **Facts/claims:** Mentions a possible third contender benefiting from a split.  
- **Quality:** Low for direct forecasting here; also outside our listed options. Minimal weight.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

### Strong evidence (big shifts)
1) **PGA win: *One Battle After Another*** (GoldDerby + Franceinfo; corroborated)  
- Mechanism: PGA uses a **preferential ballot** similar to the Academy’s BP vote; historically one of the **best single predictors**.  
- Mapping to our options: *One Battle After Another* is **not listed**, so it implies **“Other”**.

2) **BAFTA Best Film + Director: *One Battle After Another*** (Guardian; high reliability)  
- Mechanism: BAFTA overlaps with industry taste and often signals broad support, especially when paired with PGA.

### Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
3) **SAG/Actor Awards Ensemble: *Sinners*** (Forbes)  
- Mechanism: Actors are the **largest Academy branch**; Ensemble can proxy for broad, passion-driven support.  
- This is the **main counter-signal** to the PGA/BAFTA direction.

4) **Nomination strength / visibility: *Sinners* leads with 16 nominations** (reported across sources)  
- Mechanism: wide nomination footprint can indicate cross-branch support (though it can also reflect “many #2s/#3s” rather than #1s).

5) **Within-SAG split signals**: *One Battle After Another* still won **Supporting Actor** (Sean Penn) (Forbes)  
- Mechanism: mitigates the “actors abandoned it” story; suggests actors aren’t monolithic for *Sinners*.

### Weak evidence (small tweaks)
6) Betting-odds talk without data (Just Jared incomplete)  
7) “Race is close / wide open” pundit framing (Collider, Movieweb) without new quantified information.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** Mar 2, 2026. **Oscars:** Mar 15, 2026 → ~**13 days** remaining.  
- If timeframe were **halved (~6–7 days)**: I’d expect **little movement** unless a major scandal/late-breaking narrative emerges; most precursor info is already in.  
- If timeframe were **doubled (~26 days)** (i.e., we were earlier, pre-SAG/PGA): I’d expect **more volatility**; the SAG and PGA outcomes are precisely the kind of late precursors that compress uncertainty.

## (d) Justification: how this updates the outside view
**Outside-view base rates (given):** Bugonia 2 / Frankenstein 3 / Sinners 10 / Other 85.

**Status quo if nothing changed:** With **PGA + BAFTA** (and widely-reported broader guild momentum in the background material), the default is that *One Battle After Another* wins Best Picture → **“Other”**.

**Why adjust away from 85% “Other” at all?**  
Because we have a **credible, late, high-signal counter-precursor**: **SAG Ensemble for *Sinners***, plus a headline acting win (Jordan). Ensemble wins can indicate the kind of broad, emotionally engaged support that does well on preferential ballots—especially if the PGA/BAFTA leader is admired but could be ranked lower by a meaningful minority.

**Why not adjust more dramatically (e.g., make Sinners favorite)?**  
Because:  
- **PGA remains the single most structurally analogous precursor** (same ballot style; producers overlap with industry consensus).  
- BAFTA Best Film/Director support reinforces “overall winner” status for *One Battle After Another*.  
- *One Battle After Another* still shows **actor-branch traction** (Supporting Actor win), reducing the probability that SAG Ensemble reflects an overwhelming Academy actor bloc alignment.

Net: I reduce “Other” meaningfully but still keep it clearly ahead; I allocate most upset probability to **Sinners**, with **Frankenstein/Bugonia** remaining longshots absent a major late-breaking shift.

Probability calibration
- Start from outside view: **[2, 3, 10, 85]**
- Update for **SAG Ensemble + Best Actor** for *Sinners* (moderate-to-strong late signal): shift ~**+10 to +15** points toward Sinners, mostly taken from Other.
- Keep small residual probabilities for Bugonia/Frankenstein as “tail risk” (unexpected preferential-ballot consensus, late surge, or misread of the true top-two).

**Inside-view distribution:**  
- Bugonia: 1  
- Frankenstein: 2  
- Sinners: 22  
- Other: 75  

(Interpreting “Other” as most likely *One Battle After Another* given the precursor record.)

Checklist:
1) **Criteria/options:** Must match official Oscars 2026 page Best Picture winner; choose Bugonia/Frankenstein/Sinners/Other.  
2) **Outside view base rate:** [2, 3, 10, 85]. Final stays anchored but updated for SAG.  
3) **Consistency:** Most likely = Other; least likely = Bugonia; yes, consistent with precursor dominance + minimal signals for Bugonia.  
4) **Top evidence (3–5, <20 words each):**  
   - PGA winner: *One Battle After Another* (implies “Other”).  
   - BAFTA Best Film/Director: *One Battle After Another*.  
   - SAG Ensemble: *Sinners* (major late counter-signal).  
   - *Sinners* leads nominations (16), indicating broad Academy support.  
5) **Blind spot scenario:** A strong “actors + passion” coalition flips preferential ballot to *Sinners* despite PGA/BAFTA.  
6) **Status quo:** Precursor sweep leader remains *One Battle After Another* → “Other” still favored.  
7) **Technicalities:** Probabilities are 0–100, sum to 100, no percent signs.

Probabilities: [1, 2, 22, 75]
