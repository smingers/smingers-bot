Paraphrase (<30 words)  
Winner of the 98th Oscars Best Picture on 15 Mar 2026. Options: Bugonia, Frankenstein, Sinners, any other film (“Other”). Resolution uses the Academy’s official winners page.

Outside-view base (explained below)  
Bugonia 2 | Frankenstein 5 | Sinners 9 | Other 84  (sum = 100)

Consistency check  
Most likely = Other; least likely = Bugonia.  Aligns with PGA history and current precursor landscape.

Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
1. PGA top prize to One Battle After Another (OBAA) – 18/20 correlation with Oscar.  
2. OBAA also won BAFTA & Golden Globe – rare multi-precursor sweep.  
3. SAG/“Actor Awards” Ensemble win for Sinners – actors are largest Academy branch; precedent: Parasite, CODA, Spotlight.  
4. No major precursor wins for Frankenstein or Bugonia; minimal guild momentum.  
5. Only 13 days remain; ballots closed 5 Mar, limiting late swings.

Blind-spot  
A sudden anti-OBAA backlash (e.g., plagiarism scandal) emerging after ballots but before ceremony could nullify precursor value.

Status-quo tilt  
Academy usually mirrors PGA when nothing dramatic shifts; retain bias toward that outcome (“Other”).

Detailed Analysis

(a) Source analysis (quality & fact/opinion)  
1. GoldDerby 1 Mar 26 – lists PGA winners; trade site, reliable factual data; opinionated forecasting labelled clearly.  
2. FranceInfo 1 Mar 26 – reports PGA win for OBAA; mainstream outlet, factual.  
3. Guardian 22 Feb 26 – BAFTA winners; high reliability.  
4. Forbes 2 Mar 26 – SAG recap; sound factual recap, some opinion.  
5. JustJared betting-odds piece 23 Feb 26 – entertainment blog; odds fragment only (weak).  
6. VanityFair Oct 25 – pre-nomination prediction; dated but illuminates perceived hierarchy.  
7. ScreenRant 4 Dec 25 – early-season sweep article; opinion but precursor facts correct.  
8. Misc. AFP/Collider etc. – colour but no contradictory data.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: PGA/OBAA win (multiple independent outlets + robust historical signal); BAFTA & Globe alignment; SAG Ensemble for Sinners; historical preferential-ballot precedents (Crash, Spotlight, Parasite, CODA).  
Moderate: Betting-market chatter (incomplete); critics awards.  
Weak: Anecdotes about box-office, presenter line-ups.

(c) Timeframe  
13 days to ceremony; ballots locked 5 Mar.  If timeframe halved (≈6 days), probability spread would narrow further toward status quo.  If doubled (≈4 weeks), more scope for backlash stories → slightly higher upset chances (+3–4 pts to non-Other).

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment  
Start with base-rate: PGA winner matches Oscar 77 % (last 22 yrs).  
Add 5 % to base upset chance because SAG backed an alternative with record 16 noms (Sinners) and recent preferential-ballot history shows four PGA misses in 12 years, three triggered by SAG Ensemble winners.  
Allocate 60 % of upset space to Sinners (strong challenger), 30 % to Frankenstein (some craft wins & nominations), 10 % to Bugonia (minimal buzz).  
Math:  
– Base success for OBAA (Other) 77 %  
– Residual 23 % upset space: Sinners ≈ 14 %, Frankenstein ≈ 7 %, Bugonia ≈ 2 %  
Round conservatively and nudge 1 pt back to Other for status-quo bias.
