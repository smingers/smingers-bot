**Evaluating award probabilities**

I'm working on an inside-view forecast and need to finalize my probabilities. The important components include analyzing new information about SAG winners announced today. Sinners won Ensemble, which improves its chance from a baseline of 9 to maybe 14 or 15. Historically, SAG wins have upset PGA favorites, suggesting a 25% chance for this scenario. Meanwhile, I'll adjust the outside view baseline for Other from 84% down to 78%. My final probabilities might look like this: [2, 5, 14, 78].**Adjusting probabilities for films**

I’m increasing Sinners to 15 and keeping Frankenstein at 5, while Bugonia stays at 2. I need to consider whether Frankenstein or Bugonia have a shot. Frankenstein has nominations but lacks significant wins, so its likelihood is low. For probabilities, I’m using an inside view: building a base of 80 for PGA correlation and stating a 20% chance of upsets.

For the upsets, I suggest: 60% goes to Sinners, 25% to Frankenstein, 5% to Bugonia, and 10% to other alternatives. I calculate the final probabilities as follows: Sinners at 12, Frankenstein at 5, Bugonia at 1, and Other at 82. Considering the SAG effects, I might increase the alternative probability to 25%, leading to a distribution adjustment. After all calculations, the final scene looks like this: [2, 6, 15, 77]. Now, I’ll compile the analysis and follow the checklist!
