Analysis
-------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (chronological & quality)

1. Guardian (22 Feb 26, BAFTA winners) – high-credibility newspaper, gives hard facts: BAFTA Best Film = One Battle After Another (OBAA).  Factual, strong.

2. GoldDerby + Hollywood Reporter / FranceInfo (1 Mar 26, PGA results) – industry trades, accurate guild-award reporting.  Both confirm OBAA won PGA.  Factual, strong.

3. Forbes (2 Mar 26, Actor Awards recap) – business publication; quotes SAG/Actor Awards.  Confirms Sinners won Ensemble & Best Actor.  Factual, strong.

4. Movieweb (23 Feb 26) – entertainment site; recaps BAFTA impact.  Mostly accurate facts but some opinion.  Useful for confirming Sinners/OBAA rivalry.

5. Just Jared (23 Feb 26) – pop blog, betting-odds headline but missing data → little value.

6. Vanity Fair / ScreenRant / The Ringer (late ’25) – preseason punditry; dated but show early critical consensus around OBAA.  Opinion, moderate.

7. AskNews collateral AFP, Collider, Bored Panda, etc. – mostly side stories; only repeat nomination counts (Sinners 16, OBAA 13, etc.).  Low-medium relevance.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong evidence  
• OBAA wins PGA (historically 18/23 = 78 % correlation with Oscar BP) – two independent trade sources.  
• OBAA wins BAFTA Best Film & DGA – triple crown of influential guilds.  
• Sinners wins SAG/Actor Ensemble – actors are the Academy’s largest branch; SAG ensemble winner matched Oscar BP 4/15 times (Parasite, Spotlight, Argo, CODA).

Moderate evidence  
• Record 16 nominations for Sinners (high nomination count correlated with broad support but not decisive).  
• Genre bias: vampire musical-horror rarely wins BP (negative for Sinners).  
• Frankenstein strong craft love but no major guild wins.

Weak evidence  
• Incomplete betting-odds snippets (Just Jared).  
• Anecdotal box-office / social-media chatter.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Outcome known in 13 days (ceremony 15 Mar 26).  Voting closed 5 Mar.  No further guild data possible; only media narrative can shift perceptions.  If the window were halved to 6 days (i.e., after ballots closed) I would raise confidence in the current leader by ~3 pts.  If doubled to 26 days I would lower confidence ~4 pts to allow for late-breaking backlash.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Start from outside-view (5 Bugonia | 12 Frankenstein | 25 Sinners | 58 Other).

Apply strong PGA + DGA + BAFTA convergence for OBAA (inside “Other”): +17 pts to Other.  
Counter it with SAG Ensemble for Sinners (+- nothing for Other, +5 pts to Sinners).  
Genre risk & lack of PGA for Sinners (-10 pts to Sinners).  
Frankenstein unchanged except small craft respect (-6 pts → +? actually slight drop).  
Bugonia’s weak nomination profile (-3 pts).  

Normalise to 100 %.

Resulting probabilities  
Bugonia 2 % – very low nominations, zero precursor traction.  
Frankenstein 6 % – nine nominations, some tech guild wins, but absent from major precursors.  
Sinners 19 % – SAG passion + record noms give a real but minority chance.  
Other 73 % – driven almost entirely by OBAA, the triple-crown guild winner.

Probability calibration
I interpret 73 % as fair-odds 1.37:1 in favour of “Other”.  A ±10 % swing in “Other” would mainly come out of Sinners, reflecting their two-horse structure.

----------------- Checklist -----------------
1. Options recap: whichever film wins 98th-Oscars Best Picture on 15 Mar 26.  Options: Bugonia, Frankenstein, Sinners, or any other film.

2. Outside view was 5/12/25/58.

3. Consistency: Most likely = Other; Least likely = Bugonia – matches reasoning & data.

4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
• OBAA wins PGA (78 % historical match).  
• OBAA wins DGA.  
• OBAA wins BAFTA Best Film.  
• Sinners wins SAG Ensemble.  
• Sinners record 16 nominations.

5. Blind-spot: Academy backlash to perceived frontrunner (OBAA) leading many voters to rank it low, letting Sinners accrue 1st-/2nd-place votes.

6. Status-quo: Guild sweep normally holds; lean further toward Other by small margin.

7. Technicalities: Numbers 0-100, sum 100, list order correct.

Probabilities: [2, 6, 19, 73]
