Analysis:
The forecaster’s goal is to estimate which nominee—Bugonia, Frankenstein, Sinners, or “Other”—will be announced as Best Picture at the 98th Oscars in roughly two weeks.  
Already known: nothing beyond the question text.  
Needed evidence:

1. Base rate / historical precedents  
   • How reliably do precursor awards (PGA, DGA, BAFTA, Golden Globes, SAG Ensemble) predict Best Picture?  
   • How often do upsets occur and under what conditions (e.g., preferential ballot quirks, vote-splits)?  
   • Historical accuracy of betting markets.

2. Resolution mechanism  
   • Confirmation that oscars.org will publish the winner; mechanics are straightforward but a quick primer on preferential ballot voting can clarify drivers of surprise outcomes.

3. Key drivers for 2026 race  
   • Results of this season’s precursor awards.  
   • Current betting odds / prediction markets.  
   • Industry commentary on campaign strength, controversies, or shifts in sentiment.

4. Current state  
   • Which film has already won the major precursors (PGA, BAFTA, etc.) and critics’ awards.  
   • Latest odds and pundit forecasts less than two weeks from ceremony.

5. Contrarian check  
   • Articles or commentary highlighting scenarios where the perceived front-runner could lose or where a vote-split boosts an underdog, informed by past upsets.

The eight queries below are designed to collect that evidence: five historical (base-rate, mechanism, upset frequency) and three current (recent precursor results, odds, expert commentary).
