In Best Actress, Jessie Buckley won the Actor Award for her role as Agnes Shakespeare in 'Hamnet', completing a historic clean sweep of the Critics' Choice, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Actor Awards; she is the first actress since Cate Blanchett in 2013 to achieve this, making her a near-guaranteed winner at the 98th Academy Awards on March 15. In a major upset for Best Actor, Michael B. Jordan won the Actor Award for his dual role as twins Smoke and Stack (plus a vampiric transformation) in 'Sinners', which grossed $369 million worldwide and received a record 16 Oscar nominations; this win disrupts Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's momentum, who had won the Critics' Choice and Golden Globe (Musical/Comedy) for 'Marty Supreme' but lost the BAFTA to Robert Aramayo for 'I Swear'. For Best Supporting Actress, the race remains fractured with Amy Madigan winning the Actor Award for 'Weapons', while Teyana Taylor won the Golden Globe for 'One Battle After Another' and Wunmi Mosaku won the BAFTA for 'Sinners'; Madigan faces the historical hurdle that 'Weapons' received no other Oscar nominations, unlike 'One Battle After Another' which is a Best Picture frontrunner. In a stunning turn, 'Sinners' won the Best Ensemble award, beating out 'One Battle After Another' (which had won the Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Producers Guild Awards), potentially opening the door for a Picture-Director split at the Oscars. Meanwhile, Sean Penn won Best Supporting Actor for 'One Battle After Another', extending SAG's streak of matching the Oscar winner in this category to nine consecutive years. The ceremony, attended by presenters like Viola Davis, emphasized honoring actors in film and television, with the name change announced in November 2025 to clarify the show's focus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 04:22 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hannahabraham/2026/03/01/what-the-actor-awards-2026-tell-us-about-the-oscar-race-a-category-by-category-breakdown/)\n\n**HBO Max Snags Steve Carell's 10/10 Oscar-Winning Masterpiece**\nHBO Max is adding the 2006 Oscar-winning film 'Little Miss Sunshine' to its library in March 2026, coinciding with the 98th Academy Awards set for March 15 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the film stars Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Abigail Breslin, Greg Kinnear, and Alan Arkin, and is described as a 'genius Oscar winner' and one of the 'best tragicomedies of the century so far.' While the film won Oscars for Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay, it lost the Best Picture prize to 'The Departed.' The film holds a 91% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics praising its 'strong ensemble cast' and 'delightfully funny script.' Additionally, HBO Max is launching in the UK and Ireland on March 26, 2026, where it will feature the film and future content including a 'Harry Potter' reimagining confirmed for an early 2027 debut. The article notes that the 2026 Best Picture race is expected to be a close contest between Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' and Paul Thomas Anderson's 'One Battle After Another.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 08:40 PM\nSource:[Collider](https://collider.com/steve-carell-little-miss-sunshine-oscar-winning-masterpiece-streaming-hbo-max-march-2026/)\n\n**Paul Thomas Anderson's 'A Brawl After Another' Wins PGA Award, Eyes Oscars**\nOn Saturday, February 28, 'A Brawl After Another' (Une bataille apr\u00e8s l'autre) was named the best film of the year by the Producers Guild Awards (PGA), a prestigious accolade that cements its status as a favorite for the Oscars. The Producers Guild of America, a union with over 8,000 members, awards the PGA annually, and the winner has won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 18 out of the last 20 years, according to the article. Paul Thomas Anderson's tragicomedy, adapted from Thomas Pynchon's novel 'Vineland', stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Teyana Taylor, and Benicio Del Toro, and depicts a fractured America torn by the legacies of the Ku Klux Klan and Black Power. Anderson accepted the award, stating, 'C'est un immense honneur, merci beaucoup' ('It is a great honor, thank you very much'), and addressed the leadership of Warner Bros, the studio distributing the film, saying, 'Puissiez-vous brandir longtemps votre \u00e9tendard, quoi que l'avenir vous r\u00e9serve. C'est une bataille apr\u00e8s l'autre' ('May you long bear your banner, whatever the future holds. It is a battle after another'). The film has received 13 Oscar nominations, including one for all its main actors. Its main competitor, 'Sinners' by Ryan Coogler, holds a record 16 nominations; while 'Sinners' explores the deep wounds of Black people in 1930s segregated America against a backdrop of vampire tales and blues rhythms, the article suggests 'A Brawl After Another' may be disadvantaged in the race for Best Picture despite its accolades.

Zanuck Award for Outstanding Producer of Theatrical Motion Pictures. According to GoldDerby, this award is a strong indicator for the Academy Awards, having correctly predicted the previous five Best Picture winners through a preferential ballot from a field of 10 films. The win solidifies Paul Thomas Anderson's film as a frontrunner for the Oscars, which are scheduled for March 15. 'KPop Demon Hunters' also won Best Animated Feature, continuing its streak of prizes and leading its race at the Academy Awards, per Gold Derby prediction data. A notable disconnect occurred in the Best Documentary race, where the PGA honored 'My Mom Jayne: A Film by Mariska Hargitay', a film that was not nominated at the Academy Awards. In the television categories, the PGA largely matched recent Emmy and Golden Globe winners, awarding 'The Studio' for Best Comedy Series, 'Adolescence' for Best Limited/Anthology Series, and 'The Pitt' for Best Drama Series.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 06:20 AM\nSource:[GoldDerby](https://www.goldderby.com/film/2026/2026-producers-guild-awards-winners-list-one-battle-after-another/)\n\n**2026 PGA Awards: Key Indicator for Best Picture Race Between 'One Battle After Another' and 'Sinners'**\nOn March 1, 2026, at the 2026 Producers Guild of America (PGA) Awards, the Darryl F.

DiCaprio's film, 'One Battle After Another', is an adaptation of Peter Cameron's novel depicting a US couple traveling to a snowy European town to adopt a child; it marks the latest collaboration between Martin Scorsese and DiCaprio following their 2023 film 'Killers of the Flower Moon'. Although DiCaprio left the BAFTA awards last week empty-handed\u2014where Robert Aramayo won for 'I Swear'\u2014'One Battle After Another' was named Best Film at the BAFTAs.

Skarsg\u00e5rd stated, 'It grows because of the word of mouth of people who see it and like it,' emphasizing that the film 'has had a long life in movie theaters.' The film, directed by Joachim Trier and co-starring nominee Renate Reinsve, is competing in nine Academy Award categories. Skarsg\u00e5rd, who has over 150 credits in nearly six decades of career and has won a Golden Globe for the role, compared the ideal film distribution to the 'slow food' movement, arguing that 'movie theaters die if we only have streaming.' He expressed optimism about the industry's future, citing the globalization of cinema and the recent trend of non-English films, specifically 'Love & Sentiment' and the Brazilian 'The Secret Agent,' breaking into the Best Picture category, traditionally dominated by US productions. Skarsg\u00e5rd, who discussed the event at the Academy's annual luncheon in Beverly Hills on February 10, 2026, called for films to return to their 'natural habitat' of theaters.

Yates Whittle, a sound engineer with credits on 'Titanic' and 'Avatar: The Way of Water', stated to AFP that maintaining the energy of a real race was key, noting, 'It was important to keep the energy of a real Formula 1 race alive.' The team, nominated for Best Sound alongside John, Juan Peralta, Al Nelson, and Gary A. Rizzo, aimed to recreate the feeling of being inside a Formula 1 car for those who had never experienced it. To achieve this, they captured and studied audio from actual circuits, mixing intense engine roars, tire friction, brake squeals, radio dialogue, and digital tones. Gareth John, who previously won an Oscar for 'Dune: Part Two', described the reception as 'fantastic' and noted the film benefited from the advisory of seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton. The film, starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris and directed by Joseph Kosinski ('Top Gun: Maverick'), was a success for Apple TV and secured a nomination for Best Picture, where it will compete against 'Oppenheimer' and 'Poor Things', among others. The team recently won a Bafta and will compete for the Academy Award against the sound teams of 'Frankenstein', 'Sinners', 'The Brutalist', and the Spanish film 'Sirat'.

'One Battle After Another' remains the frontrunner for Best Picture and Best Director (Paul Thomas Anderson) after winning both BAFTAs. However, the Best Actor race was upended when Robert Armaryo won for 'I Swear,' defeating favorites Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (Marty Supreme) and Leonardo DiCaprio. Armaryo\u2019s film is not eligible for the Oscars until the 99th Academy Awards, meaning Chalamet could still win despite the upset. Chalamet, who previously won the Critics' Choice Award and Golden Globe, is aiming for a back-to-back win after taking Best Actor for 'A Complete Unknown' in 2025. 'Marty Supreme' tied the record for most losses in a single BAFTA night with 11 nominations and zero wins, matching 'Women in Love' (1969) and 'Finding Neverland' (2004). In Best Supporting Actor, Sean Penn won for 'One Battle After Another,' breaking a trend where Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd (Golden Globe) and Jacob Elordi (Critics' Choice) had won earlier awards. If Benicio del Toro wins at a major ceremony, four of the five nominees will have won a major award. Meanwhile, Benicio del Toro\u2019s nomination for 'One Battle After Another' and Delroy Lindo\u2019s surprise nomination for 'Sinners'\u2014which earned 16 nominations\u2014could lead to a surprise win for Lindo. In Best Supporting Actress, Wunmi Mosaku won for 'Sinners,' defeating Golden Globe winner Teyana Taylor and Critics' Choice winner Amy Madigan. The Best Picture race is now a tight contest between 'One Battle After Another' and 'Sinners,' both from Warner Bros. The 98th Academy Awards will be held on March 15, 2026, and the race remains highly unpredictable, with films like 'F1' receiving unexpected Best Picture nominations while acclaimed films such as 'Wicked: For Good,' 'It Was Just an Accident,' 'No Other Choice,' and 'Sorry, Baby' were shut out. The voting bodies of different award shows differ significantly, making predictions unreliable\u2014e.g., 'Conclave' won BAFTA Best Picture in 2025 but lost to 'Anora' at the Oscars. Jessie Buckley is seen as the likely Best Actress winner for 'Hamnet,' following her Golden Globe and Critics' Choice wins, along with a BAFTA.

The film with the most nominations is 'The Guilty,' which received 16 nominations, followed closely by 'War and Peace' with 13 nominations. Both are considered front-runners for the Best Picture award. However, 'The Value of Emotion,' representing Norway and previously known as an international feature film, is also a strong contender. It has earned nine nominations, including Best Director, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor, and is a Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize winner. This success positions it as a potential beneficiary if the competition between the two leading films intensifies, possibly allowing it to capitalize on their rivalry.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 01:59 AM\nSource:[\u93e1\u9031\u520a Mirror Media](https://www.mirrormedia.mg/story/20260202edi066)\n\n**Ranking The Best Picture Nominees At The 98th Academy Awards From Worst To Best**\nOn January 22, 2026, the 98th Academy Awards nominations were announced, featuring 10 films in the Best Picture category.

The piece analyzes contenders based on recent awards momentum, including the Golden Globe nominations and early circuit prizes. Key films highlighted include 'Wicked: For Good', 'The Brutalist', 'Emilia P\u00e9rez', 'Sinners', 'Hamnet', 'Avatar: Fire and Ash', and 'Blue Moon'. 'Wicked: For Good' is discussed as a potential underdog with strong audience appeal but uncertain Oscar viability, while 'Hamnet' is framed as a quintessential Oscar bait film, designed to provoke critical acclaim and awards attention. Other films like 'Frankenstein', 'The Running Man', 'Train Dreams', and 'The Adam Sandler Hall of Fame' are categorized by their nomination likelihood and cultural positioning. The article also includes a 'Stock Watch' section evaluating the momentum of films and their prospects, with 'The Testament of Ann Lee' and 'Amanda Seyfried' noted as 'Stock up' and 'Cynthia Erivo' and 'Marty Supreme' as 'Stock down'. The analysis reflects on themes such as profitability, sentimentality, and the challenges of winning Best Picture despite box office failure or niche appeal.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 08:51 AM\nSource:[theringer.com](https://www.theringer.com/2025/12/11/oscars/oscars-best-picture-nominees-contenders-favorites-predictions)\n\n**The Oscars 2026 Best Picture Race Is Already Over**\nThe 2026 Oscars Best Picture race is considered effectively decided, according to ScreenRant, despite the ceremony still being over three months away. Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 'One Battle After Another' has secured its position as the clear frontrunner after winning Best Feature at the Gotham Awards, Best Film from the New York Film Critics Circle (NYFCC), and Best Film from the National Board of Review (NBR) within a three-day span. These three awards are historically significant in predicting Best Picture winners: the Gotham has matched the Oscar winner six times out of 21, the NYFCC has aligned with the Academy 32 times since 1935 (with three matches since 2004), and the NBR has matched the Oscar winner 22 times out of 93. Notably, this is the first time in history that a film has won all three awards in the same year, creating unprecedented momentum. The article notes that the convergence of these three distinct award groups\u2014each with different voting bases and focuses\u2014makes this achievement exceptionally rare, as they have historically named different winners 14 of 21 years. With no other contender such as Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s 'Hamnet', Ryan Coogler\u2019s 'Sinners', Joachim Trier\u2019s 'Sentimental Value', Josh Safdie\u2019s 'Marty Supreme', or Guillermo del Toro\u2019s 'Frankenstein' able to mount a credible challenge, 'One Battle After Another' is described as having 'locked up' its Best Picture win. The article concludes that if the film does not win Best Picture at the 98th Academy Awards, it would be one of the biggest upsets in the Oscars\u2019 98-year history.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/oscars-2026-best-picture-race-over/)\n\n**As Oscar Season Approaches: Who Will Win Best Picture and Best Actor?**\nAs the 98th Academy Awards approach, speculation is intensifying over which films and actors are likely to be nominated for the world's most prestigious film awards, three months before the ceremony. This year's Hollywood landscape appears more diverse and exciting than in previous years, with standout films featuring deep humanistic themes and bold artistic and directorial achievements. Key films anticipated in the race include 'One Battle After Another,' which is leading in expectations as a top contender; 'Sentimental Value,' which has not yet been released but has already drawn strong critical attention and festival buzz due to its impactful concept and strong cast; 'Marty Supreme,' an upcoming film expected to compete strongly for awards in direction, acting, and cinematography; and 'Hamnet,' also considered a strong contender. Industry observers note that release timing, critical reception, and the scale of promotional campaigns are crucial factors in securing a spot on the final nomination list. There is also a strong expectation for a prominent presence of socially and humanely themed films, aligning with the Academy\u2019s recent trend of honoring works that combine artistic excellence with meaningful messages. Additionally, surprises from small independent films remain possible, as seen in past years when under-the-radar films defied expectations and achieved major success. Among the leading actor contenders are Leonardo DiCaprio for 'One Battle After Another,' Wagner Moura for his role in the Brazilian film 'The Secret Agent,' where he won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival this year, Michael B. Jordan for his dual role in 'Sinners,' Timothy Chalamet for his performance in 'Marty Supreme,' and Jeremy Allen White for his portrayal of Bruce Springsteen in 'Deliver Me from Nowhere,' which generated widespread media and audience attention. Other potential nominees include Dwayne Johnson for 'The Smashing Machine,' Ethan Hawke for 'Blue Moon,' and Jesse Plemons for 'Bugonia,' directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 06:00 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6743665)\n\n**Statue Season: A Way-Too-Early Preview of the 98th Oscars\u2019 Best Picture Race**\nThe article 'Statue Season: A Way-Too-Early Preview of the 98th Oscars\u2019 Best Picture Race' provides an early analysis of potential contenders for the 2026 Academy Awards, with 'One Battle After Another' emerging as a front-runner, currently listed at -175 odds on DraftKings.

The film has accumulated wins at the **Producers Guild Awards (PGA)**, **Directors Guild Awards (DGA)**, **Golden Globes**, **Critics Choice**, **ACE**, **ASC**, **BSC**, and **BAFTAs** [2][3]. Historically, the PGA has matched the Best Picture Oscar winner in 17 of the last 22 years, and the PGA has decided the winner in four out of the last five years specifically [2][3].\n\n## The Challenger: \"Sinners\"\n\nHowever, **\"Sinners\"** staged a significant upset at the March 2, 2026 Screen Actors Guild Awards (now rebranded as the \"Actor Awards\"), winning both **Best Ensemble** and **Best Actor for Michael B. Jordan** [1][2][3]. This victory is particularly consequential because actors constitute the largest branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and SAG winners often signal Oscar success [3][5].\n\nIf \"Sinners\" prevails, it would become the **first predominantly Black film to win Best Picture since \"Moonlight\" (2017)** and only the third from a Black director overall, following Barry Jenkins and Steve McQueen [3]. The film also holds a **record 16 Oscar nominations** this year [2].\n\n## Historical Precedent: The \"Parasite\" Path\n\nIndustry experts are closely studying the **2020 precedent**, when SAG selected \"Parasite\" while PGA and DGA chose \"1917\"\u2014with \"Parasite\" ultimately winning Best Picture [3]. This scenario suggests that a SAG Ensemble win can overcome the PGA/DGA double, particularly when a film has broad Academy support across departments. \"Sinners\" fits this profile with its record nomination count and strong emotional resonance with performers [1][3].\n\n## The Case for \"One Battle After Another\"\n\nCritics of the \"Sinners\" momentum theory note that \"One Battle After Another\" has broader industry support beyond just the directing and producing branches. The film also claimed the **SAG Supporting Actor win for Sean Penn**, suggesting it isn't entirely disconnected from the actors' branch [1][3]. Additionally, the Academy's international membership (20% based outside the U.S.) may differ from SAG-AFTRA's overwhelmingly U.S.-based 160,000 members, potentially favoring Anderson's film [1].\n\n## Expert Forecasts\n\nAccording to GoldDerby's expert prognosticators, **Jessie Buckley** (\"Hamnet\") leads Best Actress with 96% support, while the Best Picture race remains more contested [3]. Michael B. Jordan's SAG victory positioned him at **No. 2 in expert forecasts** for Best Actor, narrowing the race against Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (\"Marty Supreme\"), who despite winning Critics Choice and a Golden Globe, has seen his campaign described as lacking \"authenticity\" despite $157 million in worldwide grosses [2][3].\n\n## Key Differentiating Factors\n\nSeveral elements could tip the balance:\n- **Age and experience**: At 39, Jordan is nearly a decade older than Chalamet, potentially overcoming the Academy's historical bias against young performers [3]\n- **Campaign intensity**: \"Marty Supreme\" has generated significant marketing innovation but may have peaked too early [2]\n- **International voters**: Unlike SAG, the Academy includes substantial international membership that may respond differently to the two frontrunners [1]\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nWhile \"One Battle After Another\" maintains the statistical advantage through PGA and DGA wins\u2014the most reliable precursors historically\u2014\"Sinners\" has positioned itself as the alternative with the passion vote, particularly among actors. With Oscar voting having concluded on March 5, 2026 [2], the industry awaits the March 15 ceremony to see whether precedent or momentum prevails.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
