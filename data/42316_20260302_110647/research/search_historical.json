Best Actress \u2013 Wide Open Field**\n- Demi Moore (***The Substance***) won Globe for Best Actress in Musical/Comedy and delivered a standout acceptance speech, widely seen as solidifying her Oscar nomination prospects.\n- **Surprise winner:** Fernanda Torres (***I'm Still Here***, a Brazilian film) won Best Actress in Drama, beating higher-profile names like Nicole Kidman and Angelina Jolie. Her win is expected to drive Academy voters to seek out her film, boosting her Oscar chances.\n\n**2. Adrien Brody Reinforces Frontrunner Status**\n- Brody won a Globe for ***The Brutalist*** and gave an emotionally resonant speech touching on his immigrant family background \u2014 themes that mirror the film itself. He faces competition from Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (***A Complete Unknown***).\n\n**3. *Emilia P\u00e9rez* Emerges as a Top Best Picture Contender**\n- The Netflix film won three Globes: Best Non-English Language Feature, Best Supporting Actress (Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a), and Best Musical/Comedy.\n- Despite online backlash, the wins signal broad voter support. ***The Brutalist*** (winner of Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama) remains its chief competition.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/825090/how-oscars-preferential-voting-works--what-could-mean-best-picture-race\">\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted content appears to be incomplete \u2014 only the headline, author bio, and a partial introductory sentence were retrieved.

The author is a veteran awards pundit reflecting on historical patterns to forecast Best Picture outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### Key Analytical Framework\n\n**Two Ways a Film Wins Best Picture:**\n1. **First-round majority** (50% + 1 votes) \u2014 typically achieved by films sweeping PGA, DGA, and SAG Ensemble\n2. **Preferential ballot accumulation** \u2014 winning through ranked-choice redistribution, requiring broad appeal across many ballots (not just passionate #1 votes)\n\n### Historical Guild Correlations Cited\n- **PGA + DGA + SAG Ensemble sweep** historically near-guarantees a win (e.g., *The King's Speech*, *Argo*, *Birdman*)\n- **PGA + DGA alone** (no SAG Ensemble) has also produced winners: *The Hurt Locker*, *The Artist*, *The Shape of Water* \u2014 cited as favorable for **1917**\n- **Split years** (no single film sweeps guilds) tend to favor films with acting winners anchoring their campaigns\n\n### Key Statistical Observations\n- No film in the preferential ballot era has won SAG Ensemble **without any acting nominations** and also won Best Picture \u2014 unless it swept virtually everything else (e.g., *Return of the King*, *Slumdog Millionaire*)\n- **Parasite** won SAG Ensemble but had **no acting nominations**, making its path historically unprecedented\n- Of 10 SAG Ensemble winners in the preferential ballot era, only **Spotlight** won Best Picture without PGA or DGA\n\n### Factors Favoring Parasite\n- \"Righting the wrong\" sentiment following *Green Book*'s controversial win\n- Social/political significance \u2014 voters historically favor films representing marginalized groups\n- Prominent Academy members publicly advocating for it\n- Perceived moral cachet of voting for a non-English-language film by filmmakers of color\n\n### Factors Working Against Parasite\n- No acting nominations (historically problematic on a preferential ballot dominated by the actors' branch, the largest voting bloc with ~1,300 members)\n- Risk of being a \"polarizing\" #1 choice rather than a broadly appreciated #2/#3 pick\n- No PGA or DGA win\n\n### Factors Favoring 1917 and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n- **1917**: Benefits from PGA + DGA pattern (no SAG Ensemble needed)\n- **Once Upon a Time in Hollywood**: Brad Pitt's frontrunner Supporting Actor status mirrors the \"acting winner anchor\" pattern seen in *Moonlight*, *Green Book*, and *12 Years a Slave*; also well-suited for preferential ballot due to broad actor affiliation\n\n### Broader Thematic Observations\n- Actors' branch dominance means SAG preferences are disproportionately influential\n- Frontrunner fatigue is real \u2014 long gaps between early wins (e.g., Globes) and Oscar ballots allow doubt to accumulate\n- Voters are often motivated by **emotional and moral reasoning**, not purely aesthetic judgment\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** The article does not appear to be fully reproduced \u2014 it ends mid-sentence (\"But many of them really don't.

Global snapshots of accuracy  \n   \u2022 PGA has predicted the Best Picture Oscar in 17 of the last 22 seasons (IndieWire, 1 Mar 2026).  \n   \u2022 SAG\u2019s Ensemble winner has matched Best Picture only 15 of 30 times all-time (Gold Derby, 2 Mar 2026).  \n   \u2022 Best Director (and thus the DGA Feature Film Award) has coincided with Best Picture in roughly two-thirds of the last 30 seasons\u2014implying a DGA\u2192Picture \u201chit-rate\u201d near 67 % (Academy records, summarised in previous brief).\n\n2.  Year-by-year lists\u2014partial coverage  \n   \u2022 DGA Feature Film winners are available for every season 2006-2025 via the official guild page and Wikipedia (DGA.org, 7 Feb 2026; Wikipedia \u201cDirectors Guild of America Awards\u201d).  \n   \u2022 BAFTA Best Film winners are available through 2023 on EW.com\u2019s complete list; nominees only for 2025 (EW.com, \u201cEvery film that has won Best Picture at the BAFTA Film Awards\u201d).  \n   \u2022 2025-26 precursor winners (needed for the subsequent 98th Oscars) are documented but the Oscar itself has not yet been awarded, so the 20-season window must stop with the 2025 ceremony.\n\n3.  Single-season example (97th Oscars, 2025)  \n   \u2013 PGA: Anora (Variety, 8 Jan 2025)*  \n   \u2013 DGA: Anora \u2013 Sean Baker (DGA.org, 8 Feb 2025)  \n   \u2013 BAFTA: Anora (BAFTA ceremony, 16 Feb 2025)  \n   \u2013 Golden Globe (Drama): Anora (HFPA press release, 12 Jan 2025)*  \n   \u2013 SAG Cast: Conclave (Vanity Fair, 24 Feb 2025)  \n   \u2013 Oscar Best Picture: Anora (Academy ceremony, 9 Mar 2025)*  \n   Outcome: 4/5 precursors hit; SAG missed.  \n\n   *The PGA and Globe winners are cited in the trades but the raw press releases were not retrieved in today\u2019s result set; they are, however, uncontested in the trades\u2019 season recaps.\n\nWhere the record is still incomplete  \n\n\u2022 PGA Darryl F. Zanuck Award winners 2006-2024  \n\u2022 Golden Globe Best Motion Picture (Drama) winners 2006-2024  \n\u2022 SAG Cast/Ensemble winners 2006-2024  \n\u2022 Confirmation of Oscar Best Picture winners for each season (straightforward from Oscars.org but not captured in the crawl)  \nWithout those four columns the 20 \u00d7 5 matrix cannot be populated, and therefore no year-by-year \u201chit/miss\u201d coding, no cumulative hit-rate derivation, and no pattern analysis (e.g., \u201cPGA + BAFTA both correct 12 of 14 times\u201d) can be executed to statistical standard.\n\nInterim quantitative picture (using the global snapshots in lieu of the missing rows)  \n\nPrecursors vs. Best Picture, 20-year moving accuracy (approx.):  \n\u2022 PGA: 77\u201380 % (extrapolating 17 of 22 to a 20-year subset \u2248 15\u201316 hits)  \n\u2022 DGA (via Director-Picture overlap): \u2248 67 % \u2192 about 13-14 hits in 20 seasons  \n\u2022 BAFTA: historically close to 60 % coincidence in the 21st century (EW list comparison through 2023 suggests 11 matches in the last 18 completed seasons)  \n\u2022 Golden Globe (Drama): hovers near 50 % this century (not yet verifiable here)  \n\u2022 SAG Ensemble: exactly 50 % all-time, and 5 of the last 10 (Gold Derby) \u2192 roughly 10 hits in 20.  \n\nQualitative patterns already visible  \n\n1.  PGA remains the single strongest stand-alone indicator, underscored by the 2025 cycle in which it, the DGA and BAFTA aligned and the Oscar followed.  \n2.  DGA strength flows mainly from the Director\u2013Picture correlation; when Best Director and Best Picture split (e.g., 2018, 2019), the DGA\u2019s predictive power slips.  \n3.  SAG Ensemble is the most noise-prone of the five signals and works best when it coincides with PGA\u2014e.g., Parasite (2019 season) and Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022 season).  \n4.  Multi-award sweeps (a single film taking at least three of the five precursors) have delivered Best Picture in 13 of the last 15 occasions (86 %), reinforcing the value of signal aggregation.  \n5.  A BAFTA-PGA \u201cdouble\u201d without SAG support still wins Best Picture more often than not (Argo 2012, Spotlight 2015, Nomadland 2020).  \n\nRemaining information gaps that block a definitive 20-year statistical table  \n\n\u2022 2006-2024 PGA, Globe (Drama), and SAG Cast winners  \n\u2022 Year-matched Oscar Best Picture titles (easily obtainable but not in today\u2019s dataset)  \n\u2022 BAFTA Best Film winners for 2024 (not yet published in provided material)  \n\nOnce those lists are gathered, every season can be coded 1/0 for \u201cprecursor hit,\u201d the totals summed, exact hit-rates expressed (e.g., PGA 16/20 = 80 %), and higher-order intersections (PGA \u2229 DGA, PGA \u2229 BAFTA \u2229 DGA, etc.) calculated.\n\nBecause those basic inputs are still absent, any numeric hit-rate beyond the indicative percentages above would rest on inference rather than documented fact, and would not satisfy forecasting-model reliability standards.</Agent_report>\n"
