  "plan_analysis": "The forecaster\u2019s goal is to estimate which nominee\u2014Bugonia, Frankenstein, Sinners, or \u201cOther\u201d\u2014will be announced as Best Picture at the 98th Oscars in roughly two weeks.  \nAlready known: nothing beyond the question text.  \nNeeded evidence:\n\n1. Base rate / historical precedents  \n   \u2022 How reliably do precursor awards (PGA, DGA, BAFTA, Golden Globes, SAG Ensemble) predict Best Picture?  \n   \u2022 How often do upsets occur and under what conditions (e.g., preferential ballot quirks, vote-splits)?  \n   \u2022 Historical accuracy of betting markets.\n\n2. Resolution mechanism  \n   \u2022 Confirmation that oscars.org will publish the winner; mechanics are straightforward but a quick primer on preferential ballot voting can clarify drivers of surprise outcomes.\n\n3. Key drivers for 2026 race  \n   \u2022 Results of this season\u2019s precursor awards.  \n   \u2022 Current betting odds / prediction markets.  \n   \u2022 Industry commentary on campaign strength, controversies, or shifts in sentiment.\n\n4. Current state  \n   \u2022 Which film has already won the major precursors (PGA, BAFTA, etc.) and critics\u2019 awards.  \n   \u2022 Latest odds and pundit forecasts less than two weeks from ceremony.\n\n5. Contrarian check  \n   \u2022 Articles or commentary highlighting scenarios where the perceived front-runner could lose or where a vote-split boosts an underdog, informed by past upsets.\n\nThe eight queries below are designed to collect that evidence: five historical (base-rate, mechanism, upset frequency) and three current (recent precursor results, odds, expert commentary).",
