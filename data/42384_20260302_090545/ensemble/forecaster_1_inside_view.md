Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Programmatic Stock Return Distribution (Historical Base Rate Block):** Highest quality quantitative source. Empirically computed from actual PFE price data over 2,506 overlapping 9-trading-day windows. Factual, not opinion. Key: unconditional P(up) = 52.4%; top-decile filter P(up) = 58.3%; positive 5-day return filter P(up) = 53.8%; elevated volatility filter P(up) = 47.9%.

**KFF Article (HHS Policy Actions):** Reliable, non-partisan health policy tracker. Factual documentation of regulatory/policy changes (RFK Jr. as HHS Secretary, COVID vaccine mandate removal). Relevant as a headwind for Pfizer's vaccine revenues but not directly stock-price predictive over a 9-day window. Moderate quality, dated February 10, 2026.

**RTTNews (Metsera Acquisition, Feb 7, 2026):** News report citing Financial Times. Pfizer reportedly nearing $7.3B acquisition of obesity-focused biotech Metsera at $47.50/share + $22.50 contingent. This is a significant strategic development. The deal was expected to be announced "soon" as of Feb 7. By March 2, this news is ~3 weeks old and likely already priced in. Moderate quality (secondary source citing FT).

**BioSpace Layoff Tracker:** Pfizer not mentioned. Not relevant to PFE directly. Low relevance.

**Barchart Options Article (Jan 9, 2026):** Options activity analysis by Will Ashworth. PFE at ~$25.43 at time of writing. Identifies unusual put/call activity at $29 strike for March 20 expiration. Analyst opinion (not expert economist), but provides useful context: the $29 level was seen as a key strike. Now PFE is at $27.65, closer to that strike. Moderate quality, somewhat dated (Jan 9).

**Yahoo Finance Options Article (Jul 2, 2025):** Mark Hake, CFA — identifiable expert. Bullish interpretation of put-selling activity. Notes forward P/E of ~8.2x vs. historical 10.22x, implying ~28.6% upside. Dividend yield of 6.81% vs. historical 4.23%, indicating undervaluation. Factual valuation data. Moderate quality (8 months old but valuation framework still relevant).

**Barchart Options Article (Feb 6, 2026):** Will Ashworth. Q4 2025 earnings beat ($17.56B revenue, EPS $0.66 vs. $0.57 consensus). YTD performance +9.1% as of Feb 6. Analyst consensus target $28.43. PF-08653944 (once-monthly weight-loss drug) showing promising trial results. Chart described as "bottomed and slowly recovering." This is the most recent and directly relevant article to PFE's current trajectory. Moderate-high quality.

**AskNews Pharma Sector Articles:** Mostly focused on Chinese, Indian, and global pharma markets. Not directly relevant to PFE's 9-day price movement. The general pharma sector outlook is positive (AI integration, injectable drug growth, M&A activity), but these are long-term structural factors. Low-moderate relevance for a 9-day prediction.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- Historical base rate: P(up over 9 days) = 52.4% unconditional. Top-decile filter (currently applicable) shows 58.3%. These are computed from 2,506 actual data points — strong statistical foundation.
- PFE is near its 52-week high ($27.65 vs. 52-week high $27.94). The top-decile filter is clearly applicable and historically associated with momentum continuation rather than mean reversion for PFE.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Q4 2025 earnings beat (Feb 3, 2026): Revenue $17.56B (+$61M vs. consensus), EPS $0.66 (+$0.09 vs. consensus). This positive catalyst was ~4 weeks ago. Likely partially priced in but supports a constructive fundamental backdrop.
- Analyst consensus target of $28.43 vs. current ~$27.65: ~2.8% upside to consensus. Modest fundamental tailwind.
- Metsera acquisition ($7.3B): Strategic re-entry into obesity market. If confirmed/announced, could be a positive catalyst. But 3 weeks old — likely priced in.
- PF-08653944 obesity drug data: Promising trial results for once-monthly injectable. Positive pipeline signal. Partially priced in.
- Elevated 30-day volatility (24.3% annualized): Historically associated with P(up) = 47.9% (below median filter). Negative adjustment.
- Recent strong run: +3.75% over 5 days (89th percentile), +6.92% over 1 month (85th percentile). Some mean-reversion risk, though not at extreme levels.

**Weak evidence:**
- RFK Jr./MAHA Commission headwinds for vaccine revenues: Long-term structural concern, not 9-day price driver.
- Bullish technical signals from Intellectia.ai (5 bullish vs. 1 bearish): Algorithmic, unverified source. Corroborating but not authoritative.
- General pharma sector positive outlook (injectable drugs, AI integration): Long-term structural, not 9-day relevant.
- Broader market uncertainty (tariffs, geopolitical tensions noted in Indian market articles): Macro headwind, but indirect.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The prediction window is **9 trading days** (March 2 to March 13, 2026). This is a very short window where:
- Mean expected return is only +0.24% (essentially flat)
- Standard deviation is 4.41% (substantial uncertainty)
- The outcome is close to a coin flip even with favorable conditions

**If halved (4-5 trading days):** The prediction would move closer to 50% — less time for any directional trend to materialize, higher noise-to-signal ratio. Probably ~52-53%.

**If doubled (18 trading days):** More time for fundamental catalysts (analyst upgrades, potential Metsera deal confirmation, obesity drug news) to materialize. The positive momentum and near-52-week-high positioning would have more time to play out. Probably ~55-57%.

The 9-day window is short enough that the outcome is largely noise-driven, with only modest adjustments from current conditions.

**(d) Justification**

Starting from the unconditional base rate of **52.4%**:

**Top-decile price filter (+5.8pp):** PFE at $27.65 vs. 52-week high of $27.94 — clearly in top decile. This is the strongest applicable signal. Historical data shows 58.3% P(up) in this condition. This is a structural momentum signal: stocks near 52-week highs tend to continue rising more often than reverting. **+5.8pp → 58.2%**

**Positive 5-day return (+1.3pp):** The stock gained +3.75% over the past 5 days (89th percentile). Historical data shows 53.8% P(up) when prior 5-day return is positive. Modest additional momentum signal. **+1.3pp → 59.5%**

**Elevated 30-day volatility (-4.5pp):** 30-day realized vol of 24.3% annualized is above median. Historical data shows 47.9% P(up) in this condition. This is a significant negative adjustment — elevated volatility increases uncertainty and historically correlates with slightly lower probability of positive returns. **-4.5pp → 55.0%**

**Recent strong run (partial mean-reversion risk, -1.5pp):** The 5-day return at the 89th percentile and 1-month at the 85th percentile suggest some potential for consolidation. However, the 3-month return of +9.30% does not trigger the extreme >20% filter (which shows only 17.1% P(up)). The mean-reversion risk is real but modest. **-1.5pp → 53.5%**

**Fundamental backdrop (modest positive, +1.0pp):** Q4 2025 earnings beat, analyst consensus target above current price ($28.43 vs. $27.65), Metsera acquisition providing strategic optionality in obesity market, PF-08653944 pipeline progress. These are positive but largely priced in. **+1.0pp → 54.5%**

**Macro/policy headwinds (modest negative, -0.5pp):** RFK Jr./MAHA Commission creating long-term vaccine revenue uncertainty; broader market uncertainty from tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Not 9-day drivers but create slight headwind. **-0.5pp → 54.0%**

**Net estimate: ~54%**

The competing factors roughly balance out, with the top-decile momentum signal being the strongest positive factor, partially offset by elevated volatility. The result is a modest positive tilt above the unconditional base rate.

---

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view estimate was 54.2%. My inside view analysis confirms this range. The key factors:

1. The top-decile filter is the most powerful applicable signal (+5.8pp), but it's substantially offset by elevated volatility (-4.5pp).
2. The fundamental backdrop is positive but largely priced in.
3. The 9-day window is short enough that any directional signal is weak relative to noise.
4. No major upcoming catalysts identified within the resolution window (March 2-13) that would dramatically shift the probability.

I maintain my estimate at approximately **54%**.

---

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria paraphrase:** Will PFE's closing price on March 13, 2026 be higher than its closing price on March 2, 2026? (9 trading days)

2. **Outside view base rate:** 52.4% unconditional; adjusted to ~54% after applicable conditional filters.

3. **Consistency check:** "54 out of 100 times, PFE closes higher on March 13 than on March 2." This is consistent with a near-coin-flip with modest positive tilt from momentum/top-decile signals.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - Top-decile 52-week range position → historically 58.3% P(up) [factually valid, computed from 254 data points]
   - Elevated 30-day volatility → historically 47.9% P(up) [factually valid, computed from 1,238 data points]
   - Q4 2025 earnings beat (EPS $0.66 vs. $0.57 consensus) [factually reported by Barchart, Feb 6, 2026]
   - Analyst consensus target $28.43 vs. current $27.65 [factually reported, Feb 6, 2026]
   - Recent 5-day return +3.75% (89th percentile) [factually computed from price data]

5. **Blind-spot statement:** If the Metsera acquisition announcement triggers a negative market reaction (deal skepticism, dilution concerns), or if broader market weakness accelerates due to tariff escalation, PFE could fall 3-5% in the window, making my ~54% estimate look too high. This scenario might push probability to ~45-48%.

6. **Status quo outcome:** The stock is currently at $27.65 and has been on a strong uptrend. The status quo (continued modest upward drift) slightly favors a "Yes" resolution, consistent with my ~54% estimate.

Probability: 54%
