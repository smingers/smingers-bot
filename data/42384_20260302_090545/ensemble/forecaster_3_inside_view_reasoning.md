**Analyzing PFE forecast**

I need to forecast PFE's price between the close on March 2 and March 13. My outside view suggests a 54.2% chance. I should adjust this with the inside view, considering recent news about policy headwinds and a possible acquisition. The stock's near its 52-week high, and we have elevated volatility, which might indicate mean reversion. I should also look into dividend dates, as ex-dividend dates could affect closing prices. Pfizer typically pays dividends in early months, which could be a factor.**Evaluating PFE outlook**

I'm feeling uncertain about PFE's outlook as macro factors like an upcoming Fed meeting could influence market sentiment, even though it's outside my forecasting window. US-Iran tensions might make the market risk-off, which could help defensive sectors like pharma. The rumored Metsera acquisition could also impact PFE positively, though acquisitions may bring short-term costs. The potential for a deal announcement is near, but it might already be priced in. I'll lean toward an outside view but consider a slightly optimistic adjustment given the defensive sector's potential.**Setting PFE analysis parameters**

On one hand, I'm seeing high volatility with PFE near its 52-week high, which may lead to profit-taking; however, the base rate might already account for that. I think I’ll set my inside view at around 55%. I’ll need to provide detailed source analysis and evidence weighting within a specific format, including the timeframe of 11 calendar days or 9 trading days. I should also consider halving or doubling as needed. Time to craft this structured analysis!
