Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. “Stock Return Distribution (programmatic analysis)” – Clean, quantitative, directly relevant, based on daily PFE prices through 1 Mar 2026. High-quality factual data.  
2. FT / RTTNews (7 Feb 2026) – report of a potential $7.3 bn Metsera takeover. Primary source = FT; reliable, though deal not yet announced. Factual but conditional.  
3. Barchart options pieces (9 Jan & 6 Feb 2026) – descriptive statistics on options flow. Reputable market-data site; information is factual; author opinions are mild.  
4. Kaiser Family Foundation policy tracker (updated 10 Feb 2026) – historical policy events; tangential to nine-day share price; low immediate relevance.  
5. AskNews pharma-sector outlooks (1-2 Mar 2026) – mostly Asia-facing macro pieces; useful for broad sentiment, weak for PFE-specific price in short window.  
Overall, the only high-signal near-term inputs are (1) historical price stats and (2) the unconfirmed Metsera M&A rumour; the rest are low-weight opinion or sector background.

(b) Evidence analysis (using Strong/Moderate/Weak framework)  
• Strong: 20-year history shows PFE closes higher than nine-days-earlier in 52.4 % of 2 506 windows.  
• Moderate(+): “Price in top decile of 52-wk range” bump raises win-rate to 58.3 % (N = 254).  
• Moderate(+): Five-day positive momentum (+3.8 %) historically nudges probability to 53.8 %.  
• Moderate(-): 30-day volatility above median shaves probability to 47.9 %.  
• Weak(+): Options flow in early Feb biased to bullish spreads, hinting at mild upside expectations by traders.  
• Weak(+/-): Pending Metsera deal – could add “obesity drug optionality” narrative, but $7 bn cash cost may negate. Net short-term impact likely small.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in nine NYSE sessions (≈ 1.5 weeks). 9-day σ ≈ 4.4 %; a ±1.2 $ swing (≈ 4.3 %) decides outcome. If horizon were halved to 4 days, history reduces base win-rate to 51 %; if doubled to 18 days, base rises to ~53 %. So probability is not highly time-scale-sensitive within ±2×.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start at unconditional 52.4 %.  
+3 pp for “top-decile” price position (momentum & mean-reversion mix).  
+1 pp for recent positive 5-day return.  
–2 pp for above-median realised volatility (risk of pull-back).  
+1 pp for mildly bullish options positioning.  
0 pp net for Metsera rumour (direction ambiguous, announcement timing uncertain).  
Aggregate (recognising indicator overlap, so shrink 50 %): +1.5 pp.  
Outside-view 52.4 % ⇒ Inside-view ≈ 53.9 %.  I round to 54 %.

Status-quo continuation (flat market) would very slightly favour a No outcome because any one-day dip would put 13 Mar below 2 Mar; hence my forecast leans only modestly above 50 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in roughly 54 out of 100 comparable nine-day windows, PFE will finish above its 2 Mar 2026 close.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between 2 Mar and 13 Mar 2026 will PFE close higher? Binary yes/no.”  
2. Outside base rate = 52.4 %.  
3. Consistency – “54 of 100 times, PFE ends up higher after nine sessions.”  
4. Key evidence (≤ 20 words each):  
   • Long-run 9-day up-rate 52 %.  
   • Price currently top decile of 52-wk range (historic P↑ 58 %).  
   • Positive 5-day momentum.  
   • Above-median realised vol trims edge.  
   • M&A rumour/option flow gives slight bullish skew.  
5. Blind-spot – Sudden negative headline (e.g., safety halt for major trial) could sink shares ≥ 5 % quickly.  
6. Status-quo bias – With no scheduled catalyst, drift to mean argues for only slight deviation from 50 %.

Probability: 54%
