**Analyzing forecast probabilities**

I need to produce a forecast probability related to whether PFE will close higher on March 13, 2026, than on March 2, 2026. The key question is if the price on March 13 will be strictly higher than 27.65, which is the closing price for March 2. Today is March 2, and we don't yet have the closing price; they referenced 27.65 from March 1. It looks like we should proceed with the forecast despite this uncertainty. I'll consider the timeframe, which includes 9 trading days, and previously noted a 53% probability from our outside view. Now I need to refine that considering current news and catalysts.**Evaluating near-term catalysts**

I’m looking at key near-term catalysts, especially the potential acquisition of Metsera, which has been rumored since early February and may finalize before March 13. If the terms are favorable, it could boost the stock, but the $7.3 billion cash cost might lead to a slightly negative market reaction, tempered by positive expectations from their obesity pipeline. Historically, Pfizer's acquisitions have caused modest short-term movements. 

Currently, the S&P could see volatility due to geopolitical tensions, yet they've achieved a +3.75% return in the last five days. Options activity shows the market anticipates a 6.96% move by March 20, leading me to a modest adjustment in my assessment to a probability of around 54-55%. Finally, I’ll craft my analysis around these insights.
