**Analyzing stock probability**

I'm looking to determine the probability that PFE's closing price on March 13, 2026, will be higher than its closing price on March 2, 2026. I need to analyze various factors, such as source analysis, reference class, timeframe analysis, and justification. Given historical data, the unconditional probability of a positive return over nine days is 52.4%. However, high volatility and price positioning in the top decile may lower this probability to around 47.9%. Now, I'll weigh these factors for a final probability assessment.**Evaluating probability factors**

I need to enumerate the conditions affecting PFE. First, the price is near a 52-week high, which boosts the probability by 5.8% to 58.3%. The 5-day positive momentum adds another 1.3%, bringing it to 53.8%. However, the 30-day volatility above median decreases this to 47.9%. 

I’m considering these factors as potentially independent, leading to a rough estimate of around 54%. For my analysis, I’ll rely on reliable sources and a historical dataset of 9 trading days for PFE. Let’s finalize a proposed probability of 53%.
