Analysis:
The forecaster already has (a) the exact resolution rule (Yahoo Finance close on 2026-03-13 vs. 2026-03-02) and (b) a programmatic base-rate table for PFE’s own 9-trading-day returns plus a few simple conditional slices.  
What is still missing:

1. Deeper base rates  
   • How often does PFE rise in early-to-mid-March specifically (seasonality)?  
   • How does its 9-day win-rate compare with large-pharma peers and the S&P 500?  
   • How sensitive is PFE to market moves over a 9-day window (beta/context)?  
   • A more granular conditional base-rate calculation that matches the current set-up (price near 52-wk high + positive 5-day return).

2. Key drivers / catalysts inside the forecast window  
   • Any scheduled FDA/PDUFA decisions, clinical-trial read-outs, or conference presentations between 3-Mar and 13-Mar 2026.  
   • Corporate events (M&A chatter, dividend or share-buy-back announcements, litigation rulings).  
   • Sector-wide or macro events (CPI release 03-10, FOMC blackout, etc.) that historically move drug-maker stocks.

3. Contrarian indicators  
   • Unusual options flow or short-interest spikes signalling informed positioning.  
   • Analyst downgrades or negative news that could offset the recent positive momentum.

The search strategy therefore splits roughly 60 % historical (to strengthen the statistical anchor and sector context) and 40 % current (to surface catalysts or surprises that could swing the stock in the next 9 trading days).
