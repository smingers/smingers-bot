The author analyzed the 20 prior instances to assess what forward 12-month returns typically look like after such streaks.\n\n### Key Statistics: Post-Streak Forward 12-Month Returns (20 historical instances)\n| Metric | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Positive outcomes | 14/20 (70%) |\n| Average return | 7.2% |\n| Median return | 5.7% |\n| Range | -35.7% to +38.1% |\n\n### Comparison: All 12-Month Forward Returns (~1,166 data points, ~100 years)\n| Metric | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Positive outcomes | 69.2% |\n| Average return | 8.1% |\n| **Median return** | **9.8%** |\n\n### Key Takeaway (from the article)\n- The **probability of positive returns** after a seven-month streak (~70%) is nearly **identical** to the base rate for any random 12-month period (~69%).\n- However, the **median forward return after a streak (5.7%) is roughly half** the overall historical median (9.8%), suggesting **below-average returns are historically likely** following such streaks.\n- The author explicitly notes the **small sample size (20)** as a limitation but concludes that **underperformance relative to long-term averages appears likely** following the completed streak.\n\n*Note: This article focuses on broad S&P 500 index behavior and does not specifically address PFE/Pfizer.*\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Analyze Pfizer daily price data since 2000 to compute probability its close price is higher after 9 trading days when current price is in top decile of 52-week range and prior 5-day return is positive; compare against unconditional rate.\nThe focal question is whether the market-close price of Pfizer Inc. (PFE) tends to be higher nine trading days after today when (a) today\u2019s price sits in the upper-10 % of its trailing 52-week range and (b) the trailing 5-day return is positive.  \nUsing a daily history that runs from 02 Jan 2000 through 27 Feb 2026 (\u2248 6 700 calendar days; 5 000+ NYSE sessions), 2 506 overlapping, non-holiday 9-day return windows were constructed.\u00b9 Each window records:\n\n\u2022 day t close,  \n\u2022 9-day forward close (t + 9),  \n\u2022 whether day t close is in the top decile of the rolling 52-week high/low band,  \n\u2022 whether the backward-looking 5-day close-to-close return ending on day t is positive.\n\nKey unconditional result  \n\u2022 Across all 2 506 windows, the next-9-trading-day return is positive 52.4 % of the time (mean = +0.24 %, \u03c3 = 4.41 %). (Historical base rate block in prompt.)\n\nSingle-factor conditional results  \n\u2022 Price in top decile of 52-week range only \u2192 P(up | High-Decile) = 58.3 % (254 cases, +5.8 pp vs. unconditional).  \n\u2022 5-day return > 0 only \u2192 P(up | Pos 5d) = 53.8 % (1 296 cases, +1.3 pp).  \n(Same source block.)\n\nInterpretation so far  \nBoth signals on a stand-alone basis tilt the odds modestly in favour of a 9-day gain, with the 52-week-range filter being noticeably stronger than the momentum filter.\n\nMissing joint statistic  \nThe original query, however, requires the joint probability:\n\n\u2003P(up | High-Decile AND Pos 5d)\n\nThat number is not present in the extracted summary. To compute it we need:\n\u2003\u2022 The count of windows that simultaneously satisfy both conditions, and  \n\u2003\u2022 Within that subset, the count whose 9-day return is positive.\n\nNeither count appears in the available search results, and it cannot be derived from the marginal counts alone without an independence assumption, which is unsafe because price-level and recent-momentum variables are typically correlated.\n\nWhy the joint figure matters  \nIf the two filters are positively associated (likely), the joint subset will be smaller than 254 yet more momentum-loaded than the whole High-Decile set; the conditional win-rate could therefore be higher than 58.3 %\u2014but we cannot say by how much without the raw cross-tabulation.\n\nData sufficiency assessment  \n\u2022 Daily price history back to 2000 is confirmed as available from multiple vendors (Barchart \u201cDaily data\u2026back to 01/01/2000\u201d; Wiener B\u00f6rse export; Yahoo Finance).  \n\u2022 The summary stats needed for unconditional and single-factor conditions are already computed.  \n\u2022 The one statistic still required\u2014the joint conditional win-rate\u2014must be calculated directly from the underlying window-level dataset.\n\nConclusion  \n1. Unconditional probability of PFE closing higher nine trading days later: 52.4 %.  \n2. With only the \u201ctop-decile\u201d filter applied: 58.3 %.  \n3. With only the \u201cpositive 5-day return\u201d filter applied: 53.8 %.  \n4. The probability conditional on both filters simultaneously cannot be stated from the current information; the raw window data (or at minimum a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table) is still needed.\n\nRemaining information gap  \n\u2022 Joint distribution of the two conditioning variables vs. 9-day outcome.\n\nWithout it, we cannot finish the requested comparison (\u201ccompute probability \u2026 when current price is in top decile and prior 5-day return is positive; compare against unconditional rate\u201d) with full precision.\n\nSource notes  \n\u00b9 Computations referenced in \u201c=== STOCK RETURN DISTRIBUTION ===\u201d block of the prompt (Yahoo Finance prices, programme output).  \nAdditional confirmation of historical data availability: Barchart daily file coverage to 2000 (barchart.com, Price-History page) and Wiener B\u00f6rse export listing for 2000-26 data (wienerborse.at).</Agent_report>\n"
