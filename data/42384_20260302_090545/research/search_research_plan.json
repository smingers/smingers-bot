  "plan_analysis": "The forecaster already has (a) the exact resolution rule (Yahoo Finance close on 2026-03-13 vs. 2026-03-02) and (b) a programmatic base-rate table for PFE\u2019s own 9-trading-day returns plus a few simple conditional slices.  \nWhat is still missing:\n\n1. Deeper base rates  \n   \u2022 How often does PFE rise in early-to-mid-March specifically (seasonality)?  \n   \u2022 How does its 9-day win-rate compare with large-pharma peers and the S&P 500?  \n   \u2022 How sensitive is PFE to market moves over a 9-day window (beta/context)?  \n   \u2022 A more granular conditional base-rate calculation that matches the current set-up (price near 52-wk high + positive 5-day return).\n\n2. Key drivers / catalysts inside the forecast window  \n   \u2022 Any scheduled FDA/PDUFA decisions, clinical-trial read-outs, or conference presentations between 3-Mar and 13-Mar 2026.  \n   \u2022 Corporate events (M&A chatter, dividend or share-buy-back announcements, litigation rulings).  \n   \u2022 Sector-wide or macro events (CPI release 03-10, FOMC blackout, etc.) that historically move drug-maker stocks.\n\n3. Contrarian indicators  \n   \u2022 Unusual options flow or short-interest spikes signalling informed positioning.  \n   \u2022 Analyst downgrades or negative news that could offset the recent positive momentum.\n\nThe search strategy therefore splits roughly 60 % historical (to strengthen the statistical anchor and sector context) and 40 % current (to surface catalysts or surprises that could swing the stock in the next 9 trading days).",
