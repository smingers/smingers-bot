    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/42135\n- Original question title: Will the UK increase the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years before May 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-03-01: 55.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before May 1, 2026, the baseline qualifying period for settlement (permanent residency) in the UK is 10 or more years.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> To qualify a change must affect at least some applicants for permanent residency before May 2026. If a change is announced, but does not come in to effect before May 1, 2026, it will not be sufficient to resolve this question.\n> \n> This question will not consider any modifications that change the residency requirement; only the baseline requirement will matter for this question.\n> \n> If the baseline requirement is increased for some visa categories but not others, this question will resolve according to how the new baseline would have applied to the majority of grants in [the year ending September 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-september-2025/how-many-indefinite-leave-settlement-and-euss-settled-status-and-citizenship-grants-have-been-issued-in-the-uk#s-2).\n\nOriginal background: \n> Immigrants to the UK can currently apply for permanent residency \u2013 or \"indefinite leave to remain\" \u2013 after living in the country [for 5 years under most visa categories](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain#:~:text=You%20must%20usually%20have%20lived%20and%20worked%20in%20the%20UK%20for%205%20years).\n> \n> Shabana Mahmood, the Home Secretary, has proposed a change to the requirements to apply for this status; the core changes proposed include increasing [the baseline requirement to 10 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#:~:text=a\\)%20increasing%20the%20baseline%20qualifying%20period%20for%20settlement%20to%2010%20years) while also introducing modifying factors which may increase or reduce this period.\n> \n> This change is driven by [forecasts of record high applications](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#future-settlement-forecast) for residency over the next five years and a backdrop of [21% of British people polled](https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx) considering immigration to be Britain's \"biggest national problem\".\n> \n> In November 2025, Mahmood indicated that the changes would come into effect [in April 2026.](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-11-20/debates/E3CE324D-7597-40C5-8697-DB48AA843CFC/MigrationSettlementPathway#contribution-44475956-0A57-466A-A4EA-7A7FD64AAD83)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":42135,\"question_id\":41903,\"last_cp\":0.55}}`",

If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-03-13 03:38:43 is higher than 55.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 55.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-03-13 03:38:43, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
