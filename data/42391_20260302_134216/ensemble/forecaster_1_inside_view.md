Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

1. **FreeMovement.org.uk (Feb 2026)** - Immigration law commentary site. High quality for immigration law analysis. Confirms consultation closed Feb 12, 2026; 10-year baseline remains central proposal; April 2026 implementation target still live. Factual: consultation timeline, policy details. Opinion: proposals should be reconsidered.

2. **VisaHQ (Feb 14, 2026)** - Commercial visa services. Article about eVisa transition, not relevant to settlement qualifying period question.

3. **Lewis Silkin (Dec 24, 2025)** - Reputable immigration law firm. High quality. Confirms consultation closed Feb 12, 2026; new Immigration Rules could be introduced "as early as April 2026." Factual: mandatory minimum requirements, timeline.

4. **VisaHQ (Feb 11, 2026)** - References The Guardian as underlying source. Confirms 10-year proposal active; nursing leaders warn of NHS impact; IPPR estimates 300,000 children affected. Moderate quality.

5. **Erickson Immigration Group (Nov 25, 2025)** - Immigration law firm. Confirms Home Secretary stated November 20, 2025 that implementation intended for April 2026 Statement of Changes. High quality for timeline confirmation.

6. **Hansard Society (Mar 2, 2026)** - Reputable parliamentary monitoring organization. Parliamentary business bulletin. Notes statutory instruments on "social security immigration" scheduled; Home Office ministers face scrutiny. No direct information on settlement qualifying period.

7. **AskNews - Anadolu Ajansı (Mar 2, 2026)** - Wire service. Reports UK government announced refugee status reduced to 30 months effective immediately (March 2, 2026). **Critical new information**: This is a concrete policy action taken TODAY. The article also notes "Under a broader reform announced in November, refugees may eventually have to wait 20 years to qualify for permanent residence, a provision pending parliamentary vote." This suggests the broader earned settlement changes are still pending parliamentary vote.

8. **AskNews - smobserved.com (Feb 11, 2026)** - Lower quality source but contains useful aggregated data. States government has "introduced tougher policies, including doubling the wait for indefinite leave to remain from five to ten years" — but this appears to be describing proposed/announced policies, not implemented ones.

9. **AskNews - Express (Feb 28, 2026)** - Reputable UK tabloid. Notes Home Secretary Mahmood "preparing a speech to advocate for reducing migration." Confirms policy direction but no implementation announcement.

10. **AskNews - Manchester Evening News (Feb 28, 2026)** - Reputable regional news. Notes "Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is expected to warn against a leftward shift, introducing tougher immigration legislation next week." This suggests legislation was expected in early March 2026.

11. **The Guardian (Feb 20, 2026)** - High quality. Confirms changes "could be in force by April 2026" and expected to apply retroactively. Consultation closed Feb 12. Factual and reliable.

12. **YouGov article** - High quality polling organization. Covers Reform UK's ILR abolition proposal, not directly Labour's 10-year proposal. Shows public divided on ILR changes.

13. **Connaught Law** - Immigration advisory website. Notes April 2026 implementation target; 265,000+ petition signatures opposing retroactive application. Moderate quality.

14. **Britain's Awakening (Medium.com, Feb 28, 2026)** - Low quality source (Medium blog). Contains aggregated polling data but source reliability uncertain.

15. **Multiple AskNews articles on Reform UK ICE-style policies (Feb 23, 2026)** - Various quality. Confirm immigration remains politically salient but not directly relevant to implementation timeline.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Multiple reliable sources (Lewis Silkin, Erickson, Guardian, FreeMovement) confirm April 2026 implementation target** — the Home Secretary explicitly stated this in Parliament on November 20, 2025. This is a strong directional signal that the policy is advancing toward implementation before May 2026. (Shifts CP upward)

- **Consultation closed February 12, 2026** — the next formal step would be a Statement of Changes to immigration rules. The government has a clear stated intention to implement by April 2026. (Shifts CP upward)

- **Anadolu Ajansı (March 2, 2026) reports refugee status change implemented immediately** — this shows the government IS actively implementing immigration changes NOW. However, the same article notes the broader earned settlement changes (20-year wait for permanent residence) are "pending parliamentary vote," suggesting the full earned settlement framework hasn't been implemented yet. (Mixed signal — some changes happening, but the specific 10-year ILR change may still be pending)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Manchester Evening News (Feb 28, 2026) notes Mahmood "introducing tougher immigration legislation next week"** — this suggests formal legislative/regulatory action was expected in early March 2026. If this happened, the CP on the target question would likely have risen above 55%. (Shifts CP upward)

- **Employment Law Worldview (referenced in outside view) suggests "Summer 2026" implementation** — this is a credible immigration law source suggesting the timeline may slip past May 2026. (Shifts CP downward)

- **Anadolu Ajansı note that 20-year refugee route is "pending parliamentary vote"** — suggests the broader earned settlement framework requires parliamentary approval, which may delay implementation past April 2026. (Shifts CP downward)

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Political pressure from Reform UK and polling data** — strong public demand for immigration restrictions creates political incentive to implement quickly, but doesn't guarantee the April 2026 timeline. (Slight upward shift)

- **Petition signatures (265,000+) opposing retroactive application** — shows opposition but unlikely to stop implementation. (Minimal effect)

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

The meta-question resolves on **March 13, 2026** — 11 days from now. The target question (whether UK increases qualifying period to 10 years before May 2026) has its own resolution date of May 1, 2026.

The CP on the target question is currently 55.00%. For this meta-question to resolve Yes, the CP must be **strictly greater than** 55.00% on March 13.

**If timeframe were halved (5-6 days):** Less time for new information to arrive; CP more likely to stay near 55%. Probability of Yes would decrease to ~40%.

**If timeframe were doubled (22 days):** More time for potential government announcements (Statement of Changes in March); probability of Yes would increase to ~55%.

The 11-day window is critical. The Manchester Evening News article from Feb 28 suggested Mahmood was "introducing tougher immigration legislation next week" (i.e., first week of March 2026). If this happened and was reported, the Metaculus CP would likely have moved upward.

**(d) Justification:**

Starting from the outside view base rate of **45%** (CP must move strictly above 55% from exactly 55.00%).

**Upward adjustments:**
1. The government has a stated April 2026 implementation target, and the consultation closed Feb 12. The next step (Statement of Changes) could come in March. The Manchester Evening News article from Feb 28 specifically mentioned Mahmood was expected to introduce "tougher immigration legislation next week" (early March). If this happened, the CP would likely rise above 55%. This is a significant upward factor. (+8%)

2. The government implemented the refugee status change (30 months) on March 2, 2026, showing active implementation of immigration reforms. This demonstrates the government is moving quickly on immigration policy. (+3%)

3. Strong political incentives (Reform UK threat, by-election loss, low approval ratings) push the government to act quickly on immigration. (+2%)

**Downward adjustments:**
1. The Anadolu Ajansı article notes the broader earned settlement framework (including 20-year refugee route) is "pending parliamentary vote" — suggesting the full framework may not be implemented by April 2026 via simple Statement of Changes. The 10-year ILR change might face similar parliamentary process requirements. (-5%)

2. The Employment Law Worldview source (referenced in outside view) suggested Summer 2026 implementation, indicating expert uncertainty about the April timeline. (-3%)

3. The CP being at exactly 55.00% means it must move strictly above — even a slight downward drift would resolve No. The status quo (no movement) also resolves No. (-2%)

Net adjustment from 45%: +8+3+2-5-3-2 = +3%

**Inside view prediction: ~48%**

However, I want to reconsider the Manchester Evening News signal more carefully. The article from February 28 said Mahmood was expected to introduce "tougher immigration legislation next week" — this would be the week of March 2-8, 2026. If this happened and was reported on Metaculus, the CP for the target question would likely have risen above 55%.

But "legislation" could refer to the refugee status change (30 months) that was indeed announced on March 2, 2026, rather than the earned settlement/ILR changes. The Anadolu Ajansı article confirms the refugee status change happened, but notes the broader settlement framework is still pending.

This makes me think the "tougher immigration legislation" that was introduced was the refugee status change, NOT the 10-year ILR change. This would mean the CP for the target question may not have risen significantly.

Revised inside view: **~45%**

The CP is at 55.00% and needs to be strictly above 55.00%. The evidence is roughly balanced, with slight lean toward the status quo (CP stays near 55% or drifts slightly). Given the meta-question requires strict inequality (>55%, not ≥55%), and the CP is at exactly the threshold, I'll set my final prediction at **45%**.

---

**Probability Calibration:**

The outside view base rate was 45%. The inside view analysis finds:
- Moderate upward pressure from government's stated April 2026 timeline and active immigration policy implementation
- Moderate downward pressure from the refugee status change (March 2) being the "tougher legislation" introduced, not the ILR change
- The strict inequality requirement (>55%, not ≥55%) creates a slight disadvantage for Yes
- Net effect: approximately neutral adjustment from base rate

Final prediction: **45%**

---

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the Metaculus CP for "UK increases ILR qualifying period to 10 years before May 2026" be strictly above 55% on March 13, 2026?

2. **Outside view base rate**: 45% — CP at exactly threshold with 11 days remaining; needs to move strictly above.

3. **Consistency check**: "45 out of 100 times, the Metaculus CP for the target question will be strictly greater than 55% on March 13, 2026." This makes sense given the CP is exactly at 55% and evidence is mixed.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - Government stated April 2026 implementation target (upward)
   - Refugee status change implemented March 2, 2026 (mixed — shows action but may be the "legislation" referenced)
   - Earned settlement framework "pending parliamentary vote" per Anadolu Ajansı (downward)
   - Manchester Evening News: Mahmood introducing "tougher immigration legislation next week" as of Feb 28 (upward, but likely refers to refugee change)
   - Employment Law Worldview: Summer 2026 implementation more likely (downward)

5. **Blind spot**: If the government published a formal Statement of Changes to immigration rules implementing the 10-year ILR change in the first week of March 2026 (which would be consistent with the April 2026 implementation target), the CP would have jumped well above 55%, and my prediction of 45% would look too low.

6. **Status quo**: The CP is at exactly 55.00%. Without new information, it would likely stay near 55%. The status quo outcome is No (CP stays at or below 55%).

Probability: 45%
