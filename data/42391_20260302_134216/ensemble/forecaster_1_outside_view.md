Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

1. **UK Gov Settlement Statistics (Year Ending Sept 2025)**: High-quality primary government source. Confirms the consultation was opened in November 2025 but provides no information on whether the policy has been implemented. Current rules still at 5 years.

2. **GOV.UK ILR guidance page**: Official government page reflecting current rules (5-year baseline). No indication the 10-year change has been implemented as of retrieval date.

3. **"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" consultation documents (two sources)**: Primary government documents (Command Paper CP 1448). High reliability. Confirms the proposal to increase to 10 years, with Home Secretary indicating April 2026 implementation. Consultation ran 12 weeks from November 2025, ending ~February 12, 2026.

4. **Gallup poll (February 11, 2026)**: High-quality polling data confirming strong public concern about immigration in the UK, providing political context for the policy push.

5. **BBC article (November 20, 2025)**: Reputable news source confirming the announcement and planned "spring 2026" rollout. Consultation ends February 12, 2026.

6. **Employment Law Worldview (December 8, 2025)**: Professional advisory source. Importantly notes implementation likely "Summer 2026 onwards" — suggesting the change may NOT come into effect before May 2026.

7. **Agent report on Metaculus prediction dynamics**: Confirms that community predictions do move materially in final days/weeks, but no specific base rate data for the crossing-55% phenomenon was found.

8. **Wikipedia on ILR**: General reference, no information on proposed reforms.

9. **Other sources (forecasting-tools, AGI forecasting, Metaculus benchmarking)**: Irrelevant to the substantive question.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

The meta-question asks: Will the Metaculus community prediction for question #42135 be **higher than 55%** on March 13, 2026?

The current community prediction as of March 1, 2026 is exactly **55.00%**.

Relevant reference classes:
1. **Metaculus binary questions where CP is exactly at threshold**: When a CP sits at exactly 55%, the probability it moves above vs. below is roughly symmetric unless there's a directional information catalyst expected.
2. **Policy questions approaching resolution with pending government decisions**: These tend to see CP movement when new information arrives (e.g., official announcements).
3. **UK immigration policy questions with April 2026 target dates**: The resolution window is before May 2026; the government indicated April 2026 implementation.

The most suitable reference class is: **Metaculus questions where the CP is at/near the threshold with ~12 days remaining and a pending government decision expected within the resolution window.**

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

- The question resolves on **March 13, 2026** — just 11 days from now (March 2, 2026).
- The original Metaculus question resolves based on whether the UK increases the qualifying period **before May 1, 2026**.
- The consultation closed February 12, 2026. The government indicated April 2026 implementation.
- The Employment Law Worldview source suggests "Summer 2026" implementation is more likely, which would mean the policy does NOT take effect before May 2026.
- The BBC source says "spring 2026" rollout.
- The current CP of 55% reflects genuine uncertainty about whether the April 2026 timeline will be met.

Key question: In the next 11 days (March 2-13), will new information emerge that pushes the CP above 55%?

Possible catalysts:
- Official government announcement of implementation date
- Statement of Changes to immigration rules
- Parliamentary debate or announcement
- News reports clarifying the timeline

The CP has been sitting at 55% as of March 1. This is a very close call. The question is whether the CP will drift upward or downward in the next 11 days.

**(d) Justification:**

Key factors:

1. **Starting point**: CP is exactly 55.00% — right at the threshold. Any movement above resolves Yes; any movement at or below resolves No.

2. **Directional pressure**: The government has been signaling April 2026 implementation. If any official announcement or Statement of Changes is published before March 13, the CP would likely jump above 55%. However, the Employment Law Worldview source suggests Summer 2026 is more likely, which would push CP down.

3. **Information environment**: The consultation closed February 12, 2026. The government would need to publish a Statement of Changes to immigration rules to implement this. Such statements typically require parliamentary process. The 11-day window is short.

4. **Metaculus CP dynamics**: When a CP sits at exactly a threshold with ~11 days remaining, absent new information, it tends to stay near that level. The question is whether new information arrives.

5. **Base rate for CP movement**: For questions with ~11 days remaining where CP is at exactly 55%, the probability of moving above vs. below is roughly 50/50 absent directional information. However, the slight lean toward "government will announce" (given April target) vs. "implementation delayed" creates a modest upward bias.

6. **The meta-question structure**: This asks if CP > 55% (strictly greater), not ≥ 55%. So the CP must move at least slightly above current level.

7. **Recent news**: No sources from after March 1, 2026 are available. The CP has been at 55% as of March 1. Given the consultation ended February 12 and the government indicated April 2026 implementation, there's moderate probability of an announcement in March.

Outside view calibration:

The CP is at exactly 55.00% with 11 days to resolution. The question asks if it will be **strictly greater than** 55.00%.

Arguments for Yes (CP rises above 55%):
- Government indicated April 2026 implementation; an announcement in early March would push CP up
- Political pressure remains high (Gallup poll, Reform UK threat)
- Consultation has ended; next step is formal rule changes

Arguments for No (CP stays at or below 55%):
- Employment Law Worldview suggests Summer 2026 implementation
- Implementing such a major change by April 2026 is very tight (consultation only ended Feb 12)
- No evidence of imminent Statement of Changes
- The CP being at exactly 55% suggests the community is genuinely split

The slight lean: The government has been very vocal about April 2026, but the practical timeline is tight. The CP at 55% reflects this genuine uncertainty. In the next 11 days, I'd estimate roughly equal probability of the CP moving up vs. staying/moving down, with perhaps a slight edge toward staying near 55% or drifting slightly in either direction.

Given the CP must be **strictly greater than** 55.00% (not equal), and it's currently at exactly 55.00%, there's a slight disadvantage for Yes — the CP needs to move up, not just stay put.

I estimate approximately 45% probability that the CP will be strictly greater than 55% on March 13.

Outside View Prediction: 45%
