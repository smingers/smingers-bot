**Critical new fact from AskNews (Anadolu Ajansı, Mar 2, 2026):** The UK government announced on March 2, 2026 (today) that refugee status duration is reduced to 30 months, effective immediately. This is part of the broader reform package. The article notes the 20-year wait for permanent residence is "pending parliamentary vote" — suggesting the broader settlement reform hasn't been legislated yet.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- Multiple high-quality sources (Guardian, Lewis Silkin, FreeMovement, Erickson) confirm April 2026 as the government's stated implementation target for the 10-year settlement qualifying period. The consultation closed Feb 12, 2026. This is a strong directional signal that implementation is proceeding.
- The March 2, 2026 announcement of refugee status reduction to 30 months (Anadolu Ajansı) shows the government is actively implementing parts of the broader immigration reform package RIGHT NOW, suggesting momentum toward the April 2026 target.
- Home Secretary Mahmood explicitly stated in November 2025 Hansard that changes would come into effect "in April 2026" — a direct causal mechanism.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Political pressure from Reform UK polling at 28% and Labour's poor polling (net -49 approval) creates strong incentive for Labour to implement tough immigration policies quickly. This supports implementation proceeding.
- The consultation closing Feb 12 without apparent major government retreat suggests the policy direction is fixed.
- The smobserved.com article (lower quality) claims the government has already "doubled the wait" — if true, this would be decisive, but this appears to be describing the proposal, not a completed action.

**Weak evidence:**
- The Anadolu Ajansı article notes the 20-year refugee wait is "pending parliamentary vote" — this suggests at least some elements require parliamentary approval, which could delay the 10-year baseline.
- 265,000+ petition signatures opposing retroactive application (Connaught Law) — weak evidence of political resistance.
- Legal challenges anticipated (immigration lawyers) — weak evidence of delay.

**Key uncertainty:** The question asks whether the 10-year qualifying period will actually be IN EFFECT before May 1, 2026. The government has stated April 2026 as the target. The question is whether this will actually happen. The March 2 refugee status announcement shows active implementation of related policies, which is bullish for the April 2026 target.

**Impact on Metaculus community prediction:** If the community learns that:
1. The government is actively implementing immigration reforms (refugee status change, March 2)
2. The April 2026 target remains on track
3. No major obstacles have emerged

...then the community prediction could move upward from 55% toward 60-65%.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution date is March 13, 2026 — 11 days from now. The target question itself resolves based on whether the 10-year qualifying period is in effect before May 1, 2026.

**Current state:** The community prediction is at 55% as of March 1, 2026. The meta-question asks if it will be ABOVE 55% on March 13.

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days):** Less time for new information to emerge; prediction would be closer to status quo (55%). Probability of being above 55% would be slightly lower (~40%).

**If timeframe doubled (22 days):** More time for government announcements about April 2026 implementation; probability of being above 55% would be higher (~55%).

The 11-day window is short but not negligible. The March 2 refugee status announcement is fresh news that could prompt forecasters to update upward.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting from outside view base rate: 45%**

The outside view established ~45% probability that the community prediction would be strictly above 55% on March 13.

**Upward adjustments:**

1. **March 2, 2026 refugee status announcement (moderate-strong):** The UK government just announced (today) the reduction of refugee status to 30 months, effective immediately. This is part of the same reform package as the 10-year settlement qualifying period. This signals active implementation momentum and will likely prompt Metaculus forecasters to update upward on the probability of the 10-year baseline being implemented by April 2026. **+8 pp**

2. **Consultation closed Feb 12 with no government retreat (moderate):** The consultation closed without any signal from the government that it was abandoning or significantly modifying the 10-year baseline. Multiple specialist sources confirm April 2026 remains the target. **+5 pp**

3. **Strong political incentive for Labour (moderate):** Labour's catastrophic polling (net -49 approval) and Reform UK at 28% creates strong incentive to implement tough immigration policies. The government has shown willingness to act (refugee status change today). **+3 pp**

**Downward adjustments:**

1. **"Pending parliamentary vote" language (moderate):** The Anadolu Ajansı article notes the 20-year refugee wait is "pending parliamentary vote." If the 10-year baseline also requires parliamentary approval (rather than just a statement of changes to Immigration Rules), this could delay implementation. However, changes to Immigration Rules typically don't require primary legislation — they can be made by the Home Secretary. **-3 pp**

2. **Legal challenges and retroactive application concerns (weak):** Immigration lawyers have warned of legal challenges, and 265,000+ people have signed petitions. These could slow implementation. **-2 pp**

3. **Short timeframe for community to update (weak):** Only 11 days for forecasters to discover the March 2 announcement and update. Not all forecasters will be active. **-2 pp**

**Net adjustment:** +8 +5 +3 -3 -2 -2 = +9 pp

**Inside view prediction:** 45% + 9% = **54%**

However, I need to reconsider. The key question is: will the Metaculus COMMUNITY PREDICTION be above 55% on March 13? The community is currently AT 55%. For it to be above 55%, it needs to move up even slightly (to 55.01% or more).

The March 2 refugee status announcement is significant new information that is directly related to the broader immigration reform package. This will likely prompt some forecasters to update upward. The political momentum is clearly toward implementation. The April 2026 target remains on track.

The question is whether this is enough to push the community median from 55% to above 55%. Given:
- The community is already at 55% (showing genuine uncertainty)
- New bullish information (March 2 announcement) has just emerged
- The April 2026 implementation target remains credible
- Political incentives strongly favor implementation

I think the probability is slightly above 50% that the community will be above 55% on March 13.

**Final calibration: 52%**

---

**Probability Calibration:**

The outside view gave 45%. The inside view adjustments push this to approximately 52-54%. The key driver is the March 2, 2026 refugee status announcement showing active implementation of the broader reform package, which should prompt upward updates from Metaculus forecasters. However, the community is already at 55% (reflecting significant uncertainty), and the short timeframe limits how much movement is likely. I'll settle at **52%**.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will the Metaculus community prediction for "UK increases settlement qualifying period to 10 years before May 2026" be strictly above 55% on March 13, 2026?

2. **Outside view base rate:** 45% (symmetric ~50% adjusted down for news-scarcity and time-pressure drift). Inside view adjusts upward to ~52% due to March 2 refugee status announcement and implementation momentum.

3. **Consistency check:** "52 out of 100 times, the community prediction is above 55% on March 13, 2026." This makes sense given the community is currently at exactly 55% and new bullish information has just emerged.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - March 2, 2026: UK government announced refugee status reduced to 30 months (active implementation of reform package) ✓ Verified
   - Consultation closed Feb 12 with April 2026 target intact ✓ Verified
   - Home Secretary Mahmood stated April 2026 implementation in Hansard ✓ Verified
   - Labour's poor polling creates strong incentive for tough immigration action ✓ Verified
   - "Pending parliamentary vote" language for some elements suggests possible delays ✓ Verified

5. **Blind-spot:** If the government announces a delay or significant modification to the 10-year baseline in the next 11 days, the community prediction could drop well below 55%, making my ~52% look too high. This scenario is possible but unlikely given the March 2 momentum.

6. **Status quo:** The community is at 55%. Status quo would be no change (exactly 55%), which resolves this meta-question as "No." The slight upward momentum from March 2 news nudges toward "Yes."

Probability: 52%
