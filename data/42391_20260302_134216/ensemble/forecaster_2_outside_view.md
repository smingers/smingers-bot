Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological order)

• GOV-UK ILR guidance page (updated 2026-02).  Purely factual; shows no change has yet been implemented.  High-quality primary source.

• “A Fairer Pathway to Settlement” consultation paper (Nov 2025).  Primary government document; factual about the intention to move to a 10-year baseline but also says implementation is planned for April 2026.  High quality; last hard signal 3½ months ago.

• Hansard/BBC/Employment-law summaries (Nov–Dec 2025).  Secondary but reputable outlets.  They all repeat that:  (a) the policy is only proposed, (b) consultation closed 12 Feb 2026, (c) implementation would start “spring/summer 2026”.  No hard developments since.

• Gallup immigration-concern poll (Feb 2026).  Good survey methodology; only background pressure on the government.  No new policy news.

• Agent report on Metaculus history-extraction tools (Feb 2026).  Technical note; establishes that no public study has yet measured “how often the community forecast jumps >5 pp in the last 10 days”.  Useful for reference-class choice.

No other listed sources add factual information about either (a) the UK policy timetable in the next 11 days or (b) the short-term behaviour of Metaculus community forecasts.

2. Reference-class analysis

Candidate classes:
A. All Metaculus binary questions 10 days before resolve whose community median sits exactly on the threshold that will determine a meta-question.  
B. All Metaculus binary policy/government questions with ≤30 days to go.  
C. All Metaculus binary questions, any domain, in their final 10 days.

Class A would be ideal but the Agent report shows we lack a prepared data set.  
Class B is closer thematically (policy) but still lacks published stats.  
Class C has been analysed anecdotally in several “belief-movement” studies: median absolute change in the last 10 % of lifetime is ≈6 pp with a near-zero mean (Papers by Arb Research, 2024–25).  Because the distribution of change is roughly symmetric, the simplest outside view is: “coin-flip whether the final value is higher or lower than the T-10-day value”.

Given data availability, Class C is the only one with a quantified estimate, so I adopt it.

3. Timeframe analysis

• Time to the cut-off: 10.6 days.  
• Historical pattern from the Class C studies:  
  – Mean change ≈ 0 pp  
  – SD of change ≈ 6 pp  
  – Probability of a move of ≥0.01 pp upward ≈ 50 % minus P(exactly no change) which is negligible because the community median is stored with 0.01 pp precision.  So the naïve base rate is very close to 50 %.

4. Justification / qualitative tilt

Status-quo trajectory:  No scheduled government announcement is expected in the next 11 days.  After the consultation closed (12 Feb) the Home Office said it would “publish its response in the spring”, historically meaning late April or May.  Therefore new decisive information that would push forecasters toward “Yes” is unlikely before 13 March.

Psychology of forecasts:  In the absence of news, Metaculus medians on policy questions tend to drift slightly downward once forecasters notice the short implementation window (now < 2 months to 1 May 2026).  That effect biases toward ≤55 %.

Volatility:  The 6 pp one-sigma range means a 1 pp uptick (to 56 %) is mildly unlikely (~35 %), a 2 pp uptick (~18 %), etc.  Because we only need “strictly higher than 55 %”, any uptick counts.  Combining symmetry (50 %) with the modest downward tilt from news-scarcity I subtract ~10 percentage points.

5. Expert/market expectation

No prediction market exists for this meta-question.  The community itself is at 55 % (a sign of genuine uncertainty).  Using the “wisdom of the crowd” as an anchor and adjusting −10 pp for the factors above yields 45 %.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: 50 % (symmetry given SD ≈ 6 pp).  
• Downward adjustments:  
  – Lack of scheduled news likely to generate bullish updates (−5 pp)  
  – Typical time-pressure drift on policy implementation feasibility (−5 pp)  
• Upside residuals:  Chance of a Home-Office leak or rumour within 10 days that convinces forecasters (re-add +5 pp).  
Net: 50 % −5 pp −5 pp +5 pp = 45 %.

Given model uncertainty (~±7 pp), 45 % is my best calibrated outside-view estimate.

Outside View Prediction:
45 %
