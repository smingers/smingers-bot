Analysis:
**1) Paraphrase / what’s being forecast**
We resolve **Yes** iff the Metaculus community prediction (CP) for “UK increase settlement qualifying period to 10 years before May 2026?” is **strictly > 55.00%** at **2026-03-13 03:38:43**; otherwise **No**.

## (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; date)
**High/medium reliability; directly on “earned settlement / 10-year baseline”**
- **UK Government consultation (“A Fairer Pathway to Settlement / earned settlement”)** (primary document; Nov 2025–Feb 12, 2026 close): Confirms proposal architecture, incl. **10-year baseline** and modulating factors. *High reliability; but proposal ≠ implemented.*
- **The Guardian (Feb 20, 2026)**: Reports consultation closed; changes **could be in force by April 2026** and expected to apply retroactively; cites charities/advocates and policy detail (10-year baseline, 20-year penalties for public funds). *High-quality outlet; mixes facts + stakeholder opinions, but factual timeline reporting is usually solid.*
- **Lewis Silkin (Dec 24, 2025)** and **Erickson Immigration Group (Nov 25, 2025)** (immigration law firm/client advisory): Consultation closing date; “as early as April 2026” implementation; outlines mandatory pillars. *Generally reliable on process/timing, but still interpretive.*
- **Free Movement commentary (pre–Feb 12, 2026)**: Advocacy framing; confirms consultation and that 10-year baseline remains central in the documents. *Good for “policy still live,” weaker for probabilities.*
- **Connaught Law analysis (date unclear / advisory)**: Reiterates April 2026 intent, notes petitions and competitiveness concerns. *Useful context; less reliable as “news.”*

**Broader political pressure / salience (indirectly relevant)**
- **YouGov (ILR abolition polling; date not specified but recent)**: Public divided on ending ILR; strong opposition to stripping existing holders. *Good survey house; relevant to feasibility/retroactivity politics, not the exact 10-year change.*
- **AskNews: Anadolu Ajansı (Mar 2, 2026)**: Reports UK government **reduced refugee status duration to 30 months, effective immediately**, and references broader reforms (incl. longer waits for PR pending vote). *Not a UK domestic outlet, but a real wire service; if accurate, it’s a concrete demonstration government is executing hardline migration changes quickly.*
- **AskNews: Express / Independent / others (Feb 27–28, 2026)**: Political narratives about Labour pressure and Reform UK. *Some is opinion-heavy (Express); Independent is commentary; useful mainly as “pressure remains high,” not as dispositive facts.*
- **VisaHQ eVisa pieces (Feb 2026)**: Digital border operational changes. *Tangential; weak signal for settlement timeline.*

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted for this meta-question)
Reminder: we are not directly forecasting the policy; we’re forecasting **whether the Metaculus CP will be >55** by Mar 13.

**Strong evidence (moves me upward)**
1. **Concrete implementation behavior**: Anadolu report (Mar 2) that government enacted a significant asylum-status tightening **effective immediately**. If true, it’s a strong institutional signal that (i) hardline reforms are being operationalized quickly and (ii) Home Office can move fast via rule/administrative changes. This tends to push the *underlying* event probability upward and should nudge Metaculus forecasters upward too—especially because CP is perched exactly at 55.

**Moderate evidence (slight upward)**
2. **Multiple reputable/process-informed sources still pointing to April 2026**: Guardian + law-firm advisories continue to treat **April 2026** as plausible for rule changes; consultation closed Feb 12, so the next step is “statement of changes.” This sustains a >50% underlying chance and supports small CP increases if forecasters were previously worried about slippage.
3. **Political pressure remains acute** (polling concern, Reform UK salience): This increases incentives to deliver visible tightening on schedule, which Metaculus participants may interpret as raising odds.

**Weak / ambiguous evidence (small, two-sided)**
4. **Implementation complexity / legal challenge risk** (various commentary): could push some forecasters down, but this is mostly “known already” and likely incorporated into the existing 55%.

**Meta-dynamics point (important):**
- Because the CP is **exactly 55.00%**, even a modest influx of “government is acting quickly” sentiment can move the weighted median **above** 55. The strict “>55” threshold makes “no change” and “round-number stickiness” matter, but a single salient news cycle can break it.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: **11 days** (Mar 2 → Mar 13).
- In such a short window, the CP is most likely to move due to **news shocks** or **forecaster attention**, not slow accumulation.
- If the timeframe were **halved (~5–6 days)**: I’d expect less chance of movement; more probability mass on “stays at 55.00,” so my Yes probability would drop a bit.
- If the timeframe were **doubled (~22 days)**: more chances for additional headlines (government speeches, draft rules chatter, leaks), so more opportunity for CP to drift away from 55; given current direction of pressure, I’d expect a slightly higher chance of exceeding 55 than in the 11-day window.

## (d) Justification: how this shifts the outside view
**Outside view base rate provided:** 45% that CP will be >55 on Mar 13.

**Key update since that base rate:** the Mar 2 report of an immediate, real policy tightening on refugee status duration (30 months renewable). Even allowing for some uncertainty in that reporting, the “government executing tough migration reforms now” is the kind of concrete signal that tends to:
1) increase the underlying probability of further near-term tightening (including earned settlement rules), and
2) attract forecaster updates (particularly because the Metaculus question is high-salience and already near a knife-edge).

**Status quo if nothing changes in the information environment:** CP likely stays near 55 and could resolve **No** via “≤55.” But the new Mar 2 development makes “nothing changes” less likely; it supplies a plausible catalyst for small upward movement.

Net: I shift from 45% to modestly above 50%, mainly because (i) the threshold is extremely local (just needs to be 55.01+), and (ii) the latest concrete-hardline-action news is directionally aligned with “Yes on the underlying policy,” hence “CP ticks up.”

Probability calibration
- My inside-view estimate that CP is **strictly above 55** on Mar 13 is **58%**.
- This implies: more often than not, we see at least a small upward nudge (even +0.2 to +1.0) from the current 55.00; but there remains substantial risk the median is sticky or a countervailing “implementation delayed” narrative appears, keeping it at/under 55.

Checklist:
1) **Paraphrase:** Yes iff Metaculus CP for the target question is **>55.00%** at **2026-03-13 03:38:43** (or mirrors early resolution).  
2) **Outside view base rate:** 45%.  
3) **Consistency check:** 58 out of 100 times, the target question’s CP is **above** 55% at the snapshot time.  
4) **Top evidence (≤20 words each):**
   - Mar 2: reported immediate refugee-status tightening suggests Home Office can execute major reforms quickly.
   - Guardian + law-firm advisories still treat April 2026 implementation as plausible after Feb 12 consultation close.
   - Threshold is knife-edge: only a tiny CP increase is needed for “Yes.”  
5) **Blind spot:** CP could remain exactly 55.00 (median stickiness / low attention) or drop on credible “delay” reporting.  
6) **Status quo nudge:** Without new info, CP hovering at 55 implies “No” via ≤55; I adjusted upward due to Mar 2 catalyst.

Probability: 58%
