**Evaluating CP Predictions**

I’m looking to predict whether the CP will exceed 55% on March 13 when the current CP is 55.00. My approach is considering general behaviors of community predictions and mean reversion. While I lack specific data, I think general heuristics can guide me. If we assume symmetrical noise around 55.00, the probability of exceeding it is about 50%, but rounding and ties complicate it. I expect some minor fluctuation in either direction as new forecasts emerge.**Analyzing Policy Implementation Timing**

I’m considering the impact of upcoming policy changes scheduled for April 2026 on the CP, especially since consultation wrapped up in February. Given that key announcements could happen in the next 11 days, I wonder if I should focus on general trends instead of specific details. By looking at the base rates of CP changes over the last two weeks, I estimate the likelihood of exceeding 55% is around 50%, though distributions may vary based on longer-term trends. There’s potential for slight drift around the current level of 55.**Considering Policy Implementation and CP Movement**

I see there might be a downward drift in the CP as the implementation deadline before May 2026 approaches. If no legislation is in place by March 2026, the community might anticipate a decline. While that leans toward an inside view, the outside view suggests staying with the status quo; major rule changes in the UK can be executed through quick Immigration Rules amendments. The CP being at 55 indicates a slight leaning toward a positive outcome. I need to analyze source information regarding the policy proposal and review similar metaculus meta-questions for context.**Analyzing CP Fluctuations**

I’m looking at the random fluctuations of the CP around its current value over a short timeframe of 11 days. In this period, unless there’s major news, I think the CP will likely remain stable. However, the activity of forecasters might lead to small movements. Since the CP starts at the threshold of 55, it suggests a near 50/50 probability. Adjusting for minor trends or mean reversion, I estimate the probability might dip slightly below 50%. I’ll choose a precise percentage, like 47.3%, to reflect this.**Calculating CP Change Probability**

I'm trying to reason through the probability of CP changes over 11 days, assuming a normal distribution. If I set the mean change (μ) to -1 percentage points and the standard deviation (σ) to 3, the probability of an increase (P(Δ>0)) is about 37%, which feels too low. Adjusting μ to -0.5 gives a probability of 40%, while μ at 0 hits 50%. Considering that slight downward drift is likely, I’m estimating around 43% with adjustments for negative trends. I'll ensure to mention the lack of tethering and calibrate the baseline to 50% with a -7pp adjustment.
