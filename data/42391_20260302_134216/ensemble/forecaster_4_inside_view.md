Analysis:
1. Paraphrased resolution: On 13 Mar 2026 (≈03:38 UTC) the Metaculus community prediction for “UK settlement period to 10 yrs before May 2026” must be strictly > 55.00 %. If so → Yes; otherwise → No.

(a) Source analysis (quality & fact/opinion):
• Home-Office consultation paper, 25 Nov 2025 (primary, factual). – Confirms plan, April 2026 target.  
• Hansard answer, 20 Nov 2025 (primary, factual). – Same timeline.  
• Immigration-law firm notes (Lewis Silkin 24 Dec 2025; Erickson IG 25 Nov 2025) (expert commentary, moderately reliable). – Explain rules likely published mid-March.  
• Guardian 20 Feb 2026, VisaHQ 11 Feb 2026, Free-Movement 12 Feb 2026 (mainstream / specialist press, factual reporting + advocacy). – Confirm consultation closed, no u-turn.  
• Parliament-matters bulletin 02 Mar 2026 (procedural schedule, factual). – Lists “social-security immigration” SIs week of 8 Mar.  
• AskNews polling bundle (Ipsos, Gallup, YouGov Feb 2026—high-quality polls) – Shows strong public pressure for tougher immigration.  
• Anadolu 02 Mar 2026 – Refugee-status cut to 30 months (mainstream wire). – Shows government still tightening immigration.  
No source in the last week hints the plan is dropped; none shows final rules already laid.

(b) Evidence weighting for CP movement (next 11 days):
Strong evidence
• Historical Home-Office practice: Spring Statement-of-Changes usually published in week 2-3 of March (2019–25). – Structural, hard to change.  ↑
• Consultation closed 12 Feb 2026; tight April go-live implies rules must appear soon. ↑
Moderate evidence
• Parliamentary bulletin flags immigration SIs w/c 8 Mar 2026. ↑
• High public salience / political incentive to look decisive before May local elections. ↑
• Metaculus CPs for policy-implementation questions often drift downward as deadlines loom if no confirming news (observed in 2024–25 data sample by author). ↓
Weak evidence
• Advocacy pieces predicting legal challenges / ministerial angst – speculative. ↓
• Generic poll noise influencing forecasters’ sentiment – volatile. (±)

Net evidence tilt: Slightly positive news momentum but balanced by usual pre-deadline scepticism.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Remaining time: 11 days.  If halved (5 days) very unlikely rules are released → probability of > 55 % would fall ~5 pts.  If doubled (22 days) odds would rise ~7 pts because probability of policy confirmation before 25 Mar grows.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (derived earlier): 43 %.  
Adjustments:
+5 pts Strong chance of a Home-Office “Statement of Changes” between 8–12 Mar (historical pattern + bulletin cue).  
+1 pt Political pressure / steady drum-beat of tougher measures (Anadolu refugee change 2 Mar) increases likelihood CP nudges upward even on rumours.  
−4 pts Strict “> 55.00 %” rule (ties lose) and natural downward mean-reversion when no document appears.  

Inside-view = 43 % +5 % +1 % −4 % ≈ 45 %.

Scenario reasoning
A) Rules published or credible leak by 13 Mar (≈35 % chance) → CP likely 60 – 70 %; contributes 0.35 × 0.85 ≈ 30 pts.  
B) No confirmation (≈65 %) → CP drifts to 52–54 %; contributes 0.65 × 0.25 ≈ 16 pts.  Sum ≈ 46 %.  Rounded to 45 % for clarity.

Checklist:
1. Title paraphrased above – yes.  
2. Outside view 43 %.  Final 45 % anchored.  
3. Consistency: “45 out of 100 times the CP will finish > 55 % on 13 Mar 2026.” – plausible.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Spring Immigration Rule changes historically land mid-March.  
   • Consultation closed 12 Feb; April go-live requires imminent action.  
   • Parliamentary schedule lists immigration SIs for w/c 8 Mar.  
   • No sign of government retreat; additional hard-line moves reported 2 Mar.  
   • Metaculus CPs often sag without hard news near deadlines.  
5. Blind-spot: Home Office delays publication to late-March yet credible “sources” leak draft this week, spiking CP to >65 % (probability understated).  
6. Status-quo pull: If no concrete news by 11 Mar, forecasters may knock CP down a couple of points; I incorporated this in 55 : 45 weighting.

Probability calibration
Given available information and 11-day horizon, I estimate a 45 % chance that the community prediction exceeds 55 % at the specified timestamp.

Probability: 45%
