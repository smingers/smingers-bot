Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. UK Home Office “Earned Settlement” consultation paper (Nov-2025, primary). Factual: government intent to raise baseline to 10 years, target implementation April-2026. High reliability.  
2. Lewis Silkin & Erickson Immigration Group client notes (Dec-2025 & Nov-2025). Professional legal commentary echoing the same timetable; no sign of slippage. Moderately reliable, dated.  
3. Guardian, VisaHQ, Free-Movement, Praxis survey pieces (Feb-2026). Journalistic/advocacy reports confirming the consultation closed 12 Feb-2026 and that the 10-year baseline is still “proposed”. Reliable for dates, opinionated about impact.  
4. Hansard bulletin (2 Mar-2026). Lists forthcoming parliamentary business; no settlement S.I. scheduled before 13 Mar. Primary source, weak negative signal.  
5. AskNews polling round-ups (Feb-2026). Multiple reputable polls (Ipsos, YouGov, Gallup). Show very high public salience of immigration but give no concrete policy dates.  
6. Metaculus data (implicit). Community forecast currently exactly 55 % on 2 Mar. Historical studies (Arb 2025) find σ≈6 pp for 10-day window. Technical, good quality.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• No official decision published; parliamentary schedule shows nothing imminent → odds favour no decisive pro-10-year news before 13 Mar (downward).  
Moderate:  
• Government’s April-2026 target still on record → some chance of a leak or ministerial statement in next 10 days (upward).  
• Historical Metaculus volatility (σ≈6 pp, mean 0) → base rate 50 % that the median ends higher than today.  
Weak:  
• High public anti-immigration sentiment could bias forecasters but effect size unclear.  
• Advocacy articles predicting hardship may nudge a few bearish updates.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time to cut-off: 10.5 days.  
If the window were halved to 5 days, expected σ would fall (~4 pp) and probability of any uptick above 55 % would drop to ~40 %.  
If doubled to 21 days, σ≈8.5 pp; chance of an upward move would rise toward 48–49 % because more time for news.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate: 45 %.  
Adjustments:  
–1 pp: last-minute drift on policy questions typically negative when practical obstacles become salient.  
–2 pp: explicit absence of settlement regulations in next week’s parliamentary agenda.  
+2 pp: non-trivial chance (≈10 %) of Home Office leak or minister media round raising perceived likelihood.  
Net = 44 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that 44 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction will be strictly above 55 % on 13 Mar 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Restatement: Will Metaculus median for UK 10-year settlement question exceed 55 % on 13 Mar 2026?  
2. Base rate used: 45 %.  
3. Consistency line: “44 out of 100 times, the criterion is met.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   • No parliamentary slot for rule change before 13 Mar (down).  
   • Consultation closed, decision still pending (neutral⇢down).  
   • Historical 10-day σ≈6 pp, symmetric (base 50 %).  
   • Occasional Home Office leaks move forecasts >5 pp (up).  
5. Blind-spot: sudden authoritative scoop (e.g., FT leak of Cabinet sign-off) on 8–12 Mar could spike forecast above 60 %.  
6. Status-quo tilt: without news, slight downward drift is typical, favouring ≤55 %.

Probability: 44%
