**Analyzing forecast probabilities**

I need to prepare a professional forecasting response with sections like Analysis, Probability calibration, and a checklist. Starting with a base rate of 45% for the outside view, I’ll compare it to existing sources I've summarized. The time window is 10.5 days until March 13, 2026. I'm wondering if the community's prediction will exceed 55% then. Right now, it sits at exactly 55%. It's crucial to consider a slight downward trend due to the deadline approach and low news frequency. My estimate of the probability is around 40-45%.**Calculating and analyzing probabilities**

I'm focusing on establishing probabilities, starting with a 50% baseline minus the probability of no change, which I estimate at around 8%. This brings my probability of change to about 46%. However, I anticipate a downward drift of roughly 1 percentage point in the last 10 days. After calculations, I find that the probability may rest around 44%. 

I’ll structure the analysis with sections covering source analysis, evidence analysis, timeframe analysis, and justification to support that 44% figure.
