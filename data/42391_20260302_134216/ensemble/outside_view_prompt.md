You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 55.00% on 2026-03-13 for the Metaculus question "Will the UK increase the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years before May 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/42135
- Original question title: Will the UK increase the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years before May 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-03-01: 55.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before May 1, 2026, the baseline qualifying period for settlement (permanent residency) in the UK is 10 or more years.

Original fine print: 
> To qualify a change must affect at least some applicants for permanent residency before May 2026. If a change is announced, but does not come in to effect before May 1, 2026, it will not be sufficient to resolve this question.
> 
> This question will not consider any modifications that change the residency requirement; only the baseline requirement will matter for this question.
> 
> If the baseline requirement is increased for some visa categories but not others, this question will resolve according to how the new baseline would have applied to the majority of grants in [the year ending September 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-september-2025/how-many-indefinite-leave-settlement-and-euss-settled-status-and-citizenship-grants-have-been-issued-in-the-uk#s-2).

Original background: 
> Immigrants to the UK can currently apply for permanent residency – or "indefinite leave to remain" – after living in the country [for 5 years under most visa categories](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain#:~:text=You%20must%20usually%20have%20lived%20and%20worked%20in%20the%20UK%20for%205%20years).

> 
> In November 2025, Mahmood indicated that the changes would come into effect [in April 2026.](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-11-20/debates/E3CE324D-7597-40C5-8697-DB48AA843CFC/MigrationSettlementPathway#contribution-44475956-0A57-466A-A4EA-7A7FD64AAD83)

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/42135) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-03-13 03:38:43 is higher than 55.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 55.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-03-13 03:38:43, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

## Summary of UK Immigration Settlement Statistics (Year Ending September 2025)

### Key Statistics on Settlement Grants

**Overall Indefinite Leave Grants:**
- Total of **491,453 grants of indefinite leave** in the year ending September 2025
- 67% (330,745) were EUSS settled status grants
- 32% (158,137) were settlement grants under other immigration routes
- Remaining <1% were "immediate settlement" grants

**Settlement (ILE/ILR) Trends:**
- 158,137 total settlement grants — a **6% increase** from the previous year
- Settlement grants have followed an **upward trajectory since 2018**

**Breakdown by Category:**
- **Work-related:** 59,642 grants (+11%), with Skilled Worker route comprising ~75% of these
- **Family-related:** 43,942 grants (+5%), mostly to former Partner visa holders
- **Refugee/protection:** 35,725 grants (slight -2% decrease, but still double 2019 volumes)
- **Other (Long Residence, Private Life, etc.):** 18,828 grants (+15%)

### EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)
- 330,745 settled status grants in the latest year (down 5%)
- Since scheme launch, **4.3 million settled status grants** total
- ~1.5 million people still hold pre-settled status as of September 2025
- From January 2025, some pre-settled status holders can receive **automated settled status grants** without applying; ~53,750 have received this so far

### Citizenship
- **240,613 British citizenship grants** in the latest year (-10% from previous year)
- Still higher than any of the preceding 13 years
- 171,859 grants through naturalisation (nearly double recent historical norms)

### Policy Context Noted in Article
- The Home Office opened a **public consultation ("A Fairer Pathway to Settlement")** in November 2025, proposing to reform settlement rules, open for a 12-week period
- Current qualifying period is **5 years** under most work or family routes; **10 years** under the long residence route

*Note: The article is a statistical release and does not provide details on the outcome or timeline of the proposed policy changes beyond noting the consultation was opened.*

## Summary of GOV.UK: "Check if you can get indefinite leave to remain"

**Note:** This appears to be the current (as of retrieval) official GOV.UK guidance page on Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). It does not appear to reflect any proposed changes to the qualifying period.

### Key Facts from the Article:

**Current Qualifying Periods:**
- **Standard work visas:** Must have lived and worked in the UK for **5 years**
- **Tier 1 visa:** Can be **2 or 3 years**
- **Innovator Founder or Global Talent visa:** Can be **3 years**
- **UK Ancestry visa:** **5 years**
- **British National (Overseas) visa:** **5 years**
- **Long residence route:** **10 years or more** of living in the UK (this route already exists as a separate pathway)

### Relevance to the Forecasting Question:
This page reflects the **current rules** — the standard baseline qualifying period remains at **5 years** for most visa categories. There is **no indication on this page** that the proposed change to a 10-year baseline has been implemented. The 10-year period mentioned refers only to the existing long-residence route, not the standard settlement pathway.

This suggests that, as of the page's current state, the policy change has **not yet come into effect**.

## Summary: "A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" – UK Government Consultation (November 2025)

### Core Proposal
The UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced and is consulting on an **"earned settlement" model** that would increase the baseline qualifying period for permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain) from **5 years to 10 years**. The government states this change has already been announced and the consultation concerns the conditions under which settlement can be earned.

### Key Facts & Statistics
- **Net migration 2021–2024**: approximately 2.6 million people (roughly 1 in 30 current UK residents)
- **Health and Care visa arrivals 2022–2024**: ~616,000 individuals, over half being dependants
- **Forecast settlement grants 2026–2030**: ~1.6 million people, peaking at ~450,000 annually in 2028
- **21% of British people** (Gallup poll) consider immigration Britain's "biggest national problem"
- The Home Secretary indicated in November 2025 that changes would come into effect **in April 2026**

### Proposed Changes
1. **Baseline qualifying period**: Increased from 5 to **10 years**
2. **15-year qualifying period**: For Skilled Workers in roles below RQF Level 6 (below bachelor's degree level), and separately proposed for Health and Care visa migrants on lower wages
3. **Mandatory requirements** (non-negotiable):
   - Clean criminal record
   - High standard of English
   - Sustained economic contribution
   - No debt in the UK
4. **Time adjustment model**: Contributions can **reduce** the 10-year baseline (e.g., high-talent/high-taxpayer status, senior public service roles, extensive volunteering)
5. **Time penalties** for those claiming benefits or entering illegally
6. **Retroactive application**: Proposed to apply to **all current residents** who have not yet received settled status

### Notable Exemptions
- Those **already holding settled status** are unaffected
- **EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)** holders are out of scope
- **Windrush Scheme** grants are out of scope
- **Faster pathways** retained for spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong

### Consultation Scope
- Open for **12 weeks**
- Seeks views on children's pathways, armed forces members, crime victims, and whether benefits should be reserved for British citizens rather than those with settled status

### Source Reliability
This is a **primary government document** (Command Paper CP 1448), presented to Parliament by the Home Secretary — high reliability.

## Summary: "A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" – UK Government Consultation (November 2025)

### Core Proposal
The UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced and is consulting on an **"earned settlement" model** that would increase the baseline qualifying period for permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain) from **5 years to 10 years**. The government states this change has already been announced and frames the consultation as determining the conditions under which settlement can be earned.

### Key Proposed Changes

**Baseline Requirements (non-negotiable):**
- Clean criminal record (full "root and branch review" of criminality thresholds planned)
- High standard of English
- Sustained and measurable economic contribution
- No outstanding debt in the UK

**Time Adjustment Model (accelerating or delaying the 10-year baseline):**
- *Earlier settlement* possible for: high-talent/high-taxpaying individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers, and spouses/dependants of British citizens (not subject to consultation)
- *Delayed settlement* for: those who have claimed benefits, or those who entered the country illegally

**Special Categories:**
- A **15-year baseline** is proposed for lower-skilled/lower-wage migrants (specifically those on Health and Care visas below RQF level 6)
- A **20-year settlement path** already announced for refugees on "core protection" support
- Children, armed forces members, and crime victims are flagged as cohorts requiring special consideration

### Retroactive Application
Critically, the government proposes applying these new rules to **everyone currently in the UK who has not yet received settled status**, meaning those approaching their current 5-year qualifying date would be subject to the new requirements once immigration rules change.

### Exclusions
- Those who already hold settled status are **not affected**
- EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) holders are **out of scope**
- Windrush Scheme grants are **out of scope**

### Driving Factors
- Forecast of ~**1.6 million settlement grants between 2026–2030**, peaking at ~450,000 in 2028
- Net migration of **2.6 million people between 2021–2024**
- Fiscal concerns about migrants' public service usage vs. tax contributions
- A Gallup poll cited showing **21% of British people** consider immigration the country's biggest national problem

### Timeline
- The consultation runs for **12 weeks** from November 2025
- The Home Secretary indicated in Parliament (November 2025) that changes would come into effect in **April 2026**

### Rights Under Settlement (Consultation Question)
The document also raises whether **benefits access** should be restricted to British citizens only, rather than those with settled status.

<QuestionSource url="https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx">
## Summary: U.K. Leads World in Concern About Migration (Gallup, February 11, 2026)

### Key Statistics

- **21% of Britons** named immigration as their No. 1 national concern in 2025, statistically tied with the economy (23%)
- This makes the UK **the most likely country in the world** to cite immigration as the top national problem, compared to a global median of just **1%** across 107 countries
- UK net migration fell sharply: **204,000** in the year ending June 2025, down from nearly **650,000** in the year ending June 2024
- The UK has **17% foreign-born residents** — similar to the US (15%), Norway (18%), and Netherlands (16%) — yet those countries show far lower immigration concern

### Political Breakdown (Named Source: Gallup)

- **48% of Reform UK supporters** cite immigration as the biggest national problem — roughly twice the percentage of any other major European party's supporters
- **23% of Conservative supporters** and **16% of Labour supporters** share this concern
- **25% of politically unaligned Britons** name immigration as the top issue — roughly twice the next highest (Poland and Ireland at 13%)
- Labour, Conservative supporters, and nonpartisans still rank **economic issues above immigration**

### Key Predictors of Immigration Concern (Gallup Analysis)

Gallup identified five key predictors after controlling for demographic variables (specific predictors listed but not enumerated in the article text). Notably, **gender, employment status, urban/rural location, personal wellbeing, and actual household income** showed **no statistically significant relationship** with immigration concern.

### Historical Acceptance vs. Current Concern

- Between 2016–2023, UK acceptance of migrants **grew gradually**: by 2023, **80%** viewed immigrants as a good thing, **79%** were comfortable with an immigrant neighbor, and **75%** accepted an immigrant marrying a close relative
- This suggests concern about immigration as a **policy/systemic issue** can coexist with personal acceptance of individual migrants

### Political Implications

- Reform UK, despite holding few parliamentary seats, has been "setting the political weather" and attracting Conservative defections
- The findings highlight the **balancing act for PM Keir Starmer**, particularly ahead of local elections where immigration-focused voters could increase headwinds for the government

*This article is directly cited in the background of the target Metaculus question and provides context for the political pressure driving the proposed UK settlement qualifying period change.*

## Summary

**Disclaimer:** This article is entirely unrelated to the target question about UK settlement qualifying periods. It is a 2022 EA Forum post discussing shifts in the Metaculus community prediction for AGI arrival timelines. It contains **no relevant information** about UK immigration policy, settlement requirements, or the specific Metaculus question regarding the UK's potential increase of the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years.

---

### Article Content (for completeness):

The post notes that as of April 2022, the Metaculus community prediction for when the first AGI would become publicly known shifted to **2036**, representing a 6-year acceleration from prior estimates. The author attributes this shift potentially to recent AI papers (likely referencing PaLM or similar) generating attention and new forecasters joining the question.

Key observations from the post:
- The AGI prediction had previously been as early as **2032 (August 2020)** and as late as **2047 (October 2021)**, highlighting significant volatility
- The forecaster count grew ~20% in a short period, raising questions about **composition bias** vs. genuine belief updates
- The author is uncertain whether the shift reflects thoughtful updating or crowd-following behavior driven by hype

**This article provides no useful information for forecasting the target question about UK immigration settlement policy.**

<Summary source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_leave_to_remain">
## Summary of Article

**Disclaimer:** This article appears to be a general reference/Wikipedia-style overview of Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) rules in the UK, likely predating the proposed 2026 reforms. It does not directly address the proposed change to increase the qualifying period to 10 years.

### Key Facts About Current ILR Qualifying Periods

The article outlines various existing qualifying periods for ILR (settlement/permanent residency) in the UK:

- **2 years**: Spouses/partners of British citizens who arrived before 8 July 2012
- **4 years**: Holders of pre-April 2006 HSMP visas; Commonwealth Armed Forces veterans (4 years service)
- **5 years**: Standard qualifying period for most visa categories (Work/Family routes, spouses arriving after 9 July 2012, humanitarian protection)
- **10 years**: "Long residence" route for continuous lawful residence (with absence limits of no more than 540 days total or 180 days at one time)
- **7–10 years**: Children under 18 with 7 years residence can apply for leave to remain; ILR after 10 years
- **19–30+ years**: Private life grounds for older applicants

### Other Notable Points
- ILR holders pay **home student rates** for higher education
- ILR can **lapse** after 2+ continuous years outside the UK
- ILR holders can apply for **British citizenship** after holding ILR for 12+ months, with 5 years ordinary residence

The article does **not** reference the proposed reform to increase the baseline qualifying period to 10 years under the Mahmood proposals.

## Summary: UK Plans to Extend Settlement Qualifying Period to 10 Years

**Source:** BBC, November 20, 2025

### Core Announcement
Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced plans to extend the qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR/settlement) from **5 to 10 years**, affecting an estimated **2.6 million migrants** who arrived since 2021. Those already holding settlement status would not be affected.

### Tiered Waiting Periods
The proposed system introduces variable timelines based on circumstances:
- **3 years**: High earners (£125,140+ in prior 3 years)
- **5 years**: Doctors/NHS nurses; earners above £50,270
- **10 years**: New baseline standard
- **15 years**: Migrants claiming benefits for under 12 months; health and social care visa holders
- **20 years**: Migrants reliant on benefits for more than 12 months

### Key Conditions & Modifiers
- A-level standard English required
- Clean criminal record
- Minimum earnings of £12,570/year for at least 3 years
- Volunteering and English competency can reduce wait times
- Family members **do not** gain automatic status alongside the main applicant

### Implementation Timeline
- Consultation period ends **February 12, 2026**
- Rollout planned from **spring 2026**

### Political Reactions
- **Conservatives**: Supportive but warned of potential loopholes; urged a migration cap
- **Unison (public service union)**: Called changes "devastating" to essential workers, warning care services could collapse

## Summary: UK Settlement Policy Overhaul – Employment Law Worldview (December 8, 2025)

**Author:** Carine Elliott | **Source:** Employment Law Worldview

### Core Proposal
The UK Government's Command Paper (*A Fairer Pathway to Settlement*) proposes replacing the current 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) with a **merit-based, 10-year baseline qualifying period**. The system would be tiered:
- **Shorter periods** for high earners, key public service workers, or those demonstrating "exceptional integration"
- **Longer periods** (up to 20–30 years) for those with immigration breaches or heavy reliance on public funds
- Eligibility assessed against **four pillars** (not fully detailed in the article)

### Timeline Indicated
- Consultation closes: **February 12, 2026**
- Statement of Changes expected: **Spring 2026**
- Implementation likely: **Summer 2026 onwards**
- Current ILR rules remain in place until then

### Key Uncertainties
The article highlights significant gaps around **transitional arrangements**, including:
- Whether existing visa holders can settle under current (5-year) rules
- Whether new integration/contribution requirements apply retroactively
- Impact on sponsorship costs and workforce stability

### Employer Implications
- Increased sponsorship costs and administrative complexity over a decade-long tracking period
- Heightened retention challenges, particularly in healthcare, technology, and hospitality
- Need for proactive employee communication to manage anxiety among sponsored workers currently expecting 5-year settlement

### Notable Framing
The article is written from an **HR/employer advisory perspective**, urging businesses to participate in the consultation to influence transitional provisions.

<Agent_report>
Query: For Metaculus binary policy questions, collect community prediction 14 days pre-resolve vs on resolve; % crossing 55 % threshold upward
The material returned by the searches confirms four separate facts that are directly relevant to the original task but it also shows that a decisive part of the information we need is still missing.

1.  Time-series data on the Metaculus “community prediction” do exist and can be programmatically downloaded.  
    •  Both the open-source Ergo library (ergo.ought.org – “prediction_timeseries” attribute) and the newer Forecasting-Tools package (github.com/Metaculus/forecasting-tools) expose the full timestamped history of the community forecast for every question, including binary policy questions.  
    •  The Metaculus public API used by those libraries delivers records that include the community median at roughly one-hour granularity from question launch to resolution.

2.  Prior published analyses demonstrate that the history field is sufficiently clean for statistical work, but none of the papers/posts surveyed extract the exact metric we need.  
    •  Arb Research / EA Forum posts (zeL52MFB2Pkq9Kdme; JN6wm6u5MMmqwdnEs) and Metaculus’s own “Exploring AI track record” post apply bulk downloading of prediction histories to compute Brier scores, calibration curves, and belief-movement metrics; therefore the method we need (pull T-14-days snapshot and final snapshot) is technically feasible.  
    •  However, none of those studies look at “binary policy questions”, at the “14-day pre-resolve” cut-off, or at the “crossing of a 55 % threshold”. All aggregate either the full lifetime (“evaluated at all times”) or the “50 %, 25 %, 10 % time-remaining” milestones.

3.  No public dataset or published table already lists, for the subset “policy, binary”, the community probabilities 14 days before resolution and at resolution.  
    •  The Metaculus Benchmark and the Future-as-Label RL work (arxiv.org/2601.06336; emergentmind.com topics) focus on all domains or on AI questions, but do not provide the two-point comparison we need.  
    •  The EA Forum pieces supply large CSV/Sheets dumps, yet manual inspection of those sheets (linked in the posts) shows only a single “publish-midpoint-close” sample, not the precise −14 day mark.

4.  Consequently, we cannot yet compute the required statistic:  
       “% of Metaculus binary policy questions whose community prediction was ≤ 55 % exactly 14 days before resolution but finished > 55 % at resolution.”

Gaps that remain
A.  A precise list of “binary policy questions”.  The Metaculus taxonomy includes “Policy & Governance”, “Politics”, “Regulation”, etc., but neither the posts nor the benchmark explicitly tag a subset as “policy”.  
B.  For each of those questions, two exact numbers are still needed:  
        •  community_prediction(t = resolve_time − 14 days)  
        •  community_prediction(t = resolve_time)  
C.  Once those are available, we must perform a simple indicator test (crossing from ≤ 0.55 to > 0.55) and then compute the proportion across the universe.

What the current sources give us
•  Code to download and parse the necessary time series (Ergo, Forecasting-Tools).  
•  Examples proving that the resolution timestamp is included in the API feed (because the above studies draw Brier scores exactly at resolution).  
•  Empirical confirmation that Metaculus community medians do sometimes move materially in the final days (e.g., “belief movement” metrics in zeL52M… show median absolute change >10 % in the last 10 % of lifetime for many questions). That makes the crossing analysis non-trivial and worth computing.

Why we still need additional data
The original query demands a quantitative answer (“collect … % crossing 55 % threshold upward”). None of the returned literature or tools supplies that table out-of-the-box, and none of the authors reports that percentage. The data must therefore be drawn directly from the API and processed.

Summary
•  The infrastructure and precedent for extracting community-prediction histories are well documented (Ergo library, Forecasting-Tools).  
•  No published analysis to date has extracted the exact 14-days-pre-resolve snapshot for the subset “binary policy questions”.  
•  Therefore, to answer the forecasting meta-question (how often does the crowd cross upward past 55 % in the last two weeks?) we still need to:  
     1.  Compile the relevant question list (binary + policy).

## Summary

**Disclaimer:** This article is largely irrelevant to the question about UK settlement qualifying periods. It is a podcast episode description from *The Cognitive Revolution* featuring Deger Turan, CEO of Metaculus, discussing AI-powered forecasting — not UK immigration policy.

### Key Points from the Article:

- The episode features Nathan (host) and **Deger Turan, CEO of Metaculus**, discussing AI-powered forecasting and prediction markets.
- Topics covered include: how AI is "revolutionizing prediction markets," the potential for AI to **outperform human forecasters**, and Metaculus's **AI forecasting benchmark tournament**.
- Metaculus launched a **bot forecasting tournament** (linked in the description).
- The broader theme is the future of **collective intelligence and decision-making**.
- Additional podcast promotions are included (unrelated to forecasting or UK immigration).

### Relevance to the Target Question:
**None.** This article contains no information about UK immigration policy, the qualifying period for settlement, or the Metaculus community prediction on question #42135. It is a general promotional description of a podcast episode about AI forecasting capabilities and Metaculus as a platform.

## Summary of Article: Metaculus AI Benchmarking Series Q1 2025 Results

This article presents results from Metaculus's third quarterly AI Benchmarking Series tournament (Q1 2025), comparing AI bot forecasters against human "Pro Forecasters."

### Key Findings

**Human vs. Bot Performance:**
- Pro forecasters (team of 10) significantly outperformed the top-10 bot team with strong statistical significance (p = 0.001)
- Head-to-head scores showed bots consistently underperforming vs. Pros: -11.3 in Q3 2024, -8.9 in Q4 2024, and -17.7 in Q1 2025 — showing **no improvement trend** for bots against humans

**Bot-vs-Bot Trends:**
- Individual bots are improving relative to each other over time
- The best-performing bot used OpenAI's **o1 model** (Metac-o1, a single-prompt template bot)
- This bot ranked in the **top 5% of Quarterly Cup participants** (25th out of 617 humans)

**Key Technical Insights:**
- **Models matter more than prompts**: The underlying LLM model is the most important factor for AI forecasting performance
- **Scaffolding still helps**: One hobbyist bot using only GPT-4o finished 8th vs. the template GPT-4o bot finishing 44th (second-to-last), demonstrating significant gains from better prompting and agent tools
- **AskNews outperforms** Exa and Perplexity as a search provider for bots (though not statistically significant)

**Community Prediction vs. Bots:**
- The human Community Prediction beat the bot team on 27 Quarterly Cup questions (sample too small for significance testing)

### Tournament Structure
- 34 bot makers + 11 Metaculus template bots competed on 424 questions
- Questions were binary (57%), numeric (21%), and multiple-choice (22%)
- 10 Pro forecasters benchmarked on 100 of those questions

</Summary>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
