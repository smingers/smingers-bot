Analysis:
This meta-forecast hinges on whether new information during the next 11 days will push the Metaculus community prediction above 55 %.  Key drivers likely to move the crowd are:  
• Any Home Office or parliamentary statement on the “earned settlement” consultation outcome or implementation timetable.  
• Political signals (polling on immigration, cabinet leaks, party manifestos ahead of the May 2026 local elections).  
• Media or think-tank analysis questioning feasibility or legality of a 10-year baseline.  
Because the object of prediction is a Metaculus crowd number rather than the policy itself, forecasters also need:  
• A base-rate for how often Metaculus community predictions move ≥1–3 pp or cross a 55 % threshold in the final 10–14 days for comparable policy questions.  
• Understanding of the community-prediction algorithm and typical intra-day volatility.  
Current context already gives the policy proposal and its nominal April 2026 start date, but lacks:  
1. Any up-to-the-minute government or parliamentary signals since Nov 2025.  
2. The consultation’s scheduled response date and whether it might still land before 13 Mar 2026.  
3. Opposition or support from business, migrant-rights or Conservative/Reform UK MPs that could influence expectations.  
4. Latest opinion polling on immigration salience (possible political pressure).  
5. Historical data on Metaculus crowd-prediction movement magnitudes.  
The search strategy therefore mixes:  
• Historical/reference queries on past Metaculus volatility and UK settlement-rule change timelines (base rate & mechanism).  
• Current-news queries for fresh governmental, parliamentary, and media signals (current state & key drivers).  
• Contrarian-angle queries for organised push-back or procedural delays that could lower the crowd’s probability.
