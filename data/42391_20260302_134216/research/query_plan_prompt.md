You are a research planner for a forecasting question. Your task is to design a search strategy that gives forecasters the best possible evidence base.

QUESTION:
Will the community prediction be higher than 55.00% on 2026-03-13 for the Metaculus question "Will the UK increase the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years before May 2026?"?

Type: binary

Background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/42135
- Original question title: Will the UK increase the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years before May 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-03-01: 55.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before May 1, 2026, the baseline qualifying period for settlement (permanent residency) in the UK is 10 or more years.

Original fine print: 
> To qualify a change must affect at least some applicants for permanent residency before May 2026. If a change is announced, but does not come in to effect before May 1, 2026, it will not be sufficient to resolve this question.
> 
> This question will not consider any modifications that change the residency requirement; only the baseline requirement will matter for this question.
> 
> If the baseline requirement is increased for some visa categories but not others, this question will resolve according to how the new baseline would have applied to the majority of grants in [the year ending September 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-september-2025/how-many-indefinite-leave-settlement-and-euss-settled-status-and-citizenship-grants-have-been-issued-in-the-uk#s-2).

Original background: 
> Immigrants to the UK can currently apply for permanent residency – or "indefinite leave to remain" – after living in the country [for 5 years under most visa categories](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain#:~:text=You%20must%20usually%20have%20lived%20and%20worked%20in%20the%20UK%20for%205%20years).
> 
> Shabana Mahmood, the Home Secretary, has proposed a change to the requirements to apply for this status; the core changes proposed include increasing [the baseline requirement to 10 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#:~:text=a\)%20increasing%20the%20baseline%20qualifying%20period%20for%20settlement%20to%2010%20years) while also introducing modifying factors which may increase or reduce this period.
> 
> This change is driven by [forecasts of record high applications](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#future-settlement-forecast) for residency over the next five years and a backdrop of [21% of British people polled](https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx) considering immigration to be Britain's "biggest national problem".
> 
> In November 2025, Mahmood indicated that the changes would come into effect [in April 2026.](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-11-20/debates/E3CE324D-7597-40C5-8697-DB48AA843CFC/MigrationSettlementPathway#contribution-44475956-0A57-466A-A4EA-7A7FD64AAD83)

`{"format":"metaculus_binary_cp_rises","info":{"post_id":42135,"question_id":41903,"last_cp":0.55}}`

Resolution criteria:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/42135) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-03-13 03:38:43 is higher than 55.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 55.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-03-13 03:38:43, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

## Summary of UK Immigration Settlement Statistics (Year Ending September 2025)

### Key Statistics on Settlement Grants

**Overall Indefinite Leave Grants:**
- Total of **491,453 grants of indefinite leave** in the year ending September 2025
- 67% (330,745) were EUSS settled status grants
- 32% (158,137) were settlement grants under other immigration routes
- Remaining <1% were "immediate settlement" grants

**Settlement (ILE/ILR) Trends:**
- 158,137 total settlement grants — a **6% increase** from the previous year
- Settlement grants have followed an **upward trajectory since 2018**

**Breakdown by Category:**
- **Work-related:** 59,642 grants (+11%), with Skilled Worker route comprising ~75% of these
- **Family-related:** 43,942 grants (+5%), mostly to former Partner visa holders
- **Refugee/protection:** 35,725 grants (slight -2% decrease, but still double 2019 volumes)
- **Other (Long Residence, Private Life, etc.):** 18,828 grants (+15%)

### EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)
- 330,745 settled status grants in the latest year (down 5%)
- Since scheme launch, **4.3 million settled status grants** total
- ~1.5 million people still hold pre-settled status as of September 2025
- From January 2025, some pre-settled status holders can receive **automated settled status grants** without applying; ~53,750 have received this so far

### Citizenship
- **240,613 British citizenship grants** in the latest year (-10% from previous year)
- Still higher than any of the preceding 13 years
- 171,859 grants through naturalisation (nearly double recent historical norms)

### Policy Context Noted in Article
- The Home Office opened a **public consultation ("A Fairer Pathway to Settlement")** in November 2025, proposing to reform settlement rules, open for a 12-week period
- Current qualifying period is **5 years** under most work or family routes; **10 years** under the long residence route

*Note: The article is a statistical release and does not provide details on the outcome or timeline of the proposed policy changes beyond noting the consultation was opened.*

<QuestionSource url="https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain#:~:text=You%20must%20usually%20have%20lived%20and%20worked%20in%20the%20UK%20for%205%20years">
## Summary of GOV.UK: "Check if you can get indefinite leave to remain"

**Note:** This appears to be the current (as of retrieval) official GOV.UK guidance page on Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). It does not appear to reflect any proposed changes to the qualifying period.

### Key Facts from the Article:

**Current Qualifying Periods:**
- **Standard work visas:** Must have lived and worked in the UK for **5 years**
- **Tier 1 visa:** Can be **2 or 3 years**
- **Innovator Founder or Global Talent visa:** Can be **3 years**
- **UK Ancestry visa:** **5 years**
- **British National (Overseas) visa:** **5 years**
- **Long residence route:** **10 years or more** of living in the UK (this route already exists as a separate pathway)

### Relevance to the Forecasting Question:
This page reflects the **current rules** — the standard baseline qualifying period remains at **5 years** for most visa categories. There is **no indication on this page** that the proposed change to a 10-year baseline has been implemented. The 10-year period mentioned refers only to the existing long-residence route, not the standard settlement pathway.

This suggests that, as of the page's current state, the policy change has **not yet come into effect**.

## Summary: "A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" – UK Government Consultation (November 2025)

### Core Proposal
The UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced and is consulting on an **"earned settlement" model** that would increase the baseline qualifying period for permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain) from **5 years to 10 years**. The government states this change has already been announced and the consultation concerns the conditions under which settlement can be earned.

### Key Facts & Statistics
- **Net migration 2021–2024**: approximately 2.6 million people (roughly 1 in 30 current UK residents)
- **Health and Care visa arrivals 2022–2024**: ~616,000 individuals, over half being dependants
- **Forecast settlement grants 2026–2030**: ~1.6 million people, peaking at ~450,000 annually in 2028
- **21% of British people** (Gallup poll) consider immigration Britain's "biggest national problem"
- The Home Secretary indicated in November 2025 that changes would come into effect **in April 2026**

### Proposed Changes
1. **Baseline qualifying period**: Increased from 5 to **10 years**
2. **15-year qualifying period**: For Skilled Workers in roles below RQF Level 6 (below bachelor's degree level), and separately proposed for Health and Care visa migrants on lower wages
3. **Mandatory requirements** (non-negotiable):
   - Clean criminal record
   - High standard of English
   - Sustained economic contribution
   - No debt in the UK
4. **Time adjustment model**: Contributions can **reduce** the 10-year baseline (e.g., high-talent/high-taxpayer status, senior public service roles, extensive volunteering)
5. **Time penalties** for those claiming benefits or entering illegally
6. **Retroactive application**: Proposed to apply to **all current residents** who have not yet received settled status

### Notable Exemptions
- Those **already holding settled status** are unaffected
- **EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)** holders are out of scope
- **Windrush Scheme** grants are out of scope
- **Faster pathways** retained for spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong

### Consultation Scope
- Open for **12 weeks**
- Seeks views on children's pathways, armed forces members, crime victims, and whether benefits should be reserved for British citizens rather than those with settled status

### Source Reliability
This is a **primary government document** (Command Paper CP 1448), presented to Parliament by the Home Secretary — high reliability.

## Summary: "A Fairer Pathway to Settlement" – UK Government Consultation (November 2025)

### Core Proposal
The UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced and is consulting on an **"earned settlement" model** that would increase the baseline qualifying period for permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain) from **5 years to 10 years**. The government states this change has already been announced and frames the consultation as determining the conditions under which settlement can be earned.

### Key Proposed Changes

**Baseline Requirements (non-negotiable):**
- Clean criminal record (full "root and branch review" of criminality thresholds planned)
- High standard of English
- Sustained and measurable economic contribution
- No outstanding debt in the UK

**Time Adjustment Model (accelerating or delaying the 10-year baseline):**
- *Earlier settlement* possible for: high-talent/high-taxpaying individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers, and spouses/dependants of British citizens (not subject to consultation)
- *Delayed settlement* for: those who have claimed benefits, or those who entered the country illegally

**Special Categories:**
- A **15-year baseline** is proposed for lower-skilled/lower-wage migrants (specifically those on Health and Care visas below RQF level 6)
- A **20-year settlement path** already announced for refugees on "core protection" support
- Children, armed forces members, and crime victims are flagged as cohorts requiring special consideration

### Retroactive Application
Critically, the government proposes applying these new rules to **everyone currently in the UK who has not yet received settled status**, meaning those approaching their current 5-year qualifying date would be subject to the new requirements once immigration rules change.

### Exclusions
- Those who already hold settled status are **not affected**
- EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) holders are **out of scope**
- Windrush Scheme grants are **out of scope**

### Driving Factors
- Forecast of ~**1.6 million settlement grants between 2026–2030**, peaking at ~450,000 in 2028
- Net migration of **2.6 million people between 2021–2024**
- Fiscal concerns about migrants' public service usage vs. tax contributions
- A Gallup poll cited showing **21% of British people** consider immigration the country's biggest national problem

### Timeline
- The consultation runs for **12 weeks** from November 2025
- The Home Secretary indicated in Parliament (November 2025) that changes would come into effect in **April 2026**

### Rights Under Settlement (Consultation Question)
The document also raises whether **benefits access** should be restricted to British citizens only, rather than those with settled status.

## Summary: U.K. Leads World in Concern About Migration (Gallup, February 11, 2026)

### Key Statistics

- **21% of Britons** named immigration as their No. 1 national concern in 2025, statistically tied with the economy (23%)
- This makes the UK **the most likely country in the world** to cite immigration as the top national problem, compared to a global median of just **1%** across 107 countries
- UK net migration fell sharply: **204,000** in the year ending June 2025, down from nearly **650,000** in the year ending June 2024
- The UK has **17% foreign-born residents** — similar to the US (15%), Norway (18%), and Netherlands (16%) — yet those countries show far lower immigration concern

### Political Breakdown (Named Source: Gallup)

- **48% of Reform UK supporters** cite immigration as the biggest national problem — roughly twice the percentage of any other major European party's supporters
- **23% of Conservative supporters** and **16% of Labour supporters** share this concern
- **25% of politically unaligned Britons** name immigration as the top issue — roughly twice the next highest (Poland and Ireland at 13%)
- Labour, Conservative supporters, and nonpartisans still rank **economic issues above immigration**

### Key Predictors of Immigration Concern (Gallup Analysis)

Gallup identified five key predictors after controlling for demographic variables (specific predictors listed but not enumerated in the article text). Notably, **gender, employment status, urban/rural location, personal wellbeing, and actual household income** showed **no statistically significant relationship** with immigration concern.

### Historical Acceptance vs. Current Concern

- Between 2016–2023, UK acceptance of migrants **grew gradually**: by 2023, **80%** viewed immigrants as a good thing, **79%** were comfortable with an immigrant neighbor, and **75%** accepted an immigrant marrying a close relative
- This suggests concern about immigration as a **policy/systemic issue** can coexist with personal acceptance of individual migrants

### Political Implications

- Reform UK, despite holding few parliamentary seats, has been "setting the political weather" and attracting Conservative defections
- The findings highlight the **balancing act for PM Keir Starmer**, particularly ahead of local elections where immigration-focused voters could increase headwinds for the government

*This article is directly cited in the background of the target Metaculus question and provides context for the political pressure driving the proposed UK settlement qualifying period change.*

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze the question and the pre-research context
2. Identify what information a skilled forecaster would need beyond what's already available
3. Generate 8 search queries to fill the remaining gaps

COVERAGE DIMENSIONS (ensure your queries collectively address these):
- Base rate: Historical frequency, distribution, or precedent for the outcome being forecast. How often has something like this happened before?
- Resolution mechanism: How exactly does this question resolve? What specific data source, metric, threshold, or event determines the outcome? What is the current state of that mechanism?
- Key drivers: The 1-3 most important causal factors that will determine the outcome. What moves this metric or makes this event more/less likely?
- Current state: Latest news, data points, or developments relevant to the question
- Contrarian check: Information that could support the less obvious outcome. What would make the unlikely scenario happen?

TYPE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
- For binary "will X reach Y by Z" questions: Include a query for the historical base rate of X reaching Y in comparable timeframes. Also query the current trajectory/trend.
- For numeric questions: Query for recent values of the metric AND its primary upstream drivers. For financial metrics, query for upcoming scheduled events (data releases, FOMC meetings, earnings) before the resolution date.
- For multiple choice questions: Ensure at least one query is relevant to each substantive option. For catch-all/"other" options, query for the base rate of non-favored outcomes.

AVAILABLE TOOLS (only use tools listed here):
- Google: Keyword search. Write short queries (max 6 words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages. Best for reference pages, datasets, official reports.
- Google News: Keyword search over recent news articles. Max 6 words. Best for breaking news, recent events, and current developments.
- Agent: Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. Write a detailed, multi-part query of up to 3 sentences. Best for complex questions needing synthesis across sources, base rate computation, or multi-factor analysis. IMPORTANT: Use exactly one Agent query, tagged [HISTORICAL], for base rate or reference class research. Do not use Agent for current events.
- AskNews: Semantic (meaning-based) news search. Write a descriptive 1-2 sentence natural language query focusing on the underlying topic, key actors, and context. Include relevant scope: geography, industry, time period. Avoid ambiguous acronyms. Best for finding conceptually related coverage even without exact keyword matches.
- FRED: Federal Reserve Economic Data. Use a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE", "CPIAUCSL") or a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate"). Returns historical data with computed statistics. Only use for economic/financial data.
- yFinance: Yahoo Finance ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "^GSPC"). Returns price history, fundamentals, analyst targets, and options data. Only use for stocks, indices, or ETFs.
- Google Trends: A search term (e.g., "hospital"). Returns 90-day search interest data with base rate analysis. Only use when the question specifically involves Google Trends data.

TAG each query as [HISTORICAL] (for base rates, reference classes, past data, background context) or [CURRENT] (for recent news, latest values, current developments, upcoming events). Aim for roughly 60% historical and 40% current. Include at least 2 of each.

Format your answer exactly as below. Each query on its own line. The source in parentheses, temporal tag in brackets. Do not wrap queries in quotes.

Analysis:
{Your analysis of the question, what the pre-research context already provides, what key information gaps remain, and your search strategy.}

Search queries:
