This change applies to all new asylum seekers, while unaccompanied minors will retain the previous five-year status. Home Office Minister Shabana Mahmood stated the reform aims to prevent the asylum system from becoming a 'factor of attraction' for irregular crossings and smuggling networks, citing the Danish model which saw asylum applications reach their lowest level in 40 years. The Home Office noted that the previous five-year system was among the 'most generous offers for refugees in Western Europe'. Under a broader reform announced in November, refugees may eventually have to wait 20 years to qualify for permanent residence, a provision pending parliamentary vote. Statistics from the Home Office, published on February 26, show that 100,625 people applied for asylum in the UK in 2025, a 4% decrease from the record 108,138 applications in 2024. However, irregular arrivals increased by 7% in 2025, reaching 46,497 people, following a 19% rise in 2024. The government faces growing political pressure regarding migration, highlighted by the rise of the anti-immigration Reform UK party.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 07:53 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/fr/monde/-royaume-uni-le-statut-de-r%C3%A9fugi%C3%A9-ramen%C3%A9-%C3%A0-30-mois-renouvelables/3846022)\n\n**'New passport rule is yet another dig. Even though we were born here we are still classed as immigrants' - Nottinghamshire Live**\nDual nationals in Nottingham, including British-Italians Lorenzo Salzano (63), Filomena Onorati, and Maria-Luisa Piliero (35), report feeling confused and marginalized by new UK entry requirements effective from February 25, which mandate that dual citizens must present a British passport or a Certificate of Entitlement alongside their foreign passport. These individuals, some born in the UK and residing in Nottingham for decades, claim they were not adequately informed about the changes, with Salzano describing the guidance as 'messier' and Onorati stating, 'Even though we were born here we are still classed as immigrants.' The new rules are part of a wider immigration reform and the rollout of the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) system, which requires non-visa visitors to pay a \u00a316 fee (rising to \u00a320) for entry. Obtaining the necessary documentation is costly, with a British passport costing \u00a3100 and a Certificate of Entitlement costing \u00a3589. Nadia Whittome, MP for Nottingham East, criticized the Home Office for ineffective communication, noting that despite announcements in 2024, many citizens are only now discovering the rules. In response, a Home Office Spokesperson stated that public information advising dual citizens to travel with a valid UK passport or Certificate of Entitlement has been available since October 2024, and that enforcement of the ETA scheme was announced for February 25, 2026. The article highlights concerns that travelers could face humiliation, denial of boarding, or forced payment of fees to return home if they are unaware of these requirements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[Nottingham Post](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/new-passport-rule-yet-another-10835426)\n\n**California Legislators Propose Ban on ICE Presence at Voting Centers to Protect Immigrant Voters**\nDemocratic legislators Tom Umberg and Sabrina Cervantes in California have introduced two legislative initiatives, SB 884 and SB 73, designed to prohibit Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from conducting enforcement actions within 200 feet of voting centers. According to Section 404 of the official document, this restriction aims to ensure that all citizens, regardless of immigration status, can vote without fear of federal detention. The initiative is a response to concerns regarding the current administration's actions and statements from Donald Trump, who intends to 'nationalize' future elections, alongside intentions from the FBI and the Department of Justice to access state electoral data, and requests from Steve Bannon to mobilize military personnel and ICE agents to polling places. The amended version of SB 884 was passed by the Senate on February 19, 2026, establishing a new chapter in the Electoral Code that will be effective for the 2026, 2027, and 2028 general elections. However, an exception applies to the state primary elections scheduled for June 2, 2026. The article was published on March 1, 2026, by El Comercio Per\u00fa.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 11:53 PM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/usa/local-us/presentan-proyecto-de-ley-en-california-que-prohibira-presencia-de-ice-en-centros-de-votacion-como-beneficara-a-los-inmigrantes-y-cuando-entrara-en-rigor-nnda-nnrt-noticia/)\n\n**California Senators Propose Bill to Ban ICE Operations Near Polling Places**\nCalifornia Senators Tom Umberg and Sabrina Cervantes, both Democrats, introduced a legislative package comprising SB 884 and SB 73 to shield state elections from federal interference and intimidation. According to a press release issued on February 20, 2026, the initiative aims to protect the electoral integrity of the 2026, 2027, and 2028 election cycles, excluding the state primary scheduled for June 2, 2026. The core provision of SB 884, amended on February 19, 2026, explicitly prohibits the enforcement of federal immigration laws within a 200-foot (60.96-meter) radius of any polling place, county election office, or ballot counting and auditing site. This restriction specifically targets agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal immigration officers, barring them from conducting operations or actions related to immigration enforcement in these zones. Senator Umberg cited personal experience from the 1988 election, where he witnessed individuals impersonating police officers intimidating Latino voters, to justify the measure. The legislation is a direct response to recent federal actions and statements, including calls by President Donald Trump to 'nationalize' elections, attempts by the Department of Justice and FBI to access state voter records, public assertions by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem regarding federal authority over election infrastructure, and exhortations by Steve Bannon to deploy ICE and military personnel at voting centers. Senator Umberg stated that California 'has the constitutional right and responsibility to administer its own safe and protected elections,' regardless of federal compliance. Violations of the 200-foot restriction will be enforceable under Section 18582 of the Election Code. Additionally, Section 405 extends restrictions on political proselytism to the same 200-foot perimeter around election buildings and outdoor voting areas, including drive-thru sites.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 08:09 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/california/el-proyecto-de-ley-de-california-que-prohibiria-a-los-agentes-del-ice-en-los-centros-de-votacion-nid01032026/)\n\n**Anguish in Labour as Keir Starmer compared to Joe Biden and polls tell horror...**\nAccording to an anonymous source speaking to the Express on February 28, 2026, the Labour Party is facing internal 'anguish' after polling data revealed Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's net approval rating has plummeted to minus 49, the lowest since he took office and lower than ratings achieved by predecessors Theresa May, Boris Johnson, and Rishi Sunak. The source compared the situation to the Democratic Party's challenges with Joe Biden, stating, 'You'd be bonkers if you challenged him now because there's nothing we can do now... I think we absolutely get wiped out everywhere.' The political crisis follows a by-election defeat in Gorton and Denton where Labour finished behind the Green Party and Reform UK. Former Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner described the result as a 'wake-up call' and urged colleagues to 'rededicate' themselves to a 'Labour agenda that puts people first.' Conversely, a Labour frontbencher dismissed the need to shift left, rejecting the influence of Green Party leader Zack Polanski, whom he called 'the hypnotist,' asserting, 'We won't change tact because of one pretty unique constituency and by-election.' A Starmer loyalist urged against 'catastrophising,' claiming Starmer is 'head and shoulders the strongest member of our Labour cabinet.' Meanwhile, a Government source labeled the claim that Labour is 'losing Muslim voters over immigration' as 'plain wrong.' Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is preparing a speech to advocate for reducing migration, citing Denmark's success in lowering asylum applications to the lowest level in 40 years and removing 95% of rejected asylum seekers. Opinium data indicates 21% of Labour voters might consider switching to Nigel Farage's Reform UK, while 42% of Conservative voters might back Reform. James Crouch, head of policy and public affairs at Opinium, warned that the traditional bases of both major parties are 'more fragile than ever' as Labour loses ground to the Greens and Conservatives to Reform.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 08:00 PM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2176663/anguish-labour-keir-starmer-compared-joe-biden)\n\n**Trump Approval Plummets Ahead of 2026 Midterms as Key Voter Sectors Turn Against Him**\nAccording to a CNN poll conducted between February 17 and February 20, 2026, President Donald Trump's approval rating has plummeted to 36%, while disapproval has risen to 63%, representing a 27-point drop from the 47% approval rating recorded in February 2025. The article attributes this decline to immigration raids and fluctuating economic indices throughout 2025. Two specific voter demographics are identified as key areas of lost support: voters earning less than $50,000 annually, where approval stands at 35% against 65% disapproval (a net index of -30 points), and independent voters, where only 26% approve compared to 73% disapproval (a net deficit of 47 points). This erosion of support is particularly significant for the 2026 midterm elections, where 6,122 legislative seats are at stake across 46 states, accounting for 82% of the 7,386 total legislative seats in the US, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). President Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address at 21:00 Eastern Time on Tuesday. A CNN poll indicates that 57% of respondents believe the address should focus on the economy and cost of living, compared to 13% for immigration and 11% for the state of democracy. The address will take place one week after the Supreme Court ruled that certain tariffs were invalid due to the president exceeding his authority, and it will be the first State of the Union delivered during a partial or full government shutdown.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 04:47 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/elecciones-2026-en-usa-una-encuesta-revela-que-donald-trump-pierde-apoyo-de-dos-sectores-clave-en-nid28022026/)\n\n**Andy Burnham would 'probably' have won Gorton and Denton by-election, says Labour deputy leader - Manchester Evening News**\nFollowing the Gorton and Denton by-election result, Labour Deputy Leader Lucy Powell stated in an interview with the BBC's Newscast podcast that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham 'probably would have' won the seat, noting that the Green Party 'wouldn't have gone after the seat in the same way'. Powell, the sole member of the Labour national executive committee (NEC) to vote in favor of Burnham standing, explained she accepted 'collective responsibility' for the decision to block him due to concerns about a concurrent mayoral by-election in Greater Manchester. She emphasized that the party must learn from Burnham's popularity, where voters 'see in him someone who is on their side, someone who is delivering those Labour values and those Labour policies', and noted that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is 'very focused on doing' this better nationally. While Burnham has not yet commented on the result, Starmer vowed to 'fight on' despite the 'disappointing' outcome. Concurrently, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is expected to warn against a leftward shift, introducing tougher immigration legislation next week; a source close to her told the Times that the idea 'Labour is losing Muslim voters over immigration is just plain wrong'.

Dhlamini identifies the 'who' as immigrants, South Africans, and political figures including Gayton McKenzie's Patriotic Alliance (PA), Herman Mashaba's ActionSA, Germany's AfD, France's Marine Le Pen, UK's Nigel Farage, and US President Donald Trump. The 'what' involves critiquing the 'scarcity' and 'values' arguments used against immigration, while the 'where' focuses on South Africa, specifically mentioning KwaZulu-Natal, townships, and the impact of the July 2021 looting. The 'when' references the publication date of February 28, 2026, and historical contexts like apartheid and the Group Areas Act. The 'why' is to advocate for a system that filters out criminals and those rejecting the Constitution while welcoming hardworking immigrants who contribute to the economy. Dhlamini contends that the 'fixed pie fallacy' is incorrect, citing that immigrants often fill roles locals do not want and that immigrant-run spaza shops revitalized abandoned assets in townships, leading to competition from retailers like Spar, Shoprite, and Pick n Pay which created jobs. Regarding welfare, the author claims South Africa should not extend welfare to immigrants, noting that taxpayers who fund the system often do not use it, citing personal experience with private schools, medical aid, and municipal water issues where residents now buy water from Checkers. The article proposes a shared criminal database with independent audits to bar individuals with records of murder, rape, robbery, or theft, and suggests prioritizing applicants from Christian states while still processing asylum seekers equally.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 04:17 PM\nSource:[news24](https://www.news24.com/citypress/voices/mpiyakhe-dhlamini-closed-borders-are-antiubuntu-so-heres-a-better-fix-for-mzansi-20260228-0977)\n\n**Former UK prime minister declares 'biggest problem is Islamism,' says other issues are reversible**\nFormer UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, who served for 49 days in 2022, stated on 'The Katie Miller Podcast' that 'Islamism' is the 'biggest problem' facing the United Kingdom, asserting that 'everything else is reversible' through policy fixes like tax cuts or deregulation. Speaking to host Katie Miller on a Tuesday episode, Truss argued that while economic and political issues can be solved, 'radical Islam' presents an existential threat that is 'very difficult to reverse.' Truss identified 'Islamification' as a core issue for Europe, specifically citing the UK's 'structural issues' regarding migration, including a 'salary threshold' that is 'far too low' and allowing 'bogus students' and 'chain family immigration' which she linked to 'Pakistani Muslim enclaves.' She advocated for banning migration from specific countries, stating, 'We should ban everybody from Afghanistan coming to Britain,' citing 'highest rates of sexual assault' for that nation. Truss also credited the platform X (formerly Twitter) with revolutionizing the news landscape by exposing 'grooming gangs,' claiming 'tens of thousands of British girls age 11 and upwards' were 'groomed, raped, tortured by Pakistani Muslim gangs' and that the 'mainstream media in Britain has largely tried to cover it up.'

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood advocates for a 'brave' approach, proposing to replace permanent asylum with temporary status and citing the Danish social democrats as a model for delivering 'firm but fair' immigration controls, even if it alienates 'bourgeois' liberals. In contrast, Deputy Leader Angela Rayner called for Labour to be 'braver' but offered what the article describes as 'attention-seeking waffle' about a 'Labour agenda that puts people first,' whereas Mahmood's policies are presented as the practical realization of that agenda. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is reportedly keeping the young people's minimum wage below the 21+ rate to avoid pricing young people out of jobs, countering Green Party 'fantasy economics' which the article claims would lead to unemployment. The article argues that demands for Labour to move 'left' by legalizing heroin or leaving NATO are 'absurd' and that Green Party policies are ideologically incoherent; for instance, a YouGov poll found that 26% of Green voters supported 'military retaliation' to retake Greenland, contradicting their pacifist image. Dan Carden, leader of the 'Blue Labour' caucus, and Liam Byrne, chair of the business and trade committee, suggest Labour should focus on fighting 'bad actors' like Fujitsu, energy companies, and food retailers to stand up for 'the little guy,' rather than adhering to a rigid left-right spectrum. The author, citing Janan Ganesh of the Financial Times, concludes that Labour's unpopularity stems from issues of preparedness, the 'Tory inheritance,' competence, and leadership, rather than a lack of left-wing policies. The piece notes that Labour members, who are 'unrepresentative of the nation,' hold the power to choose the new leader, a dynamic that may inadvertently favor Mahmood if she continues her current trajectory, despite her current unpopularity with the membership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 02:05 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/labour-shabana-mahmood-angela-rayner-uk-politics-b2929452.html)\n\n**Britain's Awakening**\nAccording to multiple 2025\u20132026 polling sources, a clear majority of the British public opposes pro-immigration policies, with only 15% supporting higher immigration levels. The Ipsos poll (6\u201310 February 2026, N=1,071) found 67% believe asylum-seeker numbers are excessive, 56% for family migration, 43% for work visas, and 39% for students. 61% of those concerned cite poor border controls, and 59% blame easy access to welfare. 61% say immigration harms housing availability, and 54% link it to higher crime. YouGov tracker (February 2026) shows 69% believe immigration over the past decade has been 'too high.' Gallup World Poll (2025 data, published February 2026) ranks immigration as the UK\u2019s top national problem, with 21% identifying it as such\u2014far above the global median of 1%. The British Future/Ipsos Immigration Attitudes Tracker (June\u2013July 2025, N=3,003) found 57% want immigration reduced, including 41% wanting a 'lot' less\u2014a rise from 25% in 2022. Support for Reform UK, which opposes mass migration, has surged, especially among older voters, non-graduates, and Brexit Leavers. Regional differences are stark: England shows strong concern (55\u201365%+ wanting reductions), while Scotland, with only 5% foreign-born and fewer small-boat arrivals, shows lower anxiety (49% see migration as good for Scotland). Wales and Northern Ireland mirror England\u2019s trends, with rising Reform UK support and heightened immigration concern. Despite net migration falling to 204,000 in the year to June 2025 (down from 649,000), a January 2026 Guardian-commissioned poll found 67% of voters wrongly believe numbers are still rising, with 80% of Reform voters and 63% saying 'significantly,' indicating deep public distrust in official figures. Nationalism is rising: 36% of Britons now believe one must be born in the UK to be 'truly British' (up from 19% in 2023), and 37% of Reform voters say they\u2019d be prouder of Britain in 10 years with fewer ethnic minorities. The rise in nationalist sentiment is framed not as extremism but as a democratic correction to years of elite-driven open-border policies. Polls show a growing demand for sovereignty, selectivity, and prioritization of British citizens, culture, and infrastructure. While 33\u201350% acknowledge economic or cultural benefits of targeted migration, the public overwhelmingly prioritizes limits due to strain on housing, NHS, schools, and social cohesion. Foreign nationals, though 12\u201313% of the population, are disproportionately featured in certain crimes (drugs, fraud, sexual offenses), and 43,000 small-boat arrivals in 2025 (up 38% from 2024) have fueled public anxiety. The article concludes that the public has clearly spoken: support for pro-immigration agendas is minimal and shrinking, and the nationalist surge reflects a rational demand for controlled, selective immigration that protects national identity and well-being.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 02:07 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@fgkvgcvd/britains-awakening-0db2c6082ce5)\n\n**Broken Labour has been blown away by Zack Polanski's Green machine**\nIn the Gorton and Denton by-elections on February 27, 2026, the Green Party achieved a historic victory, marking the first time the Greens have won a by-election in the UK. Zack Polanski\u2019s Green machine secured 41% of the vote, a 26-percentage-point swing from Labour, and finished 12 percentage points ahead of Reform UK. This win represents a turning point in British politics, as it is the first time Labour has lost to a credible left-wing, progressive rival in a safe seat since the party\u2019s founding over a century ago. The Greens\u2019 success in a large, ethnically diverse urban area underscores Labour\u2019s vulnerability in such constituencies. The result also highlights a growing dual threat to Labour: from the populist right (Reform UK) and from a progressive 'Red-Green' challenger on the left. Despite Labour\u2019s criticism of Green candidate Hannah Spencer over her views on drugs, immigration, and Gaza, voters embraced her message, suggesting a shift in voter allegiance. The Conservative candidate received only 1.8% of the vote\u2014record-low in a Westminster by-election\u2014while the Liberal Democrats were irrelevant. The defeat signals a significant erosion of Labour\u2019s dominance, particularly in urban centers, and raises concerns about the party\u2019s long-term viability. However, the article cautions that the two-party system may not be dead, citing Labour\u2019s revival after 2019, though the Greens\u2019 momentum is undeniable. The outcome is described as one of the most significant by-election defeats for a governing party in history, particularly when coming from a previously fringe left-wing force.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2026 06:59 AM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/labour-green-zack-polanski-uk-politics-gorton-denton-by-election-b2928662.html)\n\n**UK enforces digital travel system, mandatory eVisas for Indians - The Tribune**\nThe UK has enforced a new digital travel system effective February 25, 2026, mandating eVisas for Indian travellers and Electronic Travel Authorisations (ETAs) for visitors from 85 nationalities, including the US, Canada, and France, who previously did not require visas. The transition replaces paper-based visa stickers and physical biometric residence permits (BRPs), biometric residence cards (BRCs), and passport visa vignettes with a fully digital UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) system. The Home Office confirmed that over 10 million eVisas have been issued since the rollout began, and more than 19 million ETAs have been successfully applied for since October 2023, generating over 383 million pounds in revenue. An ETA costs 16 pounds, is valid for two years or until passport expiry, and allows multiple entries. Airlines are now required to verify digital travel permissions before boarding, and passengers without valid eVisas, ETAs, or other documentation may be denied boarding. The Home Office emphasized that eVisas cannot be lost, stolen, or tampered with and that all eVisa holders, including those with EU Settlement Scheme status, must keep their UKVI accounts updated with current passport details. The digital Certificate of Entitlement, now issued in digital format, is valid indefinitely and eliminates the need for renewal with passport changes. The system is part of a broader effort to modernize border security, improve efficiency, and enable a contactless UK border in the future. The Home Office noted that most ETA applications are approved within minutes, though travelers are advised to apply at least three working days in advance. The scheme is comparable in cost to the US ESTA (40 USD) and the upcoming EU ETIAS (20 EUR). British and Irish citizens remain exempt from ETAs but must present a valid British passport or Certificate of Entitlement upon arrival. The enforcement of this system marks a significant step toward a fully digitized immigration framework, with the UK government stating that the change does not alter existing rights or immigration status.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 10:06 AM\nSource:[The Tribune](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/uk-enforces-digital-travel-system-mandatory-evisas-for-indians/)\n\n**Reform UK Pushes for ICE-Like Immigration Policy Amid Rising Popularity**\nReform UK, led by experienced politician Nigel Farage, is advocating for an immigration policy resembling that of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), aiming to halt what they describe as an 'invasion' of immigrants and deport thousands.

The party also seeks to withdraw from several human rights obligations if it comes to power. While immigration to the UK declined overall last year, over 41,000 asylum seekers arrived via small boats across the English Channel in 2025, the second-highest recorded number.

Labour MP Mike Tapp, representing Dover, accused Yusuf of 'spreading hate' and labeled him 'not a decent person and lacks British values,' referencing a prior incident during a BBC Question Time event in December 2024 where Yusuf\u2019s response to an audience member\u2014'if you had paid attention to what we were announcing you would not have that view'\u2014was deemed 'rude' by attendees.

He claimed, 'You can't afford it... You can't have an economy with 9 million people on benefits and massive immigration. The UK is effectively being colonized by immigrants, isn't it?' In response, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the remarks as 'rude and wrong' and demanded an apology, stating on social media that 'the UK is a proud, tolerant, and diverse nation' and that Ratcliffe 'should apologize.' The Downing Street spokesperson added that the comments 'play into the hands of those who seek to divide our country' and urged an immediate apology. However, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Lisa Nandy contradicted this stance, telling Sky News that Ratcliffe's view on people being overlooked and underutilized in society was 'correct.' Immigration remains a top concern for UK voters; the 2016 Brexit referendum was significantly driven by immigration issues. Despite this, net migration has risen in recent years, with 37,000 illegal immigrants crossing the English Channel in October 2025\u2014exceeding the total for 2024 and marking the second-highest figure on record, behind only 2022.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 04:02 AM\nSource:[\u73af\u7403\u7f51](https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4QL4w2RKsoe)\n\n**Immigration to the United Kingdom Set to Dominate May 2026 UK Elections as Public Concern Hits Record Highs**\nImmigration has emerged as the dominant issue in the lead-up to the 7 May 2026 UK local, Scottish, and Welsh elections, surpassing the economy in public concern. A Gallup survey shows 21% of UK adults identify immigration as the top national problem, rising to 48% among Reform UK supporters. YouGov data from January 2026 indicates 23% of Britons believe tackling immigration should be the government\u2019s top priority, with 56% of Reform and 37% of Conservative voters prioritizing it. Despite a sharp decline in net migration to 204,000 in the year ending June 2025\u2014down two-thirds from the previous year\u2019s peak and returning to pre-pandemic levels\u201467% of voters incorrectly believe immigration is still rising, including 80% of Reform UK supporters. Confidence in Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour government on immigration has plummeted to 18%, with 74% expressing little or no confidence. In response, the government has introduced tougher policies, including doubling the wait for indefinite leave to remain from five to ten years, stricter English language requirements, longer citizenship waits for refugees, curbs on family reunification, and accelerated deportations. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has led the effort, citing public demand and small-boat crossings. Analysts warn the May elections\u2014covering over 4,000 council seats, mayoral races, the Scottish Parliament, and the Senedd\u2014could become a referendum on immigration. Reform UK is expected to gain ground, particularly in England, where it has already won mayoral positions and hundreds of local seats. In Scotland and Wales, immigration intersects with devolved debates, though independence and economic concerns remain central. Gallup notes that high issue salience, low trust in government, and strong Reform support among motivated voters may threaten Labour incumbents. If Reform voter turnout remains high, the results could signal deeper political fragmentation, with traditional parties losing ground to right-wing and left-wing insurgents. The outcome will test whether Labour\u2019s hardening stance has curbed the populist tide or merely exposed deep public distrust on a defining issue of the era.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 10:27 PM\nSource:[smobserved.com](https://www.smobserved.com/story/2026/02/16/news/span-classbrnwsbreaking-news-spanimmigration-to-the-united-kingdom-set-to-dominate-may-2026-uk-elections-as-public-concern-hits-record-highs/9659.html)\n\n**UK Young Professionals Scheme 2026: Ballot for Indians opens Feb 17**\nThe UK has announced the 2026 ballot for the India Young Professionals Scheme (IYPS) visa, opening on February 17, 2026, at 2:30 pm IST and closing on February 19, 2026, at the same time.

This perception gap persists even as the Labour government, under Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, implements hardline immigration reforms, including proposals to delay British citizenship for refugees by up to 20 years, confiscate asylum seekers\u2019 assets, restrict family reunions, and return refugees if conditions improve in their home countries. Despite these measures, 74% of voters expressed little or no confidence in the government\u2019s ability to control borders\u2014up from 70% in May 2025\u2014and only 18% had confidence, a three-point decline. Confidence dropped sharply among Labour voters in 2024, falling by 17 percentage points. The public remains fixated on small boat arrivals, with 79% wanting the government to prioritize stopping these vessels, even though they accounted for less than 5% of total arrivals (43,000 in 2025, up 38% from 2024 but below the 2022 peak of 46,000). Only 10% believe reducing legal net immigration should be the top priority. Fewer than one in five voters credit the current government for the decline in migration, with a similar number attributing it to the previous Conservative administration. Migration minister Mike Tapp claimed the drop reflects Labour\u2019s success in restoring order to the system. However, Labour MP Kim Johnson warned that mimicking Reform Party policies risks increasing racism and undermining vital sectors like health and social care due to falling work visas.

Note: This is distinct from (though related to) the Labour government's proposal to extend the ILR qualifying period to 10 years.\n\n---\n\n### Key Findings\n\n**On Ending the Granting of ILR:**\n- **44% support** ending the granting of ILR; **43% oppose** \u2014 essentially divided\n\n**On Removing ILR from Current Holders:**\n- Only **29% support** removing ILR from those who already hold it\n- **58% oppose** removing ILR from existing holders\n- Even among those who support ending new ILR grants, only **41%** support stripping it from current holders\n\n**Groups the Public Would Exempt from ILR Removal:**\nA majority of the public want to allow permanent residency to continue for:\n- Those who have lived in Britain **over 10 years**\n- Those in **full-time work and paying taxes**\n- **NHS workers**\n- Those **married to a British citizen** or with British citizen children\n- Those who have **set up businesses** in the UK\n- **Retired people** (49% say they should stay permanently vs. 35% combined for visa/removal)\n\n**More Divided Cases:**\n- **Ukrainian refugees**: 44% permanent stay vs. 43% temporary visa, 5% removal\n- **Disabled people unable to work**: Only 39% say permanent stay; 29% temporary visa, 16% removal\n\n---\n\n### Party Breakdown\n\n| Voter Group | Support Ending New ILR Grants | Support Removing Existing ILR |\n|---|---|---|\n| Reform UK | 64% | 54% |\n| Conservative | 51% | 44% (42% against) |\n| Labour | 40% | ~20-29% |\n| Lib Dem | 37% | ~20-29% |\n| Green | 35% | ~20-29% |\n\n- Labour, Lib Dem, and Green voters are **71\u201380% opposed** to removing ILR from existing holders\n- Reform UK voters would strip ILR from most groups, with the **only exception** being those resident 20+ years (only 38% would remove)\n- Most Conservative voters would strip ILR from Ukrainians (61%), disabled non-workers (62%), and those with British citizen children (57%), but fewer than half for other groups\n\n---\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question\nThis article focuses on **Reform UK's more radical ILR abolition proposal**, not directly on Labour's proposal to extend the qualifying period to 10 years. However, it provides useful context on **public opinion regarding immigration policy**, showing the public is broadly divided on restricting ILR but strongly opposed to retroactive removal \u2014 which may inform the political feasibility of related settlement policy changes.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://connaughtlaw.com/indefinite-leave-to-remain-10-years-uk-analysis/\">\n## Summary of Article on UK ILR 10-Year Qualifying Period Proposal\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article appears to be from an immigration advisory/legal website rather than a primary news source. It lacks specific publication dates for some claims and reads partly as commentary/analysis rather than straight reporting. Some claims should be treated with appropriate caution.\n\n### Core Policy Proposal\nThe UK government's **Immigration White Paper 2025** proposes extending the standard Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) qualifying period from **5 years to 10 years** for most work-based visa routes. This is described as one of the most significant proposed changes to settlement policy in decades.\n\n### Government Rationale\n- Officials argue the current 5-year timeline creates \"automatic progression\" without sufficient assessment of integration or contribution\n- **Deputy PM Angela Rayner** cited concerns about welfare entitlement costs once migrants achieve settlement\n- The **Social Market Foundation** suggests fiscal costs of welfare access are a significant motivating factor\n- Officials note that migrants who arrived during the 2019\u20132023 high-immigration period will become eligible for settlement throughout this parliamentary term under current rules\n\n### Implementation Timeline\n- **Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood** indicated changes would come into effect in **April 2026**\n- Formal consultation was expected following a **Westminster Hall debate in September 2025**\n\n### Affected Sectors\n- **NHS**: ~150,000 international workers potentially facing extended timelines, raising retention concerns\n- **Technology and financial services**: Competitive concerns raised about UK's global talent positioning\n\n### Retroactive Application Controversy\n- Government technical documents acknowledge \"a number of those currently in the UK are likely to leave\" due to extended timelines\n- No clear transition arrangements have been announced for current visa holders approaching the 5-year threshold\n- **Two e-petitions opposing the changes have attracted over 265,000 combined signatures**, including one specifically opposing retroactive application to existing Skilled Worker visa holders\n- Government responses indicate consultation will address retroactive application, but the overall policy direction appears fixed\n\n### \"Earned Settlement\" Framework\n- A companion framework would offer **accelerated qualification** for migrants demonstrating exceptional contributions (salary, tax contributions, shortage occupation employment, community engagement)\n- Specific criteria remain undefined pending formal consultation\n\n### International Competitiveness Context\n- Canada: 3-year pathway; Australia: 4-year pathway; New Zealand: 2-year pathway\n- Germany and France: 5-year pathways\n- The proposed UK 10-year timeline would be significantly longer than major competitor destinations\n</Summary>\n"
