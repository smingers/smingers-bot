There is **no indication on this page** that the proposed change to a 10-year baseline has been implemented. The 10-year period mentioned refers only to the existing long-residence route, not the standard settlement pathway.\n\nThis suggests that, as of the page's current state, the policy change has **not yet come into effect**.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#:~:text=a\\\">\n## Summary: \"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement\" \u2013 UK Government Consultation (November 2025)\n\n### Core Proposal\nThe UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced and is consulting on an **\"earned settlement\" model** that would increase the baseline qualifying period for permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain) from **5 years to 10 years**. The government states this change has already been announced and the consultation concerns the conditions under which settlement can be earned.\n\n### Key Facts & Statistics\n- **Net migration 2021\u20132024**: approximately 2.6 million people (roughly 1 in 30 current UK residents)\n- **Health and Care visa arrivals 2022\u20132024**: ~616,000 individuals, over half being dependants\n- **Forecast settlement grants 2026\u20132030**: ~1.6 million people, peaking at ~450,000 annually in 2028\n- **21% of British people** (Gallup poll) consider immigration Britain's \"biggest national problem\"\n- The Home Secretary indicated in November 2025 that changes would come into effect **in April 2026**\n\n### Proposed Changes\n1. **Baseline qualifying period**: Increased from 5 to **10 years**\n2. **15-year qualifying period**: For Skilled Workers in roles below RQF Level 6 (below bachelor's degree level), and separately proposed for Health and Care visa migrants on lower wages\n3. **Mandatory requirements** (non-negotiable):\n   - Clean criminal record\n   - High standard of English\n   - Sustained economic contribution\n   - No debt in the UK\n4. **Time adjustment model**: Contributions can **reduce** the 10-year baseline (e.g., high-talent/high-taxpayer status, senior public service roles, extensive volunteering)\n5. **Time penalties** for those claiming benefits or entering illegally\n6. **Retroactive application**: Proposed to apply to **all current residents** who have not yet received settled status\n\n### Notable Exemptions\n- Those **already holding settled status** are unaffected\n- **EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)** holders are out of scope\n- **Windrush Scheme** grants are out of scope\n- **Faster pathways** retained for spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong\n\n### Consultation Scope\n- Open for **12 weeks**\n- Seeks views on children's pathways, armed forces members, crime victims, and whether benefits should be reserved for British citizens rather than those with settled status\n\n### Source Reliability\nThis is a **primary government document** (Command Paper CP 1448), presented to Parliament by the Home Secretary \u2014 high reliability.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#future-settlement-forecast\">\n## Summary: \"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement\" \u2013 UK Government Consultation (November 2025)\n\n### Core Proposal\nThe UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced and is consulting on an **\"earned settlement\" model** that would increase the baseline qualifying period for permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain) from **5 years to 10 years**. The government states this change has already been announced and frames the consultation as determining the conditions under which settlement can be earned.\n\n### Key Proposed Changes\n\n**Baseline Requirements (non-negotiable):**\n- Clean criminal record (full \"root and branch review\" of criminality thresholds planned)\n- High standard of English\n- Sustained and measurable economic contribution\n- No outstanding debt in the UK\n\n**Time Adjustment Model (accelerating or delaying the 10-year baseline):**\n- *Earlier settlement* possible for: high-talent/high-taxpaying individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers, and spouses/dependants of British citizens (not subject to consultation)\n- *Delayed settlement* for: those who have claimed benefits, or those who entered the country illegally\n\n**Special Categories:**\n- A **15-year baseline** is proposed for lower-skilled/lower-wage migrants (specifically those on Health and Care visas below RQF level 6)\n- A **20-year settlement path** already announced for refugees on \"core protection\" support\n- Children, armed forces members, and crime victims are flagged as cohorts requiring special consideration\n\n### Retroactive Application\nCritically, the government proposes applying these new rules to **everyone currently in the UK who has not yet received settled status**, meaning those approaching their current 5-year qualifying date would be subject to the new requirements once immigration rules change.\n\n### Exclusions\n- Those who already hold settled status are **not affected**\n- EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) holders are **out of scope**\n- Windrush Scheme grants are **out of scope**\n\n### Driving Factors\n- Forecast of ~**1.6 million settlement grants between 2026\u20132030**, peaking at ~450,000 in 2028\n- Net migration of **2.6 million people between 2021\u20132024**\n- Fiscal concerns about migrants' public service usage vs. tax contributions\n- A Gallup poll cited showing **21% of British people** consider immigration the country's biggest national problem\n\n### Timeline\n- The consultation runs for **12 weeks** from November 2025\n- The Home Secretary indicated in Parliament (November 2025) that changes would come into effect in **April 2026**\n\n### Rights Under Settlement (Consultation Question)\nThe document also raises whether **benefits access** should be restricted to British citizens only, rather than those with settled status.\n\n---\n*Note: The article is the full government consultation document. It confirms the 10-year change has been announced as policy, with the consultation focused on the surrounding conditions rather than the core qualifying period change itself.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx\">\n## Summary: U.K. Leads World in Concern About Migration (Gallup, February 11, 2026)\n\n### Key Statistics\n\n- **21% of Britons** named immigration as their No. 1 national concern in 2025, statistically tied with the economy (23%)\n- This makes the UK **the most likely country in the world** to cite immigration as the top national problem, compared to a global median of just **1%** across 107 countries\n- UK net migration fell sharply: **204,000** in the year ending June 2025, down from nearly **650,000** in the year ending June 2024\n- The UK has **17% foreign-born residents** \u2014 similar to the US (15%), Norway (18%), and Netherlands (16%) \u2014 yet those countries show far lower immigration concern\n\n### Political Breakdown (Named Source: Gallup)\n\n- **48% of Reform UK supporters** cite immigration as the biggest national problem \u2014 roughly twice the percentage of any other major European party's supporters\n- **23% of Conservative supporters** and **16% of Labour supporters** share this concern\n- **25% of politically unaligned Britons** name immigration as the top issue \u2014 roughly twice the next highest (Poland and Ireland at 13%)\n- Labour, Conservative supporters, and nonpartisans still rank **economic issues above immigration**\n\n### Key Predictors of Immigration Concern (Gallup Analysis)\n\nGallup identified five key predictors after controlling for demographic variables (specific predictors listed but not enumerated in the article text). Notably, **gender, employment status, urban/rural location, personal wellbeing, and actual household income** showed **no statistically significant relationship** with immigration concern.\n\n### Historical Acceptance vs. Current Concern\n\n- Between 2016\u20132023, UK acceptance of migrants **grew gradually**: by 2023, **80%** viewed immigrants as a good thing, **79%** were comfortable with an immigrant neighbor, and **75%** accepted an immigrant marrying a close relative\n- This suggests concern about immigration as a **policy/systemic issue** can coexist with personal acceptance of individual migrants\n\n### Political Implications\n\n- Reform UK, despite holding few parliamentary seats, has been \"setting the political weather\" and attracting Conservative defections\n- The findings highlight the **balancing act for PM Keir Starmer**, particularly ahead of local elections where immigration-focused voters could increase headwinds for the government\n\n*This article is directly cited in the background of the target Metaculus question and provides context for the political pressure driving the proposed UK settlement qualifying period change.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://github.com/Metaculus/forecasting-tools\">\n## Summary\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is entirely unrelated to the question about UK settlement qualifying periods.

It is a 2022 EA Forum post discussing shifts in the Metaculus community prediction for AGI arrival timelines. It contains **no relevant information** about UK immigration policy, settlement requirements, or the specific Metaculus question regarding the UK's potential increase of the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years.\n\n---\n\n### Article Content (for completeness):\n\nThe post notes that as of April 2022, the Metaculus community prediction for when the first AGI would become publicly known shifted to **2036**, representing a 6-year acceleration from prior estimates. The author attributes this shift potentially to recent AI papers (likely referencing PaLM or similar) generating attention and new forecasters joining the question.\n\nKey observations from the post:\n- The AGI prediction had previously been as early as **2032 (August 2020)** and as late as **2047 (October 2021)**, highlighting significant volatility\n- The forecaster count grew ~20% in a short period, raising questions about **composition bias** vs. genuine belief updates\n- The author is uncertain whether the shift reflects thoughtful updating or crowd-following behavior driven by hype\n\n**This article provides no useful information for forecasting the target question about UK immigration settlement policy.**\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dRbvHfEwb6Cuf6xn3/forecasting-agi-insights-from-prediction-markets-and-1\">\n## Summary\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article appears to be largely unrelated to the target question about UK settlement qualifying periods.

It does not directly address the proposed change to increase the qualifying period to 10 years.\n\n### Key Facts About Current ILR Qualifying Periods\n\nThe article outlines various existing qualifying periods for ILR (settlement/permanent residency) in the UK:\n\n- **2 years**: Spouses/partners of British citizens who arrived before 8 July 2012\n- **4 years**: Holders of pre-April 2006 HSMP visas; Commonwealth Armed Forces veterans (4 years service)\n- **5 years**: Standard qualifying period for most visa categories (Work/Family routes, spouses arriving after 9 July 2012, humanitarian protection)\n- **10 years**: \"Long residence\" route for continuous lawful residence (with absence limits of no more than 540 days total or 180 days at one time)\n- **7\u201310 years**: Children under 18 with 7 years residence can apply for leave to remain; ILR after 10 years\n- **19\u201330+ years**: Private life grounds for older applicants\n\n### Other Notable Points\n- ILR holders pay **home student rates** for higher education\n- ILR can **lapse** after 2+ continuous years outside the UK\n- ILR holders can apply for **British citizenship** after holding ILR for 12+ months, with 5 years ordinary residence\n\nThe article does **not** reference the proposed reform to increase the baseline qualifying period to 10 years under the Mahmood proposals.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9wlney23o\">\n## Summary: UK Plans to Extend Settlement Qualifying Period to 10 Years\n\n**Source:** BBC, November 20, 2025\n\n### Core Announcement\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced plans to extend the qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR/settlement) from **5 to 10 years**, affecting an estimated **2.6 million migrants** who arrived since 2021. Those already holding settlement status would not be affected.\n\n### Tiered Waiting Periods\nThe proposed system introduces variable timelines based on circumstances:\n- **3 years**: High earners (\u00a3125,140+ in prior 3 years)\n- **5 years**: Doctors/NHS nurses; earners above \u00a350,270\n- **10 years**: New baseline standard\n- **15 years**: Migrants claiming benefits for under 12 months; health and social care visa holders\n- **20 years**: Migrants reliant on benefits for more than 12 months\n\n### Key Conditions & Modifiers\n- A-level standard English required\n- Clean criminal record\n- Minimum earnings of \u00a312,570/year for at least 3 years\n- Volunteering and English competency can reduce wait times\n- Family members **do not** gain automatic status alongside the main applicant\n\n### Implementation Timeline\n- Consultation period ends **February 12, 2026**\n- Rollout planned from **spring 2026**\n\n### Political Reactions\n- **Conservatives**: Supportive but warned of potential loopholes; urged a migration cap\n- **Unison (public service union)**: Called changes \"devastating\" to essential workers, warning care services could collapse\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.employmentlawworldview.com/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-in-the-uk-preparing-your-workforce-for-change/\">\n## Summary: UK Settlement Policy Overhaul \u2013 Employment Law Worldview (December 8, 2025)\n\n**Author:** Carine Elliott | **Source:** Employment Law Worldview\n\n### Core Proposal\nThe UK Government's Command Paper (*A Fairer Pathway to Settlement*) proposes replacing the current 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) with a **merit-based, 10-year baseline qualifying period**. The system would be tiered:\n- **Shorter periods** for high earners, key public service workers, or those demonstrating \"exceptional integration\"\n- **Longer periods** (up to 20\u201330 years) for those with immigration breaches or heavy reliance on public funds\n- Eligibility assessed against **four pillars** (not fully detailed in the article)\n\n### Timeline Indicated\n- Consultation closes: **February 12, 2026**\n- Statement of Changes expected: **Spring 2026**\n- Implementation likely: **Summer 2026 onwards**\n- Current ILR rules remain in place until then\n\n### Key Uncertainties\nThe article highlights significant gaps around **transitional arrangements**, including:\n- Whether existing visa holders can settle under current (5-year) rules\n- Whether new integration/contribution requirements apply retroactively\n- Impact on sponsorship costs and workforce stability\n\n### Employer Implications\n- Increased sponsorship costs and administrative complexity over a decade-long tracking period\n- Heightened retention challenges, particularly in healthcare, technology, and hospitality\n- Need for proactive employee communication to manage anxiety among sponsored workers currently expecting 5-year settlement\n\n### Notable Framing\nThe article is written from an **HR/employer advisory perspective**, urging businesses to participate in the consultation to influence transitional provisions.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: For Metaculus binary policy questions, collect community prediction 14 days pre-resolve vs on resolve; % crossing 55 % threshold upward\nThe material returned by the searches confirms four separate facts that are directly relevant to the original task but it also shows that a decisive part of the information we need is still missing.\n\n1.  Time-series data on the Metaculus \u201ccommunity prediction\u201d do exist and can be programmatically downloaded.  \n    \u2022  Both the open-source Ergo library (ergo.ought.org \u2013 \u201cprediction_timeseries\u201d attribute) and the newer Forecasting-Tools package (github.com/Metaculus/forecasting-tools) expose the full timestamped history of the community forecast for every question, including binary policy questions.  \n    \u2022  The Metaculus public API used by those libraries delivers records that include the community median at roughly one-hour granularity from question launch to resolution.\n\n2.  Prior published analyses demonstrate that the history field is sufficiently clean for statistical work, but none of the papers/posts surveyed extract the exact metric we need.  \n    \u2022  Arb Research / EA Forum posts (zeL52MFB2Pkq9Kdme; JN6wm6u5MMmqwdnEs) and Metaculus\u2019s own \u201cExploring AI track record\u201d post apply bulk downloading of prediction histories to compute Brier scores, calibration curves, and belief-movement metrics; therefore the method we need (pull T-14-days snapshot and final snapshot) is technically feasible.  \n    \u2022  However, none of those studies look at \u201cbinary policy questions\u201d, at the \u201c14-day pre-resolve\u201d cut-off, or at the \u201ccrossing of a 55 % threshold\u201d. All aggregate either the full lifetime (\u201cevaluated at all times\u201d) or the \u201c50 %, 25 %, 10 % time-remaining\u201d milestones.\n\n3.  No public dataset or published table already lists, for the subset \u201cpolicy, binary\u201d, the community probabilities 14 days before resolution and at resolution.  \n    \u2022  The Metaculus Benchmark and the Future-as-Label RL work (arxiv.org/2601.06336; emergentmind.com topics) focus on all domains or on AI questions, but do not provide the two-point comparison we need.  \n    \u2022  The EA Forum pieces supply large CSV/Sheets dumps, yet manual inspection of those sheets (linked in the posts) shows only a single \u201cpublish-midpoint-close\u201d sample, not the precise \u221214 day mark.\n\n4.  Consequently, we cannot yet compute the required statistic:  \n       \u201c% of Metaculus binary policy questions whose community prediction was \u2264 55 % exactly 14 days before resolution but finished > 55 % at resolution.\u201d\n\nGaps that remain\nA.  A precise list of \u201cbinary policy questions\u201d.  The Metaculus taxonomy includes \u201cPolicy & Governance\u201d, \u201cPolitics\u201d, \u201cRegulation\u201d, etc., but neither the posts nor the benchmark explicitly tag a subset as \u201cpolicy\u201d.  \nB.  For each of those questions, two exact numbers are still needed:  \n        \u2022  community_prediction(t = resolve_time \u2212 14 days)  \n        \u2022  community_prediction(t = resolve_time)  \nC.  Once those are available, we must perform a simple indicator test (crossing from \u2264 0.55 to > 0.55) and then compute the proportion across the universe.\n\nWhat the current sources give us\n\u2022  Code to download and parse the necessary time series (Ergo, Forecasting-Tools).  \n\u2022  Examples proving that the resolution timestamp is included in the API feed (because the above studies draw Brier scores exactly at resolution).  \n\u2022  Empirical confirmation that Metaculus community medians do sometimes move materially in the final days (e.g., \u201cbelief movement\u201d metrics in zeL52M\u2026 show median absolute change >10 % in the last 10 % of lifetime for many questions). That makes the crossing analysis non-trivial and worth computing.\n\nWhy we still need additional data\nThe original query demands a quantitative answer (\u201ccollect \u2026 % crossing 55 % threshold upward\u201d). None of the returned literature or tools supplies that table out-of-the-box, and none of the authors reports that percentage. The data must therefore be drawn directly from the API and processed.\n\nSummary\n\u2022  The infrastructure and precedent for extracting community-prediction histories are well documented (Ergo library, Forecasting-Tools).  \n\u2022  No published analysis to date has extracted the exact 14-days-pre-resolve snapshot for the subset \u201cbinary policy questions\u201d.  \n\u2022  Therefore, to answer the forecasting meta-question (how often does the crowd cross upward past 55 % in the last two weeks?) we still need to:  \n     1.  Compile the relevant question list (binary + policy).  \n     2.  Use the API to pull the time-series.  \n     3.  Compute the crossing statistic.\n\nUntil that extraction is carried out, the requested percentage cannot be reported.</Agent_report>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai/scaling-superforecasting-ai-forecasting-tournaments-road-to-epistemic-security-with-deger-turan/\">\n## Summary\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is largely irrelevant to the question about UK settlement qualifying periods.
