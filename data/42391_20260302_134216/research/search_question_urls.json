It does not appear to reflect any proposed changes to the qualifying period.\n\n### Key Facts from the Article:\n\n**Current Qualifying Periods:**\n- **Standard work visas:** Must have lived and worked in the UK for **5 years**\n- **Tier 1 visa:** Can be **2 or 3 years**\n- **Innovator Founder or Global Talent visa:** Can be **3 years**\n- **UK Ancestry visa:** **5 years**\n- **British National (Overseas) visa:** **5 years**\n- **Long residence route:** **10 years or more** of living in the UK (this route already exists as a separate pathway)\n\n### Relevance to the Forecasting Question:\nThis page reflects the **current rules** \u2014 the standard baseline qualifying period remains at **5 years** for most visa categories. There is **no indication on this page** that the proposed change to a 10-year baseline has been implemented. The 10-year period mentioned refers only to the existing long-residence route, not the standard settlement pathway.\n\nThis suggests that, as of the page's current state, the policy change has **not yet come into effect**.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#:~:text=a\\\">\n## Summary: \"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement\" \u2013 UK Government Consultation (November 2025)\n\n### Core Proposal\nThe UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced and is consulting on an **\"earned settlement\" model** that would increase the baseline qualifying period for permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain) from **5 years to 10 years**. The government states this change has already been announced and the consultation concerns the conditions under which settlement can be earned.\n\n### Key Facts & Statistics\n- **Net migration 2021\u20132024**: approximately 2.6 million people (roughly 1 in 30 current UK residents)\n- **Health and Care visa arrivals 2022\u20132024**: ~616,000 individuals, over half being dependants\n- **Forecast settlement grants 2026\u20132030**: ~1.6 million people, peaking at ~450,000 annually in 2028\n- **21% of British people** (Gallup poll) consider immigration Britain's \"biggest national problem\"\n- The Home Secretary indicated in November 2025 that changes would come into effect **in April 2026**\n\n### Proposed Changes\n1. **Baseline qualifying period**: Increased from 5 to **10 years**\n2. **15-year qualifying period**: For Skilled Workers in roles below RQF Level 6 (below bachelor's degree level), and separately proposed for Health and Care visa migrants on lower wages\n3. **Mandatory requirements** (non-negotiable):\n   - Clean criminal record\n   - High standard of English\n   - Sustained economic contribution\n   - No debt in the UK\n4. **Time adjustment model**: Contributions can **reduce** the 10-year baseline (e.g., high-talent/high-taxpayer status, senior public service roles, extensive volunteering)\n5. **Time penalties** for those claiming benefits or entering illegally\n6. **Retroactive application**: Proposed to apply to **all current residents** who have not yet received settled status\n\n### Notable Exemptions\n- Those **already holding settled status** are unaffected\n- **EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)** holders are out of scope\n- **Windrush Scheme** grants are out of scope\n- **Faster pathways** retained for spouses/dependants of British citizens and BN(O)s from Hong Kong\n\n### Consultation Scope\n- Open for **12 weeks**\n- Seeks views on children's pathways, armed forces members, crime victims, and whether benefits should be reserved for British citizens rather than those with settled status\n\n### Source Reliability\nThis is a **primary government document** (Command Paper CP 1448), presented to Parliament by the Home Secretary \u2014 high reliability.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/earned-settlement/a-fairer-pathway-to-settlement-statement-and-accompanying-consultation-on-earned-settlement-accessible#future-settlement-forecast\">\n## Summary: \"A Fairer Pathway to Settlement\" \u2013 UK Government Consultation (November 2025)\n\n### Core Proposal\nThe UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced and is consulting on an **\"earned settlement\" model** that would increase the baseline qualifying period for permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain) from **5 years to 10 years**. The government states this change has already been announced and frames the consultation as determining the conditions under which settlement can be earned.\n\n### Key Proposed Changes\n\n**Baseline Requirements (non-negotiable):**\n- Clean criminal record (full \"root and branch review\" of criminality thresholds planned)\n- High standard of English\n- Sustained and measurable economic contribution\n- No outstanding debt in the UK\n\n**Time Adjustment Model (accelerating or delaying the 10-year baseline):**\n- *Earlier settlement* possible for: high-talent/high-taxpaying individuals, senior public service workers, extensive community volunteers, and spouses/dependants of British citizens (not subject to consultation)\n- *Delayed settlement* for: those who have claimed benefits, or those who entered the country illegally\n\n**Special Categories:**\n- A **15-year baseline** is proposed for lower-skilled/lower-wage migrants (specifically those on Health and Care visas below RQF level 6)\n- A **20-year settlement path** already announced for refugees on \"core protection\" support\n- Children, armed forces members, and crime victims are flagged as cohorts requiring special consideration\n\n### Retroactive Application\nCritically, the government proposes applying these new rules to **everyone currently in the UK who has not yet received settled status**, meaning those approaching their current 5-year qualifying date would be subject to the new requirements once immigration rules change.\n\n### Exclusions\n- Those who already hold settled status are **not affected**\n- EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) holders are **out of scope**\n- Windrush Scheme grants are **out of scope**\n\n### Driving Factors\n- Forecast of ~**1.6 million settlement grants between 2026\u20132030**, peaking at ~450,000 in 2028\n- Net migration of **2.6 million people between 2021\u20132024**\n- Fiscal concerns about migrants' public service usage vs. tax contributions\n- A Gallup poll cited showing **21% of British people** consider immigration the country's biggest national problem\n\n### Timeline\n- The consultation runs for **12 weeks** from November 2025\n- The Home Secretary indicated in Parliament (November 2025) that changes would come into effect in **April 2026**\n\n### Rights Under Settlement (Consultation Question)\nThe document also raises whether **benefits access** should be restricted to British citizens only, rather than those with settled status.\n\n---\n*Note: The article is the full government consultation document. It confirms the 10-year change has been announced as policy, with the consultation focused on the surrounding conditions rather than the core qualifying period change itself.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/701990/leads-world-concern-migration.aspx\">\n## Summary: U.K. Leads World in Concern About Migration (Gallup, February 11, 2026)\n\n### Key Statistics\n\n- **21% of Britons** named immigration as their No. 1 national concern in 2025, statistically tied with the economy (23%)\n- This makes the UK **the most likely country in the world** to cite immigration as the top national problem, compared to a global median of just **1%** across 107 countries\n- UK net migration fell sharply: **204,000** in the year ending June 2025, down from nearly **650,000** in the year ending June 2024\n- The UK has **17% foreign-born residents** \u2014 similar to the US (15%), Norway (18%), and Netherlands (16%) \u2014 yet those countries show far lower immigration concern\n\n### Political Breakdown (Named Source: Gallup)\n\n- **48% of Reform UK supporters** cite immigration as the biggest national problem \u2014 roughly twice the percentage of any other major European party's supporters\n- **23% of Conservative supporters** and **16% of Labour supporters** share this concern\n- **25% of politically unaligned Britons** name immigration as the top issue \u2014 roughly twice the next highest (Poland and Ireland at 13%)\n- Labour, Conservative supporters, and nonpartisans still rank **economic issues above immigration**\n\n### Key Predictors of Immigration Concern (Gallup Analysis)\n\nGallup identified five key predictors after controlling for demographic variables (specific predictors listed but not enumerated in the article text). Notably, **gender, employment status, urban/rural location, personal wellbeing, and actual household income** showed **no statistically significant relationship** with immigration concern.\n\n### Historical Acceptance vs. Current Concern\n\n- Between 2016\u20132023, UK acceptance of migrants **grew gradually**: by 2023, **80%** viewed immigrants as a good thing, **79%** were comfortable with an immigrant neighbor, and **75%** accepted an immigrant marrying a close relative\n- This suggests concern about immigration as a **policy/systemic issue** can coexist with personal acceptance of individual migrants\n\n### Political Implications\n\n- Reform UK, despite holding few parliamentary seats, has been \"setting the political weather\" and attracting Conservative defections\n- The findings highlight the **balancing act for PM Keir Starmer**, particularly ahead of local elections where immigration-focused voters could increase headwinds for the government\n\n*This article is directly cited in the background of the target Metaculus question and provides context for the political pressure driving the proposed UK settlement qualifying period change.*\n</QuestionSource>\n"
