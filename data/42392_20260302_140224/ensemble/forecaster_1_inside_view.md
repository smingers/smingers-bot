Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED/Federal Reserve H.15 data (implicit in question):** The most recent DTB6 value is 3.53% as of 2026-02-26. This is the highest-quality factual source — authoritative, primary, no opinion content.

**First Tuesday Journal (Feb 2026):** Notes the 6-month T-bill chart was last updated 2/6/2026 without a specific rate. Moderate quality real estate market commentary. Low relevance for precise DTB6 forecasting.

**Investopedia (March 2, 2026):** Describes the Fed as in a "holding pattern" with cash yields expected to remain "fairly steady." Reputable financial education source. The "holding pattern" characterization is factual/consensus-based. Moderate relevance — supports stability thesis.

**CNBC (Oct 31, 2025):** I-bond rate article. Not relevant to DTB6.

**Singapore T-bill articles (Feb 2026):** Entirely irrelevant to U.S. DTB6.

**Federal Reserve FOMC Calendar:** Confirms next FOMC meeting is March 18-19, 2026 — after the resolution date of March 12. High-quality factual source. Critically relevant: no FOMC decision falls within the forecast window.

**FOMC Minutes (Jan 27-28, 2026):** Market-based measures indicated 1-2 rate cuts expected in 2026. Shorter-term Treasury yields were "little changed." Longer-term yields rose a few bps. High-quality institutional source. Confirms stable front-end rates and modest easing expectations.

**GO Markets article (March 2026):** Retail trading platform analysis. Notes CME FedWatch shows a pause as dominant baseline for March FOMC. CPI release scheduled for March 11. Identifies front-end rates as sensitive to surprises. Moderate quality (retail brokerage, analyst opinion). Useful for identifying key event risk.

**AskNews articles (various):**
- Multiple articles from March 2, 2026 confirm escalating Middle East conflict (U.S.-Israel strikes on Iran, Strait of Hormuz concerns). These are factual news reports from multiple independent sources (Reuters, CNBC, Saxo Markets, Commerzbank, etc.) — high credibility.
- The 10-year Treasury yield fell to ~3.93-3.97% on March 2 (11-month low) due to safe-haven demand.
- The 2-year Treasury yield fell to ~3.36-3.42%.
- Inflation concerns from oil price surge are noted, but safe-haven flows dominated on March 2.
- CPI for February 2026 is scheduled for March 11, 2026 — confirmed by multiple sources.
- January CPI came in at 2.4% YoY (below forecast of 2.5%), released Feb 13, 2026.
- Markets price in ~2 rate cuts for 2026, first cut expected around June-September.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
1. **DTB6 current value of 3.53% (Feb 26, 2026)** — authoritative FRED data. The series has been extremely stable at 3.50-3.53% for several weeks.
2. **No FOMC meeting before March 12** — confirmed by Federal Reserve calendar. The next meeting is March 18-19. This removes the primary driver of large front-end rate moves.
3. **Multiple independent sources confirm safe-haven Treasury rally on March 2, 2026** — 10-year yield fell to ~3.93%, 2-year yield fell to ~3.36-3.42%. This suggests the 6-month T-bill rate may have also dipped slightly on March 2 (though not directly confirmed). The flight-to-safety dynamic could push DTB6 slightly lower.

**Moderate evidence:**
4. **CPI release on March 11, 2026** — confirmed by multiple sources. This is one day before the resolution date. If CPI surprises to the upside (hot), DTB6 could rise 5-15 bps. If soft, DTB6 could fall 5-10 bps. January CPI was below expectations (2.4% vs 2.5% forecast), which provides some context for the trajectory.
5. **Middle East conflict driving oil prices higher** — Brent crude surged ~13% to $82+. This creates inflationary pressure that could counteract the safe-haven rally in Treasuries over time. Analysts note this could delay Fed cuts. This creates upward pressure on DTB6 over the medium term, but the immediate safe-haven effect is downward.
6. **FOMC January minutes** confirm 1-2 cuts expected in 2026, front-end yields "little changed" — supports the stability thesis.

**Weak evidence:**
7. **Investopedia "holding pattern" characterization** — general editorial opinion, but consistent with market consensus.
8. **Downward trend over 6-12 months** — DTB6 has fallen from ~4.17% to 3.53% over the past year, but the pace has slowed significantly in recent weeks.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** March 2 to March 12, 2026 — 10 calendar days, approximately 7 trading days.

**Key events within window:**
- March 11: February CPI release (one day before resolution)
- March 12: Resolution date (also potentially affected by any overnight/morning market moves post-CPI)

**If timeframe halved (~5 days):** The CPI release would likely not have occurred yet, and the prediction would be even more anchored to the current 3.53% value. Distribution would be much tighter (±5-8 bps).

**If timeframe doubled (~20 days):** The March 18-19 FOMC meeting would be included, potentially adding 10-20 bps of uncertainty. The distribution would widen considerably.

**Current timeframe assessment:** The CPI release on March 11 is the dominant event risk. The Middle East conflict adds some downward pressure via safe-haven flows, but also upward pressure via inflation concerns. These partially offset.

## (d) Justification

**Starting point:** 3.53% (Feb 26 value). The series has been in a 3.50-3.53% range for weeks.

**Downward pressures:**
- Safe-haven demand from Middle East conflict (already pushing 2-year yields to ~3.36-3.42% on March 2)
- Soft January CPI (2.4%) suggests disinflation trend intact
- Market pricing ~2 cuts in 2026, with first cut around June-September
- If February CPI also comes in soft, DTB6 could fall toward 3.40-3.45%

**Upward pressures:**
- Oil price surge (Brent +13% to $82+) could reignite inflation fears
- If February CPI surprises to the upside, DTB6 could rise toward 3.60-3.65%
- PPI data showed stronger-than-expected wholesale inflation

**Net assessment:** The safe-haven dynamic appears to be dominating on March 2, suggesting DTB6 may have already moved slightly lower (perhaps toward 3.45-3.50%). The CPI release on March 11 is the key wildcard. Given that January CPI was soft and the disinflation trend is intact, I lean slightly toward a soft February CPI as well, which would push DTB6 modestly lower.

However, the oil price surge from the Middle East conflict could push February CPI higher (though February CPI would only partially capture the March 1-2 oil spike, as it covers February data). The oil price impact on February CPI would be limited.

**Revised central estimate:** ~3.45-3.50%, reflecting:
1. The current 3.53% starting point
2. Slight downward drift from safe-haven flows
3. Modest downward bias from soft CPI expectations
4. Uncertainty from the March 11 CPI release

The distribution should be slightly wider than the outside view to account for the CPI event risk and geopolitical uncertainty.

## Distribution Calibration

**Checklist:**

1. **Target variable:** DTB6 (6-month T-bill secondary market rate, discount basis) on 2026-03-12, in percent.

2. **Outside view base rates:** Centered at 3.50-3.53%, with 10th-90th range of 3.28-3.72%. Inside view adjusts slightly downward (to ~3.45-3.50%) due to safe-haven flows and soft CPI expectations, with slightly wider tails due to CPI event risk.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈ 3.47%; mean ≈ 3.47%; this makes sense given the current rate of 3.53% and the slight downward pressure from safe-haven flows and soft inflation expectations.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - DTB6 has been at 3.50-3.53% for weeks (strong stability signal)
   - No FOMC meeting before March 12 (removes primary large-move catalyst)
   - Safe-haven flows on March 2 pushing 2-year yields to 3.36-3.42% (downward pressure)
   - February CPI release on March 11 (key event risk, could move ±10-15 bps)
   - Oil price surge from Middle East conflict (upward inflation pressure, partially offsetting)

5. **Blind spot:** If the Middle East conflict escalates dramatically and oil prices spike to $100+, inflation fears could push DTB6 higher (toward 3.65-3.75%), making my downward-leaning forecast look wrong. This would push the outcome UP.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo is 3.53%. Given the safe-haven dynamics already in play on March 2, the rate has likely already moved slightly lower. A slight nudge toward 3.50% (the recent floor) seems appropriate.

7. **Technicalities:** Values are strictly increasing, units are percent, values are within stated bounds (2.958 to 4.7955).

**Final calibration:**
- The CPI event risk warrants slightly wider tails than the outside view
- The safe-haven dynamic and soft inflation trend justify a slight downward shift in the central estimate
- The oil price surge provides a counterbalancing upward tail risk
- I'll set the median at ~3.47%, with the 10th-90th range spanning ~3.25-3.68%
