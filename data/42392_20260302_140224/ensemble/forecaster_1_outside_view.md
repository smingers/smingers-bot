Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED Series DTB6 (Federal Reserve):** Primary authoritative source. The series is published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The most recent data point is 3.53% as of 2026-02-26. This is a factual, high-quality source with no opinion content.

**Federal Reserve H.15 Release:** Confirms DTB6 values for Feb 20-26, 2026, showing stability at 3.52-3.53%. High-quality factual source. Shows the federal funds effective rate at 3.64% and the 3-month T-bill at 3.60%.

**FRED Data Summary (FREDData block):** Provides statistical context:
- 1-year mean: 3.85%, range 3.48-4.17%
- 3-month change: -0.13% (-3.6%)
- 6-month change: -0.33% (-8.5%)
- Year-over-year: down 15.3% (from 4.17% to 3.53%)
This confirms a downward trend over the past year, consistent with Fed rate cuts.

**Agent Report:** Confirms data availability but provides no computed statistics. Informational only; no actionable numerical content.

**Treasury.gov, TradingView, Investing.com:** Largely metadata/methodology; no specific numerical forecasts. Low informational value for this question.

**DGS6MO and T6MFFM FRED pages:** Related series descriptions; no specific data points provided.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: 10-day changes in DTB6 during stable Fed policy periods**
The most recent data shows DTB6 has been extremely stable: 3.50-3.53% over the past ~3 weeks. The Fed appears to be in a holding pattern. This is the most relevant reference class. In stable policy periods, 10-day changes in 6-month T-bill rates are typically very small (±5-15 bps).

**Reference Class 2: All 10-day changes in DTB6 since 2010**
The agent report attempted to compute this but couldn't. However, based on general knowledge of T-bill rate behavior, 10-day changes in the 6-month T-bill during normal periods are typically within ±20 bps, with larger moves during policy transitions.

**Reference Class 3: Changes during FOMC meeting weeks**
The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for March 18-19, 2026 (after the resolution date of March 12). So FOMC meeting effects are unlikely to be a major driver in this specific window.

**Most suitable:** Reference Class 1 (stable Fed policy period) is most appropriate. The Fed has been on hold, and the resolution date (March 12) falls before the next FOMC meeting.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** From March 2, 2026 to March 12, 2026 — approximately 10 calendar days (7 trading days).

**Historical patterns:**
- The DTB6 has been remarkably stable: 3.50-3.53% for the past 3+ weeks
- The 1-month change is essentially 0.00%
- The 3-month change is only -0.13%
- No FOMC meeting falls within this window (next meeting: March 18-19)
- CPI data for February 2026 is typically released in mid-March (around March 12, 2026 is plausible for the February CPI release)

**Key events to watch:**
- February CPI release (likely around March 12, 2026) could cause some movement
- Any unexpected economic data could shift rate expectations

**Historical volatility context:** During low-volatility periods with stable Fed policy, the 6-month T-bill rate tends to move in very small increments (1-3 bps per day). Over 7 trading days, a ±10-15 bps move would be considered significant.

## (d) Justification

The current rate is 3.53% (as of Feb 26, 2026). The series has shown remarkable stability over the past month. The Fed funds rate is at 3.64%, and the 6-month T-bill at 3.53% reflects market expectations of modest Fed easing over the next 6 months.

Key factors:
1. **Stability:** The rate has been in a 3.50-3.53% range for weeks
2. **No FOMC meeting** in the resolution window
3. **Downward trend** over 6-12 months suggests slight downward bias
4. **CPI release** around March 12 could cause a small move in either direction
5. **The 1-year range** is 3.48-4.17%, suggesting the current rate is near the lower end of recent history

Given the extreme stability observed, I expect the March 12 value to be very close to 3.53%, with a small probability of a 5-15 bps move in either direction. The slight downward trend over 6 months provides a modest downward bias.

## Outside View Calibration

The current value is 3.53%. Given:
- 7 trading days until resolution
- Extremely stable recent behavior (essentially flat for 1 month)
- No major scheduled Fed policy events in window
- Small possibility of CPI-driven moves
- Slight downward drift over longer horizon

I'll center my distribution around 3.50-3.53%, with moderate uncertainty. The 10th-90th percentile range should span roughly ±20-25 bps to account for unexpected events (surprise economic data, geopolitical events, etc.).

The distribution should be slightly left-skewed (downward bias from the ongoing easing trend), but centered very close to the current value.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.28
Percentile 20: 3.38
Percentile 40: 3.48
Percentile 60: 3.55
Percentile 80: 3.62
Percentile 90: 3.72
