**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Middle East conflict (multiple independent sources, March 1-2, 2026):** US-Israel strikes on Iran, Strait of Hormuz disruption, oil +13%. Flight to safety drove 10-year yield to 11-month low (~3.93%), 2-year yield to ~3.37-3.42%. The 6-month bill (DTB6) would be expected to follow the short end downward. This is a significant, sudden geopolitical shock with direct causal mechanism on front-end rates. Multiple independent sources confirm. **Direction: downward pressure on DTB6.**

- **Fed policy anchored (FOMC minutes + CME FedWatch):** Pause dominant for March 17-18 FOMC meeting; 1-2 cuts priced for full year 2026. No FOMC action within the resolution window (March 12 is before the March 17-18 meeting). This anchors the front-end rate. **Direction: limits upward movement.**

**Moderate evidence:**
- **February CPI release on March 11, 2026** (one day before resolution): January CPI came in soft (2.4% vs 2.5% expected). If February CPI similarly surprises to the downside, yields could fall further. If hot (tariff pass-through), yields could rise. Given the geopolitical backdrop and recent trend, a soft print seems slightly more likely. **Direction: modest downward bias, but uncertain.**

- **2-year yield at ~3.37-3.42% on March 2** (from AskNews): The 6-month bill typically trades close to the 2-year yield or slightly below it in a normal/flat curve environment. With the 2-year at 3.37-3.42% and DTB6 at 3.53% as of Feb 26, there's already some compression implied. The flight-to-safety move may have brought the 6-month bill down toward 3.40-3.45% range. **Direction: downward.**

- **Ian Lyngen (BMO, named expert):** Fed rate normalization "on hold" until inflation shows sustainable return to 2%. Supports anchored short-end rates but with slight downward bias from geopolitical risk-off. **Direction: modest downward.**

**Weak evidence:**
- **Singapore T-bill data:** Irrelevant to US DTB6.
- **I-bond rate (4.03%):** Tangentially related, not directly informative.
- **Investopedia "holding pattern" comment:** Vague, no specific DTB6 forecast.

**Net assessment:** The dominant new information since the outside view was established is the major Middle East geopolitical shock (March 1-2, 2026), which has driven a significant risk-off move in US Treasuries. The 2-year yield dropped to ~3.37-3.42%, and the 10-year to ~3.93%. Given that DTB6 was at 3.53% on Feb 26, and the short end has moved meaningfully lower, the most likely outcome is that DTB6 has already moved or will move lower by March 12. The geopolitical shock is large and sudden, representing a genuine inside-view adjustment.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution date is March 12, 2026 – 10 calendar days (approximately 7 trading days) from today (March 2, 2026). The outside view σ of ~7 bp over this horizon is appropriate for normal conditions. However, the current geopolitical shock represents an above-normal volatility regime.

**If timeframe halved (~5 days):** The geopolitical shock would dominate even more strongly, and the downward move would be more locked in. Distribution would be tighter and centered lower.

**If timeframe doubled (~20 days):** More time for geopolitical situation to evolve (either escalate further or de-escalate), more data releases (PCE on March 13), and FOMC meeting (March 17-18). Distribution would be wider and more uncertain.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view centered at 3.53% with σ≈7 bp. The key inside-view adjustment is:

1. **Geopolitical shock (strong evidence):** The 2-year yield dropped ~10-15 bp on March 2 alone. The 6-month bill typically moves somewhat less than the 2-year in flight-to-safety episodes (it's more anchored to near-term Fed expectations). A reasonable estimate is that DTB6 moved 5-10 bp lower on March 2, putting it in the 3.43-3.48% range by end of day March 2. Over the next 7 trading days, some of this may reverse (geopolitical risk premiums often partially unwind) but the conflict is ongoing and significant.

2. **CPI on March 11:** If soft (consistent with January trend), another 3-5 bp downward. If hot, 3-5 bp upward. Slight downward bias given recent trend.

3. **Fed anchoring:** Limits how far the 6-month bill can fall. With EFFR at 3.64% and no cut expected before late March/June, the 6-month bill is unlikely to fall below ~3.25-3.30%.

**Revised center:** I shift the central estimate from 3.53% to approximately 3.42-3.45%, reflecting the geopolitical shock. The distribution remains asymmetric with a slight downward skew given ongoing conflict uncertainty.

The outside view σ of 7 bp is expanded to ~10 bp to reflect elevated volatility regime.

**Distribution Calibration:**

- Central estimate (median): ~3.43% (reflecting ~10 bp downward shift from geopolitical shock, partially offset by potential mean reversion)
- σ expanded to ~10 bp given elevated volatility
- Slight downward skew

Mapping to percentiles:
- P10: 3.43 - 1.6×0.10 = 3.43 - 0.16 = ~3.27% (tail: further escalation, soft CPI, major risk-off)
- P20: 3.43 - 0.84×0.10 = ~3.35%
- P40: 3.43 - 0.25×0.10 = ~3.40%
- P60: 3.43 + 0.25×0.10 = ~3.46%
- P80: 3.43 + 0.84×0.10 = ~3.51%
- P90: 3.43 + 1.6×0.10 = ~3.59% (tail: geopolitical de-escalation, hot CPI, risk-on reversal)

**Checklist:**

1. **Target variable:** DTB6 value (percent, discount basis) on 2026-03-12 (or within 1 day prior). ✓

2. **Outside view base rate:** Normal(3.53%, σ=7bp) over 7 trading days; P10=3.42, P90=3.64. Inside view shifts center to ~3.43% and widens σ to ~10bp due to geopolitical shock. ✓

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 3.43%; mean ≈ 3.43%; makes sense given ~10bp downward shift from geopolitical shock with partial mean reversion expected. ✓

4. **Key evidence:**
   - 2-year yield dropped to ~3.37-3.42% on March 2 (flight to safety, multiple sources). ✓ Verified.
   - DTB6 last at 3.53% (Feb 26, FRED). ✓ Verified.
   - No FOMC action before March 12 (meeting March 17-18). ✓ Verified.
   - February CPI releases March 11 (one day before resolution). ✓ Verified.
   - January CPI was soft (2.4% vs 2.5% expected). ✓ Verified.

5. **Blind spot:** Geopolitical de-escalation (ceasefire, diplomatic breakthrough) could cause a sharp reversal in safe-haven flows, pushing DTB6 back toward 3.53% or higher. **Direction: upward.** I've accounted for this in the upper tail (P90: 3.59%).

6. **Status quo:** Status quo as of Feb 26 was 3.53%. But the world has changed significantly on March 1-2 with the geopolitical shock. The new "status quo" as of March 2 is likely closer to 3.43-3.48%. Slight nudge toward this new status quo is appropriate.

7. **Technicalities:** P10 < P20 < P40 < P60 < P80 < P90. ✓ Units: Percent. ✓ Values within stated bounds (2.958 to 4.7955). ✓
