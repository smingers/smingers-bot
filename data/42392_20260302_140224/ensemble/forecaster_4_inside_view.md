Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED DTB6 series (Feb-26 value = 3.53%).  Primary, highly reliable, last published observation six trading-days ago.  
2. Board of Governors H.15 release (late-Feb prints 3.52-3.53).  Same data pipeline, confirms stability.  
3. January-28 FOMC minutes.  Authoritative; shows policy-rate expectations “one-to-two cuts in 2026, little changed.”  Moderate evidence of anchor for the front end.  
4. AskNews bundle (02-Mar).  Multiple real-time wire stories: Middle-East conflict triggers risk-off flows (yields fell intraday to new 11-month lows), but analysts warn prolonged oil spike could push future inflation and delay cuts.  Short horizon, mixed direction; useful but volatile.  
5. CNBC/Investopedia pieces (late-Feb/early-Mar).  Explain “Fed in holding pattern, cash yields steady 3–5 %”.  Moderate corroboration of near-term stability.  
All other links discuss Singapore or I-bonds; factual but not relevant and therefore ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong: Daily DTB6 history shows ±1 bp day-to-day volatility and no drift over the last month.  
Moderate: Fed guidance (minutes, surveys) – first cut pencilled in for mid-2026 → keeps 6-month bill around current level.  
Moderate: Geopolitical shock caused 2-10 y yields to fall 5-10 bp on 02-Mar; if sustained it could drag DTB6 a few bp lower.  
Weak: Inflation prints due 11-Mar could surprise either way; direction and magnitude unknown.  
Weak: Commentators’ opinions of “higher-for-longer” if oil stays high – contingent, speculative over a 9-day window.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon ≈ 8-9 U.S. business days.  If it were halved, I would tighten the distribution (~±10 bp).  If doubled, I would widen tails by another ~10-15 bp each side because CPI/FOMC outcomes would begin to bite.

(d) Justification / Inside-view shift  
Status-quo persistence is still the dominant force, but:  
• Fresh safe-haven demand already pushed longer maturities down several bp – likely to shave a few bp off DTB6 in coming days (downward bias).  
• CPI on 11-Mar could bring a one-day knee-jerk; historical 6-month reactions to CPI are usually ≤ 10 bp in either direction, so I allow symmetric ±15 bp tails around the median.  
Net result: lower median by ~4 bp versus the outside view and widen the 10th/90th range slightly.

Distribution calibration
Outside-view (given earlier) median ≈ 3.525 %.  
Inside-view median set at 3.49 %, with a 10th–90th width of ~0.62 pp to accommodate a potential CPI surprise or flight-to-quality reversal.

Checklist:
1. Variable = 6-Month Treasury Bill Secondary-Market Rate (discount, %) for 12-Mar-2026.  
2. Base distribution anchored on current 3.53 %; inside view only modestly shifted.  
3. Implied median = 3.49; mean very similar; consistent with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: (i) DTB6 one-month flat line 3.52-3.53; (ii) Fed minutes – no near-term policy change; (iii) 02-Mar safe-haven rally lowered front-end yields; (iv) CPI due 11-Mar – usual ≤ 10 bp impact; (v) Conflict-driven inflation fears cap downside.  
5. Blind-spot: A shock Fed emergency hike/cut before 12-Mar – would move rate ±30–60 bp.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – distribution centred near current level.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, correct units (Percent).
