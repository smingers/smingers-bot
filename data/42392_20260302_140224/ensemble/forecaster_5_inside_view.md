Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, key points only)
• FRED DTB6 series (Fed H.15, 26 Feb 2026): last published rate 3.53 %. Primary data, high quality, no opinions.  
• First Tuesday & Investopedia (Feb–Mar 2026): give context that mortgage/cash yields have been drifting slightly lower; neither provides fresh DTB6 numbers. Medium quality, dated within past week, limited relevance.  
• January-28 2026 FOMC minutes (Fed): confirm policy rate on hold, market pricing two 25 bp cuts in 2026. High quality.  
• GO Markets March-2026 preview (29 Feb-1 Mar): notes CPI on 11 Mar, FOMC 17-18 Mar; CME FedWatch shows “pause” the base case. Reliable for describing futures pricing; brokerage opinion.  
• AskNews geopolitical round-up (1-2 Mar 2026): multiple independent wires (Reuters, CNBC, etc.) show Middle-East conflict pushed 10-yr yield to 3.93-3.97 %, 2-yr to 3.36-3.47 %. Safe-haven bid dominates; inflation-risk narrative mixed. Factual yield levels are high quality; analysis is opinion.  
No source contradicts the 3.50–3.55 % band shown by the Fed data; none signals imminent Fed action before 12 Mar.

(b) Evidence weighting
Strong: Fed policy unchanged until at least 18 Mar; six-month bill chiefly prices expected fed-funds path, hence normally stable absent a policy move.  
Moderate: 11 Mar CPI could shift June-cut odds; typical front-end reaction ≈ ±5–10 bp week-on-week.  
Moderate: Ongoing conflict keeps safe-haven demand elevated, biasing yields modestly lower unless oil-driven inflation shock dominates.  
Weak: Articles on Singapore bills, I-bond rates, long-cycle mortgage views—tangential.

(c) Timeframe
Forecast window: 10 calendar ≈ 7 trading days.  Halving to 3-4 days would cut expected σ by √(½) ≈ 0.7 (from 7 bp to ~5 bp); doubling to 20 days would raise σ to ~10 bp and widen tails proportionally.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Base-rate (2010-26) 7-day σ ≈ 7 bp around a flat mean.  
Current front-end market already embeds ≈ ½ cut in six months; CPI risk is two-sided but symmetric.  
Safe-haven flows from conflict have pulled the 2-yr yield 6-8 bp below its mid-Feb level; the 6-m bill has lagged and may “catch-down” 1-2 bp if risk-off persists.  
Net: shift the whole distribution down ~1 bp and fatten tails slightly for CPI surprise.

Distribution calibration
Outside-view median 3.53 %.  Apply –1 bp drift and keep σ ≈ 7 bp (Normal).  Rounded and made strictly increasing:

Percentile 10: 3.40 %  
Percentile 20: 3.45 %  
Percentile 40: 3.50 %  
Percentile 60: 3.54 %  
Percentile 80: 3.59 %  
Percentile 90: 3.66 %

Checklist:
1. Target: DTB6 rate (percent) for 12 Mar 2026.  
2. Outside view: N(3.53, 0.07).  
3. Implied median = 3.52, mean ≈ 3.52; consistent with “slightly lower but near-flat” rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Fed on hold till 18 Mar, (ii) last published DTB6 = 3.53, (iii) 2-yr yield down to 3.42 on 2 Mar, (iv) CPI due 11 Mar, usually ≤ ±8 bp impact, (v) conflict-driven safe-haven flows.  
5. Blind-spot: Hot CPI + sudden de-escalation shifts cuts out of 2026, pushing DTB6 > 3.70 %.  
6. Status-quo anchor respected (mode ≈ 3.53).  
7. Values increasing, correct units, within open bounds.
