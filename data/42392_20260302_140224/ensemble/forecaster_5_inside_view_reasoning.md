**Analyzing yield distribution**

I need to prepare a detailed analysis of yield distributions, looking at figures like 3.42, 3.46, 3.51, and so on. We might want to adjust our approach considering recent geopolitical conflicts, inflation concerns, and risk-off sentiments. The six-month bill is stable at around 3.53, while the two-year yield is at 3.42 and the ten-year at 3.93, indicating an inverted curve. It seems like there are expectations of further rate cuts within six months, which could impact yields significantly.**Adjusting yield distribution**

I see that the six-month yield is closely anchored to policy expectations and the Fed's reverse repo rate, though it might still drop by 3-5 basis points. Right now, the two-year yield is at 3.42, while the six-month is at 3.53, suggesting a slight downward drift for the latter. I might shift the distribution down by 1 bp for context. 

In case of a hotter CPI or an oil spike, we could see an increase in short yields. So, I'm considering median adjustments around 3.52 with a range from 3.40 to 3.66 while accounting for potential safe haven flows that might push the six-month down significantly. Let's organize this analysis into sections.
