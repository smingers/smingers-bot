**Forecasting Treasury Bill Rates**

I need to analyze and provide an outside view prediction for the 6-Month Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate on March 12, 2026, starting from today, March 2. This means I'm predicting 10 calendar days ahead. I’ll focus on historical volatility and compile data for this. I'll gather historical daily volatility and approximate past changes, especially between 2023 and 2026. It’s interesting to see how stable rates can be while still reflecting yield curve movements and Fed expectations.**Analyzing Rate Changes**

Over a 10-day horizon, typical changes for the 6-month T-bill yield might be a few basis points, often around 0.01 to 0.05. Larger moves occur during major macro announcements. Historically, from 2000 to 2023, daily shifts averaged about 7 bps, sometimes 10 bps. Currently, the yield is at 3.53, with low volatility expected. The upcoming CPI release on March 12 could cause some movement. I think we can model this as normally distributed, with adjusted standard deviations for potential variability.**Crafting Percentiles and Analysis**

I’m setting up the percentiles for the 6-month T-bill yield: 10th at 3.42, 20th at 3.46, 40th at 3.51, 60th at 3.55, 80th at 3.59, and 90th at 3.64. I want to ensure they’re strictly increasing and maybe explore larger tails for the less probable outcomes. I’ll also produce sections for source analysis by summarizing articles, reference class analysis considering a 10-day horizon since 1990, and a justification for outside view calibration with an emphasis on heavy tails. Let's get thorough with this.
