Consequently, short-term bonds led the decline: the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 4 basis points to 3.42%, while the 10-year yield climbed 3 basis points to 3.97%, according to Saxo Markets. Money markets have adjusted their expectations, pushing the anticipated timing of the Federal Reserve's next rate cut back by two months to September. Charu Chanana, Chief Investment Strategist at Saxo Markets, stated that if high oil prices continue to drive inflationary pressure, U.S. Treasuries will no longer serve as a 'pure' safe-haven asset.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 11:20 AM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/6358667)\n\n**Middle East Conflict Drives Up Eurozone and US Bond Yields Amid Inflation Fears**\nAccording to a report by N-tv published on March 02, 2026, government bond yields in the Eurozone and the United States have risen due to an escalating conflict in the Middle East that has driven up oil prices and fueled inflation concerns. Rainer Guntermann of Commerzbank stated in a Research Note that 'markets are reacting relatively orderly to the escalation in the Middle East,' though he noted that risk aversion is likely to increase. According to data from Tradeweb, the yield on the ten-year German Bund rose by 1.5 basis points to 2.665 percent, while the yield on the ten-year US Treasury bond increased by one basis point to 3.970 percent. Guntermann added that the strong rise in oil prices is expected to have only limited impact on German government bonds, while military strikes by the US and Israel against Iran have boosted demand for safe-haven assets, keeping the yield increase within limits.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 10:16 AM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/der_boersen_tag/Anleiherenditen-im-Euroraum-steigen-Iran-Krieg-schuert-Inflationssorgen-id30420664.html)\n\n**Wall Street Futures Plunge Amid Middle East Escalation and Oil Spike**\nUS stock futures fell by more than 1% on Monday, March 2, 2026, as escalating Middle East conflict triggered a flight to safety ahead of a busy week of US economic data. According to Reuters, the Dow Jones futures dropped 1.39% (-680 points), the S&P 500 futures fell 1.46% (-100.5 points), and the Nasdaq 100 futures declined 1.86% (-464 points) at 02:20 a.m. ET. Oil prices surged, gold rose approximately 2%, and the 10-year US Treasury yield briefly hit its lowest level in 11 months. The market reaction followed continued US and Israeli military strikes against Iran after the weekend attacks that killed Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, prompting missile barrages from Tehran and fears of regional expansion. According to media reports, US President Donald Trump stated the conflict could last four more weeks. The geopolitical shock coincides with upcoming releases of manufacturing PMI data, January retail sales, ADP employment figures, and the non-farm payrolls report. Analysts warn that sustained oil price hikes could reignite inflationary pressures, reducing the likelihood of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates in the short term. Additionally, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recorded their steepest monthly declines since March 2025, while the Dow Jones achieved its tenth consecutive month of gains, its longest streak since January 2018.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 08:01 AM\nSource:[Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/actualites/les-marches-a-terme-de-wall-street-chutent-en-raison-de-l-escalade-du-conflit-au-moyen-orient-0fe234d6797b4c7be13df20a391284a1)\n\n**US Treasury Yields Hit 11-Month Low Amid Escalating Middle East Tensions**\nOn March 2, 2026, during Asian trading hours, US Treasury prices rose as risk-off sentiment spread due to concerns that the Middle East conflict will prolong. According to Reuters, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.9260% in the early Asian session, marking its lowest level in 11 months. The 2-year Treasury yield briefly dropped to 3.3650%, its lowest since August 2022, before recovering slightly. This market movement follows reports that on March 1, Israel launched a new attack on Tehran, the capital of Iran, prompting Iran to retaliate with further missile strikes. A LabBank analyst noted that the yield decline was driven by risk-off sentiment, while also warning that, similar to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the current conflict could become a factor driving inflation.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 02:37 AM\nSource:[\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u7248 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8](https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/headlines/business/2026/03/589087.php)\n\n**U.S.-Israel-Iran Conflict Risks Pushing Up U.S. Treasury Yields and Borrowing Costs**\nOn March 2, 2026, MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2 reported that joint airstrikes by the United States and Israel against Iran, followed by Iran's large-scale retaliation, triggered an immediate market reaction driven by risk-off sentiment and a flight to safety. In the short term, capital has flowed into U.S. Treasury bonds and the U.S. dollar as investors seek safe-haven assets. However, analysts warn that if the conflict prolongs and oil prices surge due to disruptions in Persian Gulf transportation or infrastructure, rising inflation could force global central banks to tighten monetary policy, thereby pushing up nominal interest rates and U.S. Treasury yields. Long-term risks are concentrated in fiscal stability: with U.S. government debt exceeding 122% of GDP as of the end of 2025, sustained military spending could exacerbate fiscal fragility. This may fuel investor concerns regarding the safety of U.S. Treasuries and future supply dynamics, potentially raising borrowing costs. Evaluation agencies caution that a protracted war is more likely to alter structural trends in interest rates and the bond market than temporary market volatility.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 02:01 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx)\n\n**US 10-Year Yield Drops to 17-Month Low Amid Middle East Conflict and Inflation Data**\nOn Monday, March 2, 2026, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note fell to approximately 3.93%, marking its lowest level since September 2024, according to data from InstaForex. This decline occurred as escalating conflict in the Middle East, specifically US and Israeli military strikes on Iran over the weekend that killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and effectively shut the Strait of Hormuz, boosted demand for safe-haven assets. In response, Tehran attacked US assets across the region, heightening concerns about a wider war. Concurrently, data released on Friday indicated that US producer prices rose more than expected in January, suggesting companies are passing higher tariff-related costs to consumers and complicating the Federal Reserve's path toward interest rate cuts. Despite these inflationary pressures, markets are currently pricing in two 25-basis-point interest rate cuts for the year, amid speculation that recent market turmoil could push the Federal Reserve toward a more accommodative stance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 01:03 AM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2917970)\n\n**Middle East Conflict Drives Bond Yields to Multi-Month Lows as Oil Prices Surge**\nEscalating conflict between the US, Israel, and Iran has triggered a flight to safety in global bond markets, driving bond prices up and yields down. On March 2, 2026 (Taiwan time), the US 10-year Treasury yield fell 1 basis point to 3.93%, its lowest since April, while the 5-year yield dropped 2 basis points to 3.48%, its lowest since October 2024. US President Trump stated that US forces would continue bombing Iran until objectives are met, following attacks on hundreds of targets and the assassination of Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei, which has deepened global economic uncertainty. Fears that the conflict could disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz caused Brent crude to surge 13% to over $82 per barrel, its highest since January 2025, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) hovered near $72. The oil price spike has raised inflation expectations, limiting the rally in US Treasury futures. In Japan, the 10-year yield fell 3.5 basis points to 2.075%, while Australia's 3-year and 10-year yields dropped 8 basis points to 4.13% and 6 basis points to 4.59%, respectively. SMBC Nikko Securities senior strategist Atsushi Okamura noted that while markets typically react with a flight to safety followed by a rebound, the assassination of a head of state could trigger longer-term chain reactions. He warned that for Japan, rising oil prices, widening trade deficits, and potential fiscal stimulus to combat purchasing power declines could lead to further upward pressure on long-term and ultra-long-term bond yields.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 12:59 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6811/9353201)\n\n**Investors Brace for Major Negative Reaction to Middle East Conflict Following Death of Iranian Leader**\nAccording to a report published in El Economista on March 1, 2026, investors are bracing for a significant negative reaction as the Middle East conflict has escalated from a marginal risk to the primary global concern. On Saturday, attacks by the United States and Israel killed Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, prompting Iran to attack Gulf cities, which led to flight suspensions and the halting of tanker traffic through the strategic Strait of Hormuz. The primary risk for markets is the uncertainty regarding Iran's future, given the complexity of its Islamic Republic government and the power of its Revolutionary Guard. This situation complicates oil price prospects, which have risen for weeks; Brent crude (LCOc1) has increased by 20% this year, reaching approximately $73 per barrel. Investors have purchased US Treasury bonds and gold (XAU=) as hedges against these risks and the erratic policies of President Donald Trump. Gold has risen 22% in 2026, following a record year in 2025, while the main US stock index (SPX) has risen only 0.5%. Analysts at Barclays warned that markets may be underestimating the risk of a containment failure, noting that history suggests selling geopolitical risk premiums when hostilities begin. They recommended against buying immediately unless the S&P 500 drops more than 10%. William Jackson, Chief Economist for Emerging Markets at Capital Economics, predicts a prolonged conflict could push oil prices to around $100, potentially adding 0.6 to 0.7 percentage points to global inflation. Charles Myers, founder of Signum Global Advisors, stated that markets are prepared for a limited surgical strike but have not priced in a major decapitation attack on the regime. Tariq Dennison of GFM Asset Management noted that inflationary impacts would likely be greater in Europe than in the US due to proximity to oil and gas from Hormuz. Conversely, some analysts, including Goh of Eastspring, noted falling US 10-year bond yields (US10YT=RR) to below 4% and expressed uncertainty about the safety of US Treasuries if oil prices spike and inflation persists.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 04:38 PM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/mercados/inversionistas-preparan-reaccion-negativa-mayor-guerra-oriente-medio-20260301-802118.html)\n\n**US Direct Strike on Iran Escalates Conflict, Raising Oil Price and Market Volatility Risks**\nThe United States has launched its first direct military strike against Iran, escalating geopolitical tensions and shifting market focus from short-term sentiment trading to substantive risks regarding Middle Eastern crude oil supply and transport, according to a March 1, 2026, report by UDN. Large institutional investors warn that while OPEC+ may increase production to mitigate supply shocks, a disruption in Iranian exports or the Strait of Hormuz could cause oil prices and market volatility to significantly exceed the levels seen during the June 2025 Israel-Iran incident. Specifically, Brent crude oil prices could test the $80 per barrel mark in the short term, though global supply remains ample and OPEC+ production hikes may cap long-term gains. In the US stock market, the direct US involvement is expected to amplify the interplay of safe-haven demand, inflation concerns, and growth risks, creating higher short-term downward pressure on equities than last year; high-valuation growth stocks and non-essential consumer discretionary stocks face valuation correction risks, while energy and defense sectors are expected to benefit. Regarding US Treasury bonds, safe-haven support is limited as long-term yields face pressure from inflation premiums; while short-term volatility is expected to increase, the 10-year US Treasury yield is projected to oscillate around 4% without a clear trend, though sustained high oil prices could push long-term yields higher. Economically, the key determinant is whether the situation evolves into a persistent energy and transport crisis; prolonged high oil and shipping costs could re-ignite global commodity inflation and corporate profit pressures, dampening global growth momentum. Consequently, while the market currently anticipates the Federal Reserve's first rate cut in June, rising inflation risks could delay this to the third quarter.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 01:11 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/7251/9351880)\n\n**Treasury yields decline as investors await wholesale inflation reading**\nU.S. Treasury yields declined on Friday, February 27, 2026, as investors awaited the release of the producer price index (PPI), a key measure of wholesale inflation, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast the headline PPI to rise by 0.3% and the core PPI (excluding food and energy) to increase by 0.3%. Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, stated in a note that while the PPI report is unlikely to be a major market mover, it will help shape expectations ahead of the January core-PCE index release on March 13. He emphasized that the Federal Reserve's rate normalization process remains on hold until inflation shows a sustainable return to its 2.0% target, making the PPI data useful for refining investors' views on the inflation environment.

Core CPI, excluding food and energy, fell to 2.5% annually\u2014the lowest since March 2021\u2014supporting expectations that the Federal Reserve may begin lowering interest rates soon. Monthly headline CPI rose 0.2%, below the 0.3% forecast. Energy prices declined 0.1% annually, with gasoline dropping 7.5% and fuel oil falling 4.2%. Food inflation eased to 3.1% annually, with eggs down 7% and pork chops down 4.1% weekly; canned vegetables rose 5.5% monthly. Shelter inflation slowed to 3% from 3.2% in December, and used car and truck prices fell 2% annually. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Nasdaq climbed 0.6% in early trading, while the 10-year Treasury yield hit its lowest intraday level since early December. Despite the cooling inflation, the Fed maintained a cautious stance due to a strong January jobs report and persistent core services inflation. In India, the new CPI series with a 2024 base year (2024=100) was introduced, marking the most significant update since 2012. The new index includes 358 items, reduces the Food & Beverages weight from 45.86% to 36.75%, adds rural housing rent, incorporates e-commerce price data from 12 online markets, and reflects modern consumption patterns. The 20 basis point difference in headline inflation is attributed to methodological changes and the revised basket. Economists at Kotak Mahindra expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to hold rates through 2026, as the new series is expected to yield structurally softer inflation prints within the 2%-6% tolerance band. The next U.S. CPI report, covering February 2026, is scheduled for release on Wednesday, March 11, 2026, at 8:30 AM ET. The October 2025 CPI report was not released due to a federal government shutdown from October 1 to November 12, 2025, which prevented data collection, leading to the use of September\u2019s data for subsequent months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 06:57 PM\nSource:[The Sunday Guardian Live](https://sundayguardianlive.com/business/cpi-report-today-inflation-cools-more-than-expected-in-january-falling-to-24-india-overhauls-index-with-new-2024-base-year-explained-170239/)\n\n**U.S. Inflation Preview: Get Ready For CPI**\nThe U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, scheduled for release on February 14, 2026, at 8:30 A.M. ET, is the final piece of this week\u2019s U.S. economic data puzzle. MarketPulse anticipates that an as-expected CPI reading will prompt stock markets to briefly test recent all-time highs before consolidating. March rate cut odds are projected to rise to around 20%, contingent on subsequent data and market conditions. A CPI beat\u2014higher-than-expected inflation\u2014would likely trigger declines in equities, metals, and cryptocurrencies, push short-end yields higher, strengthen the U.S. dollar, and reduce expectations to just one 2026 rate cut. Conversely, a CPI miss\u2014lower-than-expected inflation\u2014could drive stock indexes to new highs, weaken the U.S. dollar, boost crypto and metals, and increase March rate cut odds above 50%, though sustained rallies would require a significant inflation surprise.

Core CPI fell to 2.6% year-on-year in November, down from 3.0% in October and well below the expected 3%. Due to the government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Labor did not release month-on-month CPI or subcomponent growth rates. The decline was primarily driven by falling rent and transportation goods prices, with a notable increase in the share of CPI subcomponents showing decelerating growth. Despite the strong miss on expectations, the absence of\u73af\u6bd4 data raises concerns about data reliability. Market reaction included lower Treasury yields, a rise in equities, gold peaking then pulling back, and the dollar index dipping before rebounding. The market's expected first rate cut shifted slightly forward from April 2026 to March 2026, though with limited pricing (around 60%). A CPI forecasting model indicates that CPI will decline into 2026, with year-on-year CPI expected to reach 2.8% in December 2025 and fall to approximately 2.4% by March\u2013April 2026. This decline is attributed to falling 'super core CPI' (driven by imported PPI trends), declining rents (despite incomplete data), lower energy prices (with Brent crude forecast at $60\u201370/bbl), and a 0.1%\u20130.2% upward impact from tariffs. The model's predictions for October and November 2025 (2.9% and 2.8%) closely matched actual data. With inflation easing, the Federal Reserve is expected to focus more on 'full employment' in early 2026, likely continuing rate cuts. While the 10-year Treasury yield is supported around 4.1%, economic recovery and potential rebound in December nonfarm payroll data could push it to 4.2%\u20134.3% in the near term. By mid-2026, as rate cuts progress, the yield curve\u2019s central tendency is expected to shift downward.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 21, 2025 06:16 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202512213597554148.html)\n\n**U.S. Bond Yields Rise Amid Slowing Inflation**\nU.S. Treasury bond yields rose slightly on Friday as investors assessed a moderate inflation reading and awaited further economic data before the end of the week. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds increased by 2 basis points to 4.145%, while the 2-year yield rose by 1 basis point to 3.47%, and the 30-year yield rose by 3 basis points to 4.83%. A basis point equals 0.01%. The inverse relationship between bond yields and prices means that higher yields correspond to lower bond prices. Inflation data released Thursday showed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in November, below the 3.1% expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 2.6% year-on-year, below the expected 3%. The slowdown in inflation has given investors some hope that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in 2026. While the likelihood of a rate cut in January remains weak, market participants now assign a 56.8% probability to a cut in March, up from 53.9% on Wednesday. Investors are now turning their attention to the release of November existing-home sales data later in the day.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 19, 2025 12:53 PM\nSource:[Albawaba](https://www.albawabhnews.com/5305461)\n\n**Treasury yields inch higher as investors digest cooler inflation data**\nTreasury yields rose slightly following a lighter-than-expected inflation report: the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% year-over-year in November, below the 3.1% forecast by Dow Jones economists. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, rose 2.6% annually, under the projected 3%. This downward trend in inflation has boosted investor optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in 2026. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, the probability of a rate cut in March rose to 56.8%, up from 53.9% the previous day, while odds for a January cut remain low.

Economists had forecast a 0.4% monthly rise and a 3.1% annual increase. Excluding volatile food and energy components, the core CPI rose 0.2% month-on-month and 3.0% year-on-year, down from 3.1% in August. The report was delayed due to the government shutdown but was released to allow the Social Security Administration to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for 2026. Financial markets reacted positively: S&P 500 E-mini Futures rose 0.59% (39.75 points), U.S. Treasury yields fell (10-year yield down 0.4 bps to 3.985%, 2-year down 2.3 bps to 3.459%), and the U.S. Dollar Index dropped 0.11% to 98.83. Market analysts, including Eric Gerster (Alphacore Wealth Advisory), Wasif Latif (Sarmaya Partners), Mona Mahajan (Edward Jones), Marc Chandler (Bannockburn Capital Markets), Peter Cardillo (Spartan Capital Securities), and Joe Saluzzi (Themis Trading), interpreted the data as supportive of the Federal Reserve\u2019s expected 25-basis-point rate cut next week and reinforced expectations of at least two additional cuts by March 2026. They noted that while inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, core inflation is stable, the labor market remains weak, and the delayed data release due to the government shutdown limits the full picture. Despite the strong market reaction, analysts cautioned that rate cuts are already largely priced in, and the dollar may stabilize after its initial drop.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 01:20 PM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/us-verbraucherpreise-steigen-im-september-weniger-als-erwartet-ce7d5dd9de8ef62c)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on the available news data through March 2, 2026, I cannot provide specific information about the Treasury yield reaction to an inflation release on **March 11, 2026**, as this date is in the future (nine days ahead of the current date). However, I can provide important context regarding the likely nature of this release and recent market dynamics between inflation data and Treasury yields.\n\n**Expected Release on March 11, 2026**\n\nMarch 11, 2026 (a Wednesday) likely corresponds to the scheduled release of the **February 2026 Consumer Price Index (CPI)** data. U.S. inflation reports are typically released in the second week of the month covering the previous month's data.\n\n**Recent Inflation-Treasury Yield Dynamics**\n\nThe market has recently exhibited complex reactions to inflation data, with yields moving based on both the inflation prints themselves and broader risk sentiment:\n\n1. **Hot Producer Inflation Triggered Safe-Haven Flows (March 2, 2026)**\n   On March 2, 2026, hotter-than-expected producer price data showed PPI rising 0.5% in January (versus 0.3% expected), with the annual rate at 2.9% [5]. Rather than selling off on inflation concerns, Treasury prices **rose sharply** as investors sought safety amid stagflation fears and AI-driven labor market disruption concerns. This pushed the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield **down 5.5 basis points to a four-month closing low of 3.96%** [5].\n\n2. **Softer PCE Data Caused Yield Declines (February 2026)**\n   Earlier in February 2026, softer Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data\u2014the Fed's preferred inflation gauge\u2014showed annual inflation slowing to 2.4% in January (down from 2.7% in December) [15]. This below-forecast reading caused the 10-year Treasury yield to drop to **4.05%** as markets increased bets on potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2026 [15].\n\n3. **Geopolitical Factors Complicating Yield Movements**\n   Current Treasury yields are also being heavily influenced by safe-haven demand due to escalating Middle East conflict. On March 2, 2026, U.S.-Israel strikes against Iran and subsequent missile barrages triggered a rush to safety, briefly sending the 10-year Treasury yield to an **11-month low** as bond prices rallied alongside gold and oil [4][6].\n\n**Current Market Expectations**\n\n- **Fed Policy**: Money markets currently price in the first potential rate cut no earlier than June or July 2026, with approximately 60 basis points of total cuts expected for the year [2][11]. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming March 17-18, 2026 meeting [9][15].\n- **Yield Range**: The 10-year Treasury yield has recently traded between 3.96% and 4.08%, with the 2-year yield around 3.42-3.47% [5][12][17].\n- **Inflation Trajectory**: Core inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target (at 2.5-3.1% depending on the measure), with services inflation proving sticky even as goods inflation declines [8][10][13].\n\n**Limitations and Outlook**\n\nWithout access to news from March 11, 2026, I cannot report the actual market reaction. The yield response will depend on:\n- Whether the February CPI data meets, beats, or misses consensus expectations\n- The prevailing geopolitical risk premium at that time\n- Any intervening Federal Reserve communications or policy shifts\n\nIf inflation surprises to the upside, yields could rise on renewed Fed hawkishness; however, if accompanied by risk-off sentiment (as seen on March 2), Treasuries might paradoxically rally even with hot inflation data.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
