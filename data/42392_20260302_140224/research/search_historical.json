It does not contain specific data points, trend analysis, or forecasts. The article is primarily a description of the FRED data series **DGS6MO** (Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 6-Month Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis), which is a **related but distinct series** from the question's target series **DTB6** (6-Month Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate, Discount Basis).\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe article describes the FRED data series **DGS6MO**, published by the **Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US)** as part of the **H.15 Selected Interest Rates** statistical release.\n\n### Key Facts:\n- **Units:** Percent, Not Seasonally Adjusted\n- **Frequency:** Daily\n- **Source:** Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US)\n- **Basis:** Investment Basis (as opposed to Discount Basis used in DTB6)\n- For further methodology details, the series notes refer users to the **H.15 Statistical Release notes** and the **Treasury Yield Curve Methodology** documentation\n- Data is subject to revision and can be retrieved with either automatic updates or static time frames\n\nNo specific numerical data points, trend information, or forecasts are provided in the article.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_bill_rates&field_tdr_date_value=2026\">\n## Summary of Article: Treasury Rate Methodology and Series Notes\n\nThis article is primarily a **technical reference document** from the U.S. Treasury explaining the methodology and history behind various Treasury rate series. Key points relevant to the DTB6 (6-Month Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate) question include:\n\n### Daily Treasury Bill Rates (Most Relevant)\n- These rates represent **daily secondary market quotations** on the most recently auctioned Treasury Bills across maturity tranches, including the **26-week (6-month)** bill\n- Market quotations are obtained at approximately **3:30 PM each business day** by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n- The **Bank Discount rate** (the basis for DTB6) is calculated based on par value, amount of discount, and a **360-day year**\n- The Coupon Equivalent (Bond Equivalent/Investment Yield) is an alternative measure based on a 365/366-day year\n\n### Treasury Par Yield Curve (CMT) Notes\n- CMT yields are interpolated from daily par yield curves using a **monotone convex spline method**\n- Inputs are indicative bid-side prices from the most recently auctioned nominal Treasury securities\n- Negative yields are technically possible but the CMT series is **floored at zero**\n\n### No Current Rate Data Provided\nThe article contains **no specific numerical rate values** for the 6-month T-bill as of any recent date, nor any forward-looking rate projections.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T6MFFM\">\n**Disclaimer:** The article content appears to be largely repetitive metadata/boilerplate from the FRED database rather than a substantive analytical article. The extracted content is limited in informational depth.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: 6-Month Treasury Constant Maturity Minus Federal Funds Rate (T6MFFM)\n\n**Source:** Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED), under the *Interest Rate Spreads* release.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n- **Series:** T6MFFM \u2014 \"6-Month Treasury Constant Maturity Minus Federal Funds Rate\"\n- **Units:** Percent, Not Seasonally Adjusted\n- **Frequency:** Monthly\n- **Calculation Methodology:** The series represents the **spread** between two underlying FRED series:\n  - 6-Month Treasury Constant Maturity rate (series: GS6M)\n  - Effective Federal Funds Rate (series: FEDFUNDS)\n\n**Relevance to DTB6 Question:**\nThis series is a *related but distinct* measure from DTB6. While DTB6 tracks the 6-Month Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate on a discount basis (daily frequency), T6MFFM tracks the spread between the 6-month constant maturity rate and the federal funds rate on a monthly basis. The article provides no specific data points or forecasts relevant to the March 2026 resolution date.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/\">\n## Summary of Federal Reserve H.15 Selected Interest Rates (Daily)\n\n**Source:** Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (federalreserve.gov), H.15 Selected Interest Rates release\n\n### Key Data Point for DTB6 (6-Month Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate, Discount Basis):\n\n| Date | 6-Month T-Bill Rate |\n|------|-------------------|\n| Feb 20, 2026 | 3.52% |\n| Feb 23, 2026 | 3.53% |\n| Feb 24, 2026 | 3.53% |\n| Feb 25, 2026 | 3.53% |\n| Feb 26, 2026 | 3.53% |\n\n### Broader Context from the Same Table:\n- **Federal funds effective rate** held steady at **3.64%** across all five days shown\n- **Bank prime loan rate** remained constant at **6.75%**\n- **Discount window primary credit rate** held at **3.75%**\n- **3-month T-bill (secondary market):** Consistently at **3.60%**\n- **1-year T-bill (secondary market):** Ranged between **3.37\u20133.39%**\n\n### Methodological Notes:\n- Rates are annualized using a **360-day year** (discount basis)\n- Data is sourced from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve\n- The 6-month T-bill rate showed minimal movement, stabilizing at **3.53%** for four consecutive days through Feb 26, 2026\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Compute 10-day ahead absolute and signed changes in DTB6 from 2010-01-01 to 2026-02-28; tabulate mean, std-dev, 25th/75th percentiles, and max moves.  Also retrieve conditional distributions around FOMC weeks and CPI-release weeks.  Provide results in a summary table.\nThe documentation returned by the new web search does three things:\n\n1. It reconfirms that the raw inputs requested in the original query are readily obtainable.\n\n\u2022 Complete DTB6 history \u2013 The FRED time-series \u201cDTB6: 6-Month Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate, Discount Basis\u201d is continuously available from 1958-12-09 through at least 2026-02-26, the last observation displayed at 3.53 percent (FRED, series DTB6 \u2013 already cited in the previous memo).\n\n\u2022 FOMC event calendar \u2013 The Board of Governors keeps a year-by-year archive of every two-day FOMC meeting. For example, the \u201cFOMC historical 2010\u201d page lists the 2010 meetings (Federalreserve.gov, fomchistorical2010.htm). Parallel pages exist for every subsequent year up to 2026, so all meeting dates needed to flag \u201cFOMC weeks\u201d are available.\n\n\u2022 CPI release calendar \u2013 The Bureau of Labor Statistics maintains an archive of news-release pages for each CPI report. The hit returned for 14 April 2010 (BLS CPI release 2010-04-14) and the analogous pages for 2010-06-17, 2010-08-13, etc. demonstrate that the exact release dates are preserved for every month (BLS, news.release archives). These dates can therefore be mapped to \u201cCPI-release weeks.\u201d\n\n2. It supplies no new numerical work: none of the pages calculates 10-trading-day DTB6 changes or their descriptive moments. No table of means, standard deviations, quartiles, or maxima\u2014unconditional or conditional on event weeks\u2014appears in the material retrieved.\n\n3. It therefore leaves the same single information gap identified earlier: the mechanical computation of the statistics requested by the client.\n\n   \u2022 What is still missing?  \n     \u2013 For each trading day t between 2010-01-04 and 2026-02-28 (2010-01-01 is a holiday), one must compute  \n       \u039410 t = DTB6 t+10 \u2013 DTB6 t (signed change) and |\u039410 t| (absolute change), where \u201ct+10\u201d is defined as the tenth subsequent trading day in the DTB6 calendar.  \n     \u2013 Using those two vectors, derive five descriptive measures\u2014mean, standard deviation, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and maximum\u2014under three sampling rules: (a) all days, (b) days that fall in an \u201cFOMC week\u201d (Monday-Friday containing an FOMC meeting), and (c) days that fall in a \u201cCPI-release week.\u201d\n\n   \u2022 Why can\u2019t we finish the job with the information in hand?  \n     \u2013 None of the search results offers those pre-calculated transformations; all they provide is the source data and documentation.  \n     \u2013 Consequently the summary table demanded by the original query is still empty.\n\nConclusion  \nAll external data prerequisites are fully satisfied: the DTB6 price path, every FOMC meeting date, and every CPI public-release date are publicly posted in stable HTML or CSV formats (FRED; Federalreserve.gov; BLS, news.release archives). What remains to be delivered is purely computational. Without running the DTB6 series through a 10-day difference filter and tabulating the required statistics, the client\u2019s question\u2014\u201cCompute 10-day ahead absolute and signed changes in DTB6 \u2026 and provide results in a summary table\u201d\u2014cannot yet be answered. No additional conceptual research is necessary; only execution of the calculations is outstanding.</Agent_report>\n\n\n<FREDData series=\"DTB6\" query=\"DTB6\">\nFRED Economic Data: 6-Month Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate, Discount Basis\nSeries ID: DTB6\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily\nLatest observation: 3.53 (2026-02-26)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=3.85, min=3.48, max=4.17\n- 5-year: mean=3.37, min=0.02, max=5.36\n- 10-year: mean=2.28, min=0.02, max=5.36\n- All-time: mean=4.48, min=0.02, max=15.93 (since 1958-12-09)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.00 (+0.0%)\n- 3-month change: -0.13 (-3.6%)\n- 6-month change: -0.33 (-8.5%)\n- Year-over-year: 3.53 vs 4.17 (-15.3%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily):\nDate,Value\n2026-02-10,3.50\n2026-02-11,3.51\n2026-02-12,3.50\n2026-02-13,3.50\n2026-02-17,3.51\n2026-02-18,3.51\n2026-02-19,3.52\n2026-02-20,3.52\n2026-02-23,3.53\n2026-02-24,3.53\n2026-02-25,3.53\n2026-02-26,3.53\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
