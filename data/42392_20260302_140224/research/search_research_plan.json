  "plan_analysis": "We already know the series ID (DTB6), its definition, frequency, unit, and that the last reported value (as of 2026-02-26) is 3.53 percent.  A forecaster still needs:\n\n1. Base-rate/volatility context: How much does DTB6 usually move over the course of 10 days?  What have typical 6-month bill rates been in similar monetary-policy environments?\n2. Resolution details: How quickly the FRED \u201cDTB6\u201d series is published, whether same-day or with a one-day lag, and whether revisions are common.\n3. Key drivers:\n   \u2022 Federal-funds-rate expectations and the schedule of the next FOMC meeting.  \n   \u2022 Upcoming macro releases (most importantly the CPI on 2026-03-11) that can swing front-end yields.  \n   \u2022 6-month Treasury bill auctions (weekly, Monday 11:30 ET) whose stop-out rate is a very strong contemporaneous anchor for DTB6.\n4. Current state: Latest live market quotes for the 6-month bill, most recent auction results, current expectations for March CPI and FOMC, and news on any surprises (e.g., banking-sector stress) that could abruptly move short-term rates.\n5. Contrarian check: Evidence of sudden spikes or collapses in the 6-month yield during past data shocks, policy surprises, or liquidity events.\n\nThe search strategy therefore includes:\n\u2022 Pulling the full DTB6 history to compute recent volatility and conditional distributions.  \n\u2022 Identifying spreads vs. fed-funds and SOFR as explanatory variables.  \n\u2022 Gathering real-time quotes and auction data for the current level.  \n\u2022 Scanning financial news for anything that might shift expectations in the coming ten days (FOMC guidance leaks, CPI consensus changes, fiscal headlines, geopolitical shocks).",
