**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Historical base rate (55.3%):** 2,506 overlapping windows of DD 9-day returns. Directly applicable, large sample. This is the primary anchor.
- **Ex-dividend date March 2:** The $0.20 dividend is already reflected in the March 2 close price (baseline). This is mechanically neutral going forward - no systematic bias introduced.
- **52-week range context:** DD at ~$50 vs range $22.50-$52.66. However, the $22.50 low is an artifact of the $47.50 special dividend in November 2025. The "true" range likely reflects DD trading from ~$35-40 post-dividend to $52.66 high. This means DD is genuinely near its recent highs, which historically correlates with slightly lower forward returns (50.1% conditional).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Strong 3-month momentum (+29.69%, 94th percentile):** Conditional base rate 58.5% (N=236). This is a meaningful upward adjustment.
- **Analyst consensus "Moderate Buy" with average PT ~$51.86-$56.12:** Multiple independent analysts (Citigroup $59, Deutsche Bank $58, Jefferies $59, KeyCorp $57, Wells Fargo $55) suggest 10-18% upside from current levels. This is a moderate positive signal but analysts are often slow to update and targets span 6-12 months.
- **$2B buyback program (~12.2% of shares):** Provides price support. Moderate positive signal.
- **High 30-day realized volatility (34.9% annualized):** Conditional base rate 57.2%. Positive but modest.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Broad market context (S&P fell 0.86% in Feb 2026):** Slightly negative but not DD-specific.
- **Midterm year seasonality:** Historically weak but not strongly predictive for 9-day windows.
- **Institutional buying/selling mix:** Multiple small increases offset by some reductions (Primecap -8%, Allianz -32.9%). Net neutral.
- **No major catalysts identified:** No earnings, no major contracts, no litigation news within the March 2-13 window. This supports status quo continuation.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The prediction window is 9 trading days (March 2-13, 2026). 

**If halved (~4-5 trading days):** The base rate for positive returns over shorter windows is typically lower (closer to 50-52%), as mean reversion and noise dominate. I would lower my estimate to ~53-54%.

**If doubled (~18 trading days):** The base rate for positive returns over longer windows is typically higher (closer to 57-60%), as the positive drift of equities compounds. I would raise my estimate to ~57-58%.

The 9-day window is relatively short, meaning noise dominates over fundamental factors. The CPI release (~March 10) adds a macro catalyst that could move markets in either direction, but historically CPI surprises don't systematically favor one direction.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting point:** 55.3% unconditional base rate.

**Adjustments:**

1. **Strong 3-month momentum (+29.69%):** +3.2pp → 58.5% conditional rate. This is the strongest positive signal. Momentum tends to persist over short windows.

2. **Price near top of 52-week range:** The conditional rate is 50.1% (-5.2pp). However, I discount this significantly because the 52-week low of $22.50 is an artifact of the $47.50 special dividend, not a true market low. The "real" 52-week range for DD's operating performance is roughly $35-$52.66. At ~$50, DD is near but not at its all-time recent high ($52.66 on Feb 12). I apply only ~-2pp adjustment.

3. **High volatility (34.9% annualized):** +1.9pp → 57.2% conditional rate. Modest positive.

4. **Prior 5-day return negative (-0.73%):** ~0pp adjustment (55.3% conditional, essentially neutral).

5. **No major catalysts in window:** The absence of earnings, major contracts, or litigation news suggests the status quo (recent upward trend) is more likely to continue than reverse. Mild positive.

6. **Analyst consensus with significant upside ($51.86-$56.12 average PT vs ~$50 current):** Provides mild fundamental support. Moderate positive.

7. **Broad market uncertainty (S&P fell in Feb 2026, tariff concerns):** Mild negative, -1pp.

**Net adjustment:** +3.2 - 2.0 + 1.9 + 0 + 0.5 + 0.5 - 1.0 = +3.1pp

**Inside view estimate:** 55.3% + 3.1% ≈ 58.4%

I'll moderate this slightly to ~57% given that multiple conditional factors don't add linearly and the overall market uncertainty in early 2026. The stock has already had a strong run (+29.69% in 3 months) and is near recent highs, which creates some mean-reversion risk even if the momentum signal is positive.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view gives 56.2%, and my inside view analysis converges to approximately 57%. The key factors are:
- Strong 3-month momentum (genuine, not distorted) → positive
- Near recent highs (partially distorted by special dividend) → mild negative
- High volatility → mild positive
- No specific catalysts in window → neutral/mild positive (status quo continuation)
- Analyst consensus with upside → mild positive
- Market uncertainty → mild negative

Final estimate: **57%**

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria:** Will DD's close price on March 13, 2026 be higher than its close price on March 2, 2026? 9 trading days.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 55.3% unconditional; adjusted to ~56-58% with applicable conditionals.

3. **Consistency check:** "57 out of 100 times, DD closes higher on March 13 than March 2." This is consistent with a slightly above-random outcome for a stock with positive momentum and analyst support but near recent highs.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - Historical 9-day positive return rate: 55.3% (N=2,506) ✓ Factual
   - 3-month momentum +29.69% → conditional 58.5% ✓ Factual
   - Near 52-week high (distorted by special dividend) → conditional 50.1% ✓ Factual, but distortion acknowledged
   - Analyst average PT $51.86-$56.12 vs current ~$50 ✓ Multiple sources confirm
   - No major catalysts in window ✓ Confirmed by news search

5. **Blind spot:** A sudden macro shock (tariff escalation, CPI surprise, broader market selloff) could easily push DD down 3-5% in this window, making my ~57% estimate look too high. The S&P 500 fell 0.86% in February 2026, suggesting some market fragility. If this scenario materializes, the true probability might be closer to 50-52%.

6. **Status quo:** DD has been trading in the $49.70-$51.07 range in late February 2026. The status quo suggests modest continuation near current levels. Given the slight downward drift in the last 5 days (-0.73%), the status quo nudge is slightly negative, suggesting I shouldn't be too aggressive above 57%.

Probability: 57%
