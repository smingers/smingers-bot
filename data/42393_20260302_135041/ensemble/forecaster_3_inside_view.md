Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution criteria  
This resolves “Yes” if DD’s close on 2026-03-13 is strictly higher than DD’s close on 2026-03-02 (both as reported by Yahoo Finance).

(a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; fact vs opinion)
- Programmatic stock-return distribution (historical DD prices; computed stats): High-quality, directly on-point. Factual base rates for 9-trading-day returns and conditional slices (momentum, vol, 52-week position). Most weight.
- MarketBeat “instant alert” roundups (Feb 11 / Feb 17 / Feb 27) and DefenseWorld (Mar 1): Mostly automated aggregation of (i) analyst PT/rating changes, (ii) earnings headline beat, (iii) buyback authorization, (iv) some institutional/insider flows. Mixed quality: underlying items are often factual, but the narrative framing (“expected to rise”) is opinionated and not strongly predictive over 9 trading days.
- GuruFocus ETF/fund activity snippets (Mar 1): Factual that small entities bought shares, but these are tiny flows and not strong short-horizon predictors.
- Seeking Alpha earnings transcript/presentation placeholders (Feb 10): Credible primary-event reference (earnings call happened; guidance discussed), but the provided summaries here contain limited extractable, quantified new information beyond what other sources already state.
- Nasdaq options article (DD March 2026 options begin trading): Low reliability for this question due to a major internal inconsistency (it references DD trading around ~$76.54, far from ~$50 now). I treat this as not usable for direction.
- Stockpulse “trades unchanged” blurbs (Feb 6–Feb 27): Lightweight factual price/volume recaps plus generic sector commentary; minimal incremental forecasting value.
- AskNews “Deep Research” + other AskNews hits: Mostly (i) generic market-research mentions of DuPont as a participant, (ii) unrelated items, (iii) a calendar note (macro events through Mar 13). Little DD-specific catalyst content; useful mainly to confirm “no major litigation/contract bombshell noticed.”

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- Historical base rate for DD over the exact 9-trading-day horizon: P(up)=55.3% (N=2506). This is the best anchor for a short window dominated by noise.
- Current regime: elevated realized volatility (30-day vol ~34.9% annualized). This supports “either direction is plausible,” not a clear directional push, but historically this conditional slice is modestly more “up” (57.2%).

Moderate evidence
- Strong recent momentum: 3-month return +29.7% (94th percentile historically). Conditional base rate when 3-month return >20% is P(up)=58.5% (N=236): a moderate upward nudge.
- Price near recent highs / potential consolidation: “Top decile of 52-week range” slice shows P(up)=50.1%. This would be a moderate downward nudge, but I discount it somewhat because the 52-week range is distorted by the large special dividend in Nov 2025 (making the “low” mechanically very low). Still, practically, DD is near resistance (close to ~$52.66 high), so some mean-reversion/consolidation risk remains.
- Fundamentals/sentiment backdrop: multiple analysts raised PTs (roughly low/mid $50s up to high $50s) and the company has a sizable buyback authorization. These are supportive, but largely “known/slow-moving” and not reliably predictive over just ~2 weeks.

Weak evidence
- Small institutional trades (ETF buys, small fund adds) and insider selling months ago: too small/timed too far away to matter for a 9-trading-day move.
- Macro calendar (e.g., CPI around Mar 10): could create a sharp move, but direction is not knowable ex ante; mostly increases variance rather than mean.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Window length: 2026-03-02 close to 2026-03-13 close = 9 trading days (~11 calendar days).
- If the horizon were halved (~4–5 trading days), I’d move closer to 50/50 because micro-noise dominates even more.
- If the horizon were doubled (~18 trading days), I’d lean slightly more positive than today’s call because momentum + buyback/analyst drift tend to show up more over longer horizons than 2 weeks (though still modest).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside-view anchor (given): 56.2% “Yes”.

Adjustments:
- Upward: strong 3-month momentum (historically +3pp-ish); elevated vol regime historically slightly “up”; generally constructive analyst posture and buyback authorization add mild background support.
- Downward: stock is near its recent peak zone (~$52.66), and after a very strong 1–3 month run (1-month +12%, 3-month +30%), short-horizon consolidation is common; plus macro event risk (CPI) can cut either way, and in such windows winners can retrace.

Net: the positives and negatives largely offset. Given (i) the short horizon, (ii) the “near-highs” consolidation risk, and (iii) that many bullish fundamentals are already in the price after the recent run-up, I shade slightly below the 56.2% outside-view number, but not by much.

Probability calibration
- Status quo / drift assumption: absent new DD-specific news, the best guess is a slight upward drift with high noise, i.e., only modestly above 50%.
- I interpret a ±10% swing as very material here; I do not see enough DD-specific new information to justify moving to (say) 65%+ or down to 45%-. Most “signal” is generic (momentum vs. near-high mean reversion).

Final inside-view probability: 55%.

Checklist:
1) Criteria: “Yes” if DD close on 2026-03-13 > DD close on 2026-03-02 (Yahoo Finance closes).  
2) Outside view base rate used: 56.2% (built from 55.3% unconditional + conditionals).  
3) Consistency line: 55 out of 100 times, DD’s 3/13 close is higher than its 3/2 close.  
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - 9-trading-day historical base rate P(up)=55.3% (strong anchor).
   - 3-month momentum very strong; conditional P(up)=58.5% when >20%.
   - Near-recent-high region (practical resistance/mean reversion risk) dampens upside odds.
   - No identified DD-specific shock catalysts in the window; macro (CPI) adds variance, not clear mean.
5) Blind spot: A large market-wide risk-on/risk-off move (e.g., CPI surprise) could dominate DD idiosyncratics; a strong risk-off shock would make a “No” much more likely.  
6) Status quo outcome: modestly more likely up than down, but only slightly, given short horizon and recent run.

Probability: 55%
