**Analyzing probability for DD forecast**

I'm looking at the probability for DD to close higher on 3/13 compared to 3/2, with a base rate of 56.2%. There aren’t any major catalysts, and the recent strong momentum may face resistance. The upcoming macro CPI report on 3/10 could impact markets, and while analyst upgrades are positive, they’re already priced in. Considering the ex-dividend date today, I think the probability might be slightly lower, settling around 55%. I'll provide a detailed analysis with sources.**Evaluating article quality for Nasdaq options**

I need to address a questionable article about Nasdaq options with noted price discrepancies, which seems to be of low quality. It's generated by Marketbeat and Defenseworld, while Asknews appears largely irrelevant. So, I think the best move is to craft a response using the requested structure and checklist. I want to ensure that my reply is clear and points out these concerns effectively. Let's focus on making it informative!
