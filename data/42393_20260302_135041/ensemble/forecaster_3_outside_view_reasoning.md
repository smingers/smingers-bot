**Analyzing probabilities for returns**

I'm looking at the outside view, starting with a base probability of 55.3% for an upturn. When applying conditions like a 3-month return above 20%, it increases to 58.5%. However, being in the top decile for the past 52 weeks brings it down to 50.1%. After considering various adjustments, I estimate a final probability around 54.9%. It's tricky, with factors like ex-dividends possibly affecting outcomes, but I need to maintain a cautious approach.
