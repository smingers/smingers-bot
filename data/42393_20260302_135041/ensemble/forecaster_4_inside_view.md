Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (quality, fact vs opinion)
• Programmatic “STOCK RETURN DISTRIBUTION” (2 Mar 26). 100 % factual, transparent code; large sample (N = 2 506). Best outside-view anchor.  
• MarketBeat analyst-round-up articles (11 Feb, 17 Feb, 27 Feb 26). Factual on earnings, guidance, price targets; opinions credited to named sell-side firms – moderate reliability.  
• GuruFocus / Defense-World institutional-flow notes (1 Mar 26). Hard SEC numbers; factual but micro in size – weak directional signal.  
• Stockpulse daily price recaps (18 Feb – 1 Mar 26). Pure price/volume facts – establish recent momentum; no opinion.  
• OpenPR/market-research pieces (2 Mar 26 etc.). Generic industry positioning; no short-horizon price information – negligible weight.  
• Dividend-date confirmations (Simply Wall St, MarketBeat) – factual; confirm ex-div date 2 Mar 26.  
No source provided a speculative rumour or un-attributed claim that would carry large weight.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighing)
Strong:
1. Historical base rate: DD up 55.3 % of the time over any 9-trading-day window (N = 2 506).  
Moderate:
2. Momentum: +30 % 3-mo return; similar historical windows show 58.5 % up-frequency (+3 pp).  
3. $2 bn (≈ 12 %) authorised buy-back announced Nov 25 and ongoing – structural bid; persists through window.  
4. Cluster of analyst target raises in Feb – Mar signalling improving sentiment (KeyCorp, UBS, Citi, Deutsche, Mizuho, Jefferies; all $52–$59).  
Weak:
5. Stock is in top decile of 52-wk range; historically marginally mean-reverting (up-frequency falls to 50.1 %, −5 pp).  
6. Ex-div already reflected in 2 Mar close; any post-ex-div drift is historically tiny (<0.3 pp edge on similar chemicals names).  
7. Macro prints (non-farm payrolls 6 Mar, CPI 10 Mar) introduce two-sided volatility – direction unclear.

Net qualitative tilt: the bullish momentum/buy-back/analyst cluster adds a few points; near-high mean reversion subtracts a few – roughly offsetting, so we stay close to the unconditional base.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution in 9 trading days (11 calendar days). If horizon were halved (≈4 days) price noise dominates; I would shrink toward 52 %. If doubled (≈18 days) momentum persistence has more room; I would edge up to ~57–58 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Start at 55.3 % (outside view).  
+1 pp: ongoing aggressive buy-back (structural demand).  
+1 pp: cluster of recent upgrades/raised guidance reinforces sentiment; such bursts historically add ≈1 pp over a fortnight.  
−1 pp: price sitting near 52-wk high implies slightly elevated pull-back risk.  
Net: +1 pp → 56.3 %.  Because short-horizon stock moves are almost random, I cap confidence well below 60 %.

Inside-view probability = 56 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in roughly 56 out of 100 similar 9-trading-day windows following the observed set-up, DD will finish above the 2 Mar 26 close.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will DD close higher on 13 Mar 26 than on 2 Mar 26 (inclusive of split-adjustments)?”  
2. Outside-view base rate used: 55.3 %.  
3. Consistency line: “57? 56? out of 100 times, price ends higher” – yes, in line with justification.  
4. Key evidence (≤ 20 words each):  
   • Historical 55 % up-frequency over 9-day windows.  
   • +30 % 3-mo momentum; slight persistence.  
   • $2 bn buy-back continues, supporting demand.  
   • Wave of analyst price-target increases Feb 26.  
   • Price in top decile of 52-wk range (mild mean-reversion).  
5. Blind-spot: An unexpected macro shock (e.g., weak CPI -> rate spike) hits cyclicals; could drop probability to <40 %.  
6. Status-quo drift: short horizon, equity moves near-random; slight lean to “up” only.

Probability: 56%
