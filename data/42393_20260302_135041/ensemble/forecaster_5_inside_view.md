Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
1. Programmatic historical‐distribution block (compiled 2026-03-02).  Raw price data drawn from Yahoo Finance; very high quality, no opinions.  
2. MarketBeat analyst-round-up articles (11 Feb, 17 Feb, 27 Feb).  Factual on ratings/targets/dividend dates; light commentary from named brokerages (Wells Fargo, KeyBanc, UBS, etc.). Reliable for the facts but forward opinions (“overweight”, price targets) are moderately biased and medium quality.  
3. GuruFocus/Defense-World institutional-flow notes (1 Mar).  SEC-filed 13F data; reliable for share counts, weak for short-horizon price direction.  
4. Stockpulse automated price tickers (17 Feb–2 Mar).  Pure price/volume statistics; usable as factual context.  
5. AskNews sweep (2 Mar).  Mostly market-research press releases listing DuPont as a “key player”; no actionable near-term information → very weak.  
Overall, only (1) supplies statistically-grounded evidence relevant to a nine-day move; (2)–(5) supply sentiment colour with little short-term predictive value.

(b)  Evidence analysis  
• Strong evidence  
  – Historical base rate: DD rose over 55 % of 2 506 overlapping 9-day windows (source 1).  
• Moderate evidence  
  – $0.20/share quarterly dividend went ex-dividend 2 Mar; reference price therefore already “ex-gap” adjusted, making the hurdle ≈ 0.4 % easier to clear (sources 2).  
  – Momentum: +12 % 1-mo, +30 % 3-mo returns; conditional base rate when 3-mo > 20 % shows P(up)=58.5 % (+3.2 pp, source 1).  
• Weak evidence  
  – Price in top decile of 52-wk range historically trims win-rate by −5 pp.  
  – Macro/CPI headline risk next week; direction hard to sign.

Net qualitative weighting: one solid upward tilt (ex-div gap), one solid baseline (history), two small opposing nudges (momentum+, overbought−), one small negative macro tail risk. No coherent cluster of strong bearish signals.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in exactly 9 NYSE sessions (today through 13 Mar 2026).  
• If the window were halved to ~4 days the random component dominates; I would shade probability toward 52 %.  
• If doubled to ~18 days drift and buyback support matter more; I would edge up toward ~57 – 58 %.

(d)  Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view anchor: 55.3 %.  
Adjustments:  
+2 pp   Easier hurdle because 2 Mar close is ex-dividend.  
−2 pp  “Price at 52-wk high” mean-reversion tendency.  
+1 pp   Momentum conditional.  
−1 pp   Macro/CPI event risk.  
= 55 %.  
Given the short horizon and DD’s 35 %-annualised realized vol, any single factor rarely moves win-probability by more than a few percentage points; thus I keep the forecast close to the statistically-derived base.

Probability calibration
“I expect that in about 55 out of 100 similar 9-day periods, DD will finish higher than the 2 Mar 2026 close.”

Checklist:
1. Restatement – “Between the 2 Mar and 13 Mar 2026 closes, will DD end higher? ”  
2. Outside view = 55.3 % (DD’s own 9-day history).  
3. Consistency line written above.  
4. Key evidence (≤ 20 w each):  
   • DD rises 55 % of 9-day windows historically.  
   • Ex-div gap lowers hurdle by ≈ 0.4 %.  
   • 3-month +30 % momentum historically modestly bullish.  
   • Trading near 52-wk high slightly bearish via mean-reversion.  
   • CPI report within window adds symmetric volatility, small net risk.  
5. Blind-spot – Sudden chemicals sector sell-off (e.g., profit-warning from peer) inside window could cut price >5 %, crushing the forecast.  
6. Status-quo outcome is essentially a coin-flip; a slight nudge toward “Yes” is justified but large movement isn’t.

Probability: 55%
