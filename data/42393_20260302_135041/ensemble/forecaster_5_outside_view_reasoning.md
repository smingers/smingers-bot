**Analyzing prediction probabilities**

I'm working on predicting the probability that DD's closing price on March 13, 2026, will be higher than its closing price on March 2, 2026, over a timeframe of nine trading days. Here, I need to focus on an external perspective, relying mostly on historical patterns rather than specific news. Typically, outside views reference historical data, so I'll assess sources like Yahoo Finance and Simply Wall St while choosing relevant reference classes like 9-day window returns for DD and the S&P 500.**Reviewing prediction adjustments**

I'm focusing on nine trading-day windows for DD's historical returns as a basis. I need to justify this timeframe by analyzing historical volatility. Starting with an unconditional 55.3% probability, I’ll adjust for factors like the price being in the top decile of its 52-week range, which lowers the probability slightly. Accounting for other factors, I estimate a net adjustment that keeps the probability around 55%. 

Considering the ex-dividend price drop, this might actually increase the chance of exceeding the baseline, given the typical recovery patterns. I could anticipate a final probability close to 56%.**Adjusting outside view probability**

I’m considering that the outside view might start with a 55% baseline, but I can adjust it slightly higher due to the recent ex-dividend drop, which impacted the morning price. Even though the closing price reflects that drop, I think there might be some mean reversion, potentially raising the probability by 1-2 percentage points. So I'll set the outside view probability at 57%. Now, I should summarize each source to explain this adjustment clearly.
