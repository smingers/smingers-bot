  "plan_analysis": "The pre-research materials already give (a) today\u2019s reference close, (b) a statistically-sound unconditional and conditional 9-day base rate for DD, and (c) a snapshot of current fundamentals plus a couple of recent news bullets.  \nWhat\u2019s still missing for a well-rounded forecast:\n\n1. Finer-grained historical patterns that could matter now:  \n   \u2022 DD\u2019s typical price action around ex-dividend dates (the ex-dividend is 2026-03-02, exactly our reference day).  \n   \u2022 Seasonality for the Materials/Chemicals space in early-March.  \n   \u2022 DD\u2019s beta/ correlation to the S&P 500 to translate any macro view into a DD view.  \n   \u2022 Performance during macro data weeks that will hit before resolution (e.g., CPI on Mar-10)\u2014these can move cyclicals/materials.\n\n2. Clarification of the resolution source/mechanism is already covered (Yahoo Finance close).\n\n3. Current catalysts/risks between now and Mar-13:  \n   \u2022 Fresh analyst rating/target changes, especially straight after the earnings season.  \n   \u2022 Any new corporate actions, contract wins/losses, litigation, or regulatory headlines.  \n   \u2022 Options market pricing (implied vol and skew) for the Mar-13 weekly expiration, which contains traders\u2019 aggregate probability beliefs.  \n   \u2022 Sector-wide flows or macro shocks (e.g., commodity price swings, Fed commentary, geopolitics).\n\n4. Contrarian checks: look for negative headlines (lawsuits, downgrades) or broad-market risk-off signals that could cause a short-term drop.\n\nThe eight queries below are designed to fill those gaps: five historical-oriented to enrich the reference class, and three current-oriented to surface fresh catalysts and market sentiment.",
