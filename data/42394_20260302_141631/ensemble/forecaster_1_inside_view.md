## Analysis

### (a) Source Analysis

**CBS News Live Updates (Mar 2, 2026):** High-quality, reliable source. Reports Khamenei killed, US-Israeli military operations ongoing, regional escalation. Factual reporting of major geopolitical events. This is the day the question opens — confirming the extraordinary context.

**Local10/AP (Mar 1, 2026):** Reliable wire service. Confirms Khamenei death, Iran forming leadership council, conflict widening. Factual reporting consistent with CBS News.

**Republic World (Mar 2, 2026):** Moderate quality. Reports Pahlavi's Fox News interview describing strikes as "game changer." Quotes are attributed to Pahlavi directly — factual as to what he said.

**WFTV (Feb 27, 2026):** Reliable. Reports tensions between Pahlavi and Kurdish dissidents. Expert opinion from Mehrzad Boroujerdi (named, credible academic) noting Trump declined to meet Pahlavi personally. Factual with credible expert opinion.

**BSS/AFP (Mar 1, 2026):** High quality (AFP wire). Reports Pahlavi urging street protests following Khamenei's death. Factual.

**The Forward (Feb 28, 2026):** Reliable publication. Detailed profile with named pollster (Ammar Maleki) citing ~1/3 Iranian support. Mix of facts and analysis.

**AskNews Articles (various dates):** Multiple sources from Jan-Mar 2026 confirming Pahlavi's intensive media presence. Key: CBS 60 Minutes appearance (Mar 1-2), Fox News appearances (Mar 1-2), Washington Post op-ed (Mar 1). These are high-quality, independently confirming sources.

**Deep Research Analysis:** Synthesizes multiple sources. Notes Pahlavi appeared on 60 Minutes, Fox News multiple times, published WaPo op-ed around March 1-2. Also notes controversy about bot accounts inflating digital support — relevant for assessing whether organic search interest is genuine.

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence for Decreases:**

1. **Google Trends value already at 100 on March 1** (the day before the question window opens). Within the Feb 9-Mar 11 fixed window, March 1 represents the absolute peak. March 2 will be at or near peak; March 11 will almost certainly be lower as the initial shock fades. This is a direct structural constraint — values at 100 can only go down or stay the same within the same window. *Strong evidence.*

2. **Multiple independent sources confirm the triggering event (Khamenei death + US-Israeli strikes) occurred on Feb 28-Mar 1** — i.e., *before* the question window starts. The peak of search interest for such events typically occurs within 24-48 hours of the event, meaning March 1-2 is likely the peak, with March 11 being well past the initial spike. Historical pattern for breaking news events on Google Trends: sharp spike followed by rapid decline. *Strong evidence.*

3. **60 Minutes appearance on March 1** (confirmed by CBS News and AskNews) is a one-time event that drives a spike. Such TV appearances cause 1-3 day spikes, not sustained 9-day elevated interest. *Moderate evidence.*

**Moderate evidence for Decreases:**

4. **Ongoing military conflict could sustain interest** — the CBS News report indicates operations are "ahead of schedule" and will continue for "four weeks or less." If major new developments involving Pahlavi occur near March 11 (e.g., he formally enters Iran, is named transitional leader), interest could spike again. But this is speculative. *Moderate evidence against decrease.*

5. **Pahlavi's media saturation** — multiple Fox News, CBS, WaPo appearances around March 1-2 represent a concentrated burst of coverage. After this burst, coverage will likely normalize. *Moderate evidence for decrease.*

**Weak evidence for Increases:**

6. **Potential for Pahlavi to formally assume power** — if he enters Iran or is formally recognized as transitional leader by March 11, this could cause a new spike exceeding March 2 levels. This is speculative but not impossible given the extraordinary circumstances. *Weak-to-moderate evidence.*

7. **Bot account controversy** — if organic search interest is lower than apparent, the decline might be steeper. *Weak evidence.*

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** March 2 to March 11 — 9 days.

**If halved (4-5 days):** The probability of "Decreases" would be somewhat lower (~70%) because the initial spike from the Khamenei death/60 Minutes might still be partially sustained at day 4-5. The comparison would be March 2 vs. March 6-7, which is closer to the peak.

**If doubled (18 days):** The probability of "Decreases" would be even higher (~90%) because 18 days is more than enough time for the initial shock to fully dissipate, absent sustained major new events.

At 9 days, the decline is very likely but not certain — the ongoing military conflict provides some floor for sustained interest.

---

### (d) Justification

The outside view base rate of 78% for "Decreases" is well-supported by the current evidence. The key factors:

1. **The peak (100) was reached on March 1** — the day before the question window opens. This is the strongest structural factor. Google Trends values at 100 within a fixed window represent the maximum; subsequent days almost always show lower values.

2. **The triggering events (Khamenei death, military strikes) are already past** — they occurred Feb 28-Mar 1. The initial shock drives the peak; the subsequent 9 days will see declining interest as the news cycle evolves.

3. **The ongoing conflict is a wildcard** — if Pahlavi takes on a formal role or major new events occur by March 11, interest could be sustained or even spike again. However, the comparison is March 2 vs. March 11, and March 2 is itself likely to be very high (near the peak), making it harder for March 11 to exceed it by >3 points.

4. **The "Doesn't change" scenario** requires March 11 to be within 3 of March 2. Given the extreme volatility of the situation, a 3-point band is very narrow. Even if interest remains elevated, day-to-day variation in a volatile political situation would likely exceed 3 points.

The main risk to my forecast is if Pahlavi formally enters Iran or assumes a transitional leadership role between March 2 and March 11, which could cause a new spike. Given the military operations are described as ongoing for "four weeks or less," this is possible but unlikely within 9 days.

I'll adjust slightly upward for "Increases" (from 9% to 12%) given the extraordinary circumstances and the possibility of Pahlavi formally assuming power, and slightly downward for "Decreases" (from 78% to 75%).

## Probability Calibration

- **Increases (March 11 > March 2 by >3 points):** Requires a new, larger spike after March 2. Possible if Pahlavi enters Iran or is formally recognized. ~12%
- **Doesn't change (within 3 points):** Requires sustained near-peak interest for 9 days. Possible if conflict escalates continuously with Pahlavi central. ~13%
- **Decreases (March 11 < March 2 by >3 points):** Most likely given peak already reached, triggering events already past, and typical post-spike decline. ~75%

## Checklist

1. **Resolution criteria paraphrase:** Compare Google Trends value for "reza pahlavi" on Mar 11 vs Mar 2 (within Feb 9-Mar 11 window). Decreases if Mar 11 is >3 lower; Increases if >3 higher; Doesn't change if within 3.

2. **Outside view base rate:** Decreases 78%, Doesn't change 13%, Increases 9%. My inside view: Decreases 75%, Doesn't change 13%, Increases 12%. Modest adjustment upward for Increases given extraordinary ongoing events.

3. **Consistency check:** Most likely = Decreases; Least likely = Doesn't change/Increases. Makes sense — peak already reached, post-spike decline expected.

4. **Most significant evidence:**
   - Google Trends at 100 on Mar 1 (peak already reached) ✓ factually confirmed
   - Khamenei death/strikes occurred Feb 28-Mar 1 (triggering events past) ✓ confirmed by multiple sources
   - 60 Minutes appearance Mar 1 (one-time spike driver) ✓ confirmed by CBS/AskNews
   - Ongoing military conflict for ~4 weeks (could sustain interest) ✓ confirmed by CBS News
   - 9-day window long enough for significant decline ✓ consistent with historical patterns

5. **Blind-spot:** Pahlavi formally enters Iran or is declared transitional leader by March 11, causing a massive new spike exceeding March 2 levels. This would shift Increases to ~25-30%.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo is declining interest after a peak — this is the normal pattern for news-driven spikes. The ongoing conflict slightly moderates the decline but doesn't reverse it.

7. **Technicalities:** 12 + 13 + 75 = 100. ✓

Probabilities: [12, 13, 75]
