Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Economic Times (Mar 1, 2026)**: Reports Khamenei reportedly killed following US-Israeli strikes. This is an extraordinary claim. The article is dated March 1, 2026 (yesterday relative to question opening). If accurate, this would be a massive geopolitical event driving enormous search interest in Reza Pahlavi. Quality: Potentially high-impact but extraordinary claim requiring verification.

2. **Jerusalem Post (Jan 20, 2026)**: Academic analysis using Google Trends data showing Pahlavi as dominant opposition figure. Notes a "second, even larger spike" in late December 2025. Quality: Good analytical source, expert opinion.

3. **CBS News (tag/google)**: References Pahlavi being interviewed during "Operation Epic Fury" (US-Israeli military operation against Iran). Mentions American casualties. Quality: Fragmented but suggests ongoing major conflict coverage.

4. **AGSI Analysis**: Academic analysis of Iranian protests Dec 2025-Feb 2026. Notes mass protests beginning Dec 28, 2025. Quality: Good analytical source.

5. **Al Jazeera (Jan 12, 2026)**: Reports protests sweeping Iran with chants supporting Pahlavi. Quality: Reliable news source.

6. **Time Magazine opinion**: Critical analysis of Pahlavi's legitimacy. Quality: Opinion piece, credible publication.

7. **Houston Public Media/NPR (Jan 10, 2026)**: Profile of Pahlavi amid protests. Quality: Reliable.

8. **Iran International (Feb 14, 2026)**: Pahlavi at Munich Security Conference calling to end Islamic Republic. Quality: Reliable.

9. **Reza Pahlavi official website**: Event listings through Feb 9, 2026. Quality: Primary source, promotional.

10. **Washington Examiner (Jun 23, 2025)**: Pahlavi opens defection channel. Quality: Reliable.

11. **BBC (Jan 9, 2026)**: Profile of Pahlavi. Quality: High reliability.

12. **CBS News 60 Minutes (Mar 1, 2026)**: Pahlavi on 60 Minutes - "Iran's Prince Reza Pahlavi believes regime could finally fall." This is a major US television appearance on March 1, 2026 — the day before the question window opens. Quality: High reliability, very relevant.

13. **Agent Report**: Methodological analysis of how to obtain Google Trends data. Confirms episodic surges around key events. Quality: Informative but lacks actual data.

**Key contextual finding**: As of March 1, 2026, Reza Pahlavi scored 100/100 on Google Trends (peak interest in the last 30 days). This is an extraordinarily high value. The question asks whether interest will increase, stay the same, or decrease between March 2 and March 11. Given the peak is already at 100, the only direction possible is down or stable (mathematically, it can't go higher than 100 in the same window).

Wait — I need to re-read the resolution criteria. The question compares the value on March 11 vs. March 2 within a fixed window (Feb 9 - Mar 11). So both values are within the same scaled window, and the comparison is between two specific dates within that window.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

**Reference class 1: Topics at peak interest (value=100)**
When a topic is at its peak (100), subsequent days almost always show lower values as the peak event recedes. The current value of 100 on March 1 suggests a spike event. The question window (Mar 2-11) starts the day after this peak.

**Reference class 2: Political figures during major geopolitical events**
During major events (wars, regime changes), search interest spikes dramatically and then declines as news cycles move on. The 60 Minutes appearance on March 1 and reports of Khamenei's death suggest a massive spike event around March 1.

**Reference class 3: Google Trends day-to-day volatility for political topics**
For highly volatile political topics during major events, >3-point moves are common. The agent report confirms episodic surges with large moves.

The most suitable reference class is **topics at or near peak interest during major geopolitical events** — these almost universally decline as the initial shock fades.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The prediction window is March 2 to March 11 — 9 days. The current context (as of March 1-2, 2026) includes:
- Khamenei reportedly killed (if true, this is the biggest possible event)
- 60 Minutes appearance on March 1
- Ongoing US-Israeli military operations against Iran
- Pahlavi at 100/100 on Google Trends

If the peak occurred around March 1 (60 Minutes + Khamenei death reports), then March 2 would likely still be very high but potentially declining. By March 11, interest would likely have moderated significantly unless new major events occur.

Historical pattern: After major news events, Google Trends values for political figures typically decline 20-50% within a week as news cycles shift.

**(d) Justification**

The critical factors:

1. **Peak already reached**: The value was 100 on March 1. Within the Feb 9-Mar 11 window, March 1 represents the peak. March 2 will likely be somewhat lower (or similar if the event is still breaking), and March 11 will likely be substantially lower as the initial shock fades.

2. **Major triggering events**: Reports of Khamenei's death, US-Israeli military operations, and a 60 Minutes appearance all occurred around March 1. These are massive spike drivers that are unlikely to be sustained at peak levels for 9 days.

3. **Regression to mean**: After extreme spikes, Google Trends values almost always decrease. The question is whether the decrease is >3 points (which seems very likely given the extreme peak).

4. **Possible counter-scenario**: If Pahlavi becomes head of a transitional government or major ongoing events keep him in the news continuously through March 11, interest could remain elevated. But even then, the March 11 value would likely be lower than March 2 as the initial shock dissipates.

5. **The comparison is March 2 vs March 11**: If March 2 is still near peak (say 80-100 in the window), and March 11 is more moderate (say 30-60), the decrease would be well over 3 points.

The overwhelming probability is **Decreases**. The "Doesn't change" scenario requires the value on March 11 to be within 3 of March 2. Given the extreme volatility and the likely post-peak decline, this seems very unlikely. "Increases" would require March 11 to be more than 3 points higher than March 2, which would require an even larger event than what triggered the current peak — possible but unlikely.

**Outside view calibration:**

For topics at peak interest (100/100) during major geopolitical events:
- Probability of decrease (>3 points lower after 9 days): ~80-85%
- Probability of no change (within 3 points): ~10-12%
- Probability of increase (>3 points higher): ~5-8%

The extraordinary nature of the events (Khamenei death reports, military operations) actually makes the peak more extreme and the subsequent decline more likely. However, if these events are ongoing and escalating through March 11, the decline might be smaller. The 60 Minutes appearance on March 1 was a one-time event that would naturally cause a spike-then-decline pattern.

I'll set:
- Decreases: 78%
- Doesn't change: 13%
- Increases: 9%

Outside view calibration:
The base rate for "Decreases" is high because: (1) the topic is at peak (100) and can only go down in relative terms, (2) major spike events typically see rapid decline, (3) the 9-day window is long enough for significant regression. The uncertainty comes from: (1) ongoing military conflict that could sustain interest, (2) potential for Pahlavi to take on formal political roles that would sustain/increase interest, (3) the comparison is between specific days (March 2 and March 11), not the peak day (March 1).

Outside View Prediction:
Option_A (Increases): 9
Option_B (Doesn't change): 13
Option_C (Decreases): 78
