I'll analyze this systematically, following the forecasting framework.

## Analysis

### (a) Source Analysis

**CBS News live-blog (Mar 2, 2026):** High-quality major outlet. Confirms Khamenei killed, US-Israeli strikes ongoing, major escalation. Factual reporting on active military operation. This is the primary news driver for Pahlavi search interest.

**Local10/AP (Mar 1, 2026):** Wire service quality. Confirms 200+ killed, Iranian leadership council formed, power vacuum. Factual, reliable. Directly relevant to why Pahlavi searches spiked.

**Republic World (Mar 2, 2026):** Mid-tier outlet. Reports Pahlavi's Fox News interview calling strikes "game changer." Factual about interview occurring; Pahlavi's characterizations are his opinions.

**WFTV (Feb 27, 2026):** Local affiliate. Reports Kurdish opposition tensions with Pahlavi. Expert opinion from named academic (Mehrzad Boroujerdi, Missouri S&T) that Trump declined to meet Pahlavi - moderate credibility concern for Pahlavi's political viability.

**BSS/AFP (Mar 1, 2026):** AFP wire service = high quality. Confirms Pahlavi urging street protests, calling regime in "final breaths." Factual.

**The Forward (Feb 28, 2026):** Credible specialty outlet. Detailed profile with named pollster (Ammar Maleki) citing ~1/3 Iranian support. Factual background.

**AskNews articles (multiple):** 
- Firstpost (Mar 2): Pahlavi on CBS 60 Minutes claiming "millions calling my name" - high-profile US media appearance confirmed.
- Real Clear Politics (Mar 1): Full Fox News interview transcript - factual, high quality.
- CNEWS/AFP (Mar 1): Washington Post op-ed by Pahlavi - confirms major media placement.
- CBS News video (Mar 1): 60 Minutes scheduled appearance confirmed.
- India TV News (Mar 1): Fox News interview details confirmed.
- Multiple Jan 2026 sources: Background on protest wave, Pahlavi's rising profile.

**Key factual consensus across sources:** On March 1-2, 2026, Reza Pahlavi conducted an extraordinary media blitz (Fox News multiple appearances, CBS 60 Minutes, Washington Post op-ed) coinciding with the reported killing of Khamenei in US-Israeli strikes. This is the event driving the current Google Trends peak of 100.

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence for Decreases:**
- Google Trends post-spike decay is well-documented: after reaching 100 (relative peak), values almost always decline as news novelty fades. The 30-day window shows 100 on Mar 1; by Mar 11, the scale is anchored to the Feb 9-Mar 11 window, so if Mar 1-2 remains the peak, all subsequent days will be lower.
- The measurement window (Feb 9 - Mar 11) is fixed. The peak appears to be Mar 1-2. By Mar 11, unless a new equivalent or larger spike occurs, the value will be substantially lower.
- Historical pattern: major news-driven search spikes (Soleimani killing Jan 2020, etc.) show rapid decay within 3-7 days.
- The question compares Mar 2 vs Mar 11 values. Mar 2 is at or near the peak. Nine days later, decay is highly probable.

**Moderate evidence for Increases (or sustained interest):**
- The geopolitical situation is extraordinarily dynamic - ongoing US-Israeli war with Iran, Khamenei dead, regime in flux. New developments could sustain or re-spike interest.
- Pahlavi has multiple major media appearances scheduled/aired (60 Minutes, Fox News, WaPo op-ed) that could generate sustained coverage.
- If Pahlavi makes a dramatic move (announces return to Iran, gets US endorsement, etc.) between Mar 2-11, interest could spike again.

**Weak evidence for Doesn't Change:**
- The ±3 threshold is narrow. Sustained flat interest over 9 days during a fast-moving news cycle is unlikely.

**Critical technical consideration:** The Google Trends URL uses the fixed date range Feb 9 - Mar 11. Within this window, if Mar 1-2 is the peak (=100), then Mar 11 will almost certainly be lower unless the story sustains at equal intensity. The question asks whether Mar 11 value is within 3 of Mar 2 value. Given that Mar 2 is likely near 100 (the peak), Mar 11 would need to also be ~97-100, which requires sustained peak-level interest for 9 more days. This is extremely rare for news-driven spikes.

However, there's an important nuance: the ongoing war with Iran is not a one-day story. It could sustain elevated interest for weeks. But "sustaining at exactly the same level" vs. "decreasing somewhat" is the key distinction.

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**9 days (Mar 2 → Mar 11).** This is a meaningful window. 

- If halved (~4-5 days): Decrease probability would be lower (~50%), as the story might still be fresh and Pahlavi's media appearances still generating coverage.
- If doubled (~18 days): Decrease probability would be higher (~80%), as even sustained stories fade substantially over 3 weeks.

At 9 days, the story is still relatively fresh but the initial novelty has passed. The ongoing military conflict could sustain some interest, but the specific "Reza Pahlavi" search interest is most driven by his personal media appearances and dramatic statements, which peaked around Mar 1-2.

### (d) Justification

**Base rate:** Decreases 60%, Doesn't change 22%, Increases 18%.

**Adjustments:**

1. **Ongoing war context (+5-8% to Increases, -5-8% to Decreases):** The US-Israeli war on Iran is not a one-day story. Unlike a single press conference or interview, this is an ongoing military conflict that will generate daily news. Pahlavi will likely continue appearing in media throughout this period. However, the *specific* search interest in "Reza Pahlavi" (as opposed to "Iran war") depends on him remaining the focal point of coverage.

2. **Peak timing consideration:** The current value of 100 on Mar 1 in the 30-day window suggests Mar 1-2 is the absolute peak. In the Feb 9-Mar 11 fixed window used for resolution, Mar 2 is likely near 100. For Mar 11 to be within 3 points, it would need to be 97-100, which requires the story to sustain at near-peak intensity. This is unusual even for major ongoing stories.

3. **Multiple major media appearances already aired:** The 60 Minutes interview, Fox News appearances, and WaPo op-ed all occurred on Mar 1-2. These are the catalysts for the peak. Future appearances may occur but are unlikely to generate equal search intensity unless there's a new dramatic development.

4. **Ongoing conflict as sustained driver:** The war is ongoing as of Mar 2. If major developments occur (Pahlavi officially recognized, returns to Iran, US endorses him), interest could spike again. But these are uncertain events.

**Net adjustment:** +7% to Increases, -5% to Decreases, -2% to Doesn't Change.

**Final calibration:**
- Increases: 18% + 7% = 25%
- Doesn't change: 22% - 2% = 20%  
- Decreases: 60% - 5% = 55%

## Checklist

1. **Resolution criteria:** Compare Google Trends value for "reza pahlavi" (US, fixed Feb 9-Mar 11 window) on Mar 11 vs Mar 2. Increases if >3 higher, Decreases if >3 lower, Doesn't change if within ±3.

2. **Base rate:** Decreases 60%, Doesn't change 22%, Increases 18%. My final prediction is rooted in this with modest adjustments for the extraordinary ongoing geopolitical context.

3. **Consistency check:** Most likely = Decreases; Least likely = Doesn't change. Makes sense: post-peak decay is the dominant pattern, and flat interest over 9 days is unlikely.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Mar 1-2 represents the peak of the news cycle (Khamenei death + Pahlavi media blitz) → supports Decreases
   - Ongoing US-Israeli war on Iran sustains some interest → moderates Decreases
   - 60 Minutes + Fox News + WaPo op-ed already aired → front-loaded, supports Decreases
   - Fixed window anchors scale to peak; Mar 11 must match peak to avoid Decreases → supports Decreases
   - New dramatic developments (Pahlavi return, US endorsement) possible but uncertain → modest support for Increases

5. **Blind spot:** If Pahlavi makes a dramatic move between Mar 3-11 (e.g., announces return to Iran, gets formal US government recognition, or appears at a massive rally), interest could spike above Mar 2 levels. This would flip to Increases and make my forecast look wrong. Probability: ~20-25%.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo is that news-driven search interest decays after peaks. Even in ongoing stories, the specific named-person search tends to decay as coverage broadens to the general conflict.

7. **Technicalities:** 25 + 20 + 55 = 100. ✓

## Probability Calibration

Given the extraordinary context (ongoing war, Pahlavi as central figure, multiple media appearances) but the fundamental Google Trends post-peak decay dynamic, I settle on:

- **Increases:** 22% (elevated from base rate due to ongoing conflict)
- **Doesn't change:** 18% (slightly reduced; flat interest over 9 days unlikely)
- **Decreases:** 60% (maintained; post-peak decay is the dominant pattern)

Probabilities: [22, 18, 60]
