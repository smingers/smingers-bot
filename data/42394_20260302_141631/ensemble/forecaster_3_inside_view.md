1) Resolution criteria paraphrase (what counts as each option)
Between 2026-03-02 and 2026-03-11 (UTC) on Google Trends (US, query “reza pahlavi”, fixed range 2026-02-09 to 2026-03-11), compare the daily values: **Increase** if Mar-11 > Mar-02 by >3; **Decrease** if Mar-11 < Mar-02 by >3; otherwise **Doesn’t change** (within ±3).

(a) Source analysis (what each source says + quality/date)

Core news/context sources provided
- **CBS News live updates (Mar 2, 2026)**: Liveblog on day 2 of U.S.-Israel war on Iran; claims Khamenei killed; regional escalation; Trump says operation could take “four weeks or less.” High-reach outlet, but liveblog details can be preliminary/fast-moving.
- **Local10 / wire-style report (Mar 1, 2026)**: Leadership crisis after strikes; three-member council; hints of openness to talks; wider regional conflict. Medium-high reliability (wire-like), though republishing can compress details.
- **Republic World (Mar 2, 2026)**: Highlights Pahlavi calling strikes “game changer,” claiming preparation to lead transition; sourced to Fox interview. Lower/medium reliability; useful mainly as an indicator of media amplification, not as an anchor for factual claims.
- **WFTV (Feb 27, 2026)**: Reports Pahlavi–Kurdish opposition rift; cites named expert Mehrzad Boroujerdi; mentions Trump declined to meet Pahlavi (per reporting). Local outlet but with identifiable expert; medium reliability.
- **BSS/AFP (Mar 1, 2026)**: AFP-style report: Pahlavi urges protests; frames regime as in final phase; notes opposition is divided and criticism of Pahlavi. High reliability due to AFP lineage.
- **The Forward (Feb 28, 2026)**: Profile + contextual reporting; includes poll-like claim (≈1/3 supportive, ≈1/3 opposed) and structural caveat (security forces remain). Niche outlet but generally careful; medium-high reliability.

AskNews article set (signals of media intensity around Mar 1–2)
- **Firstpost (Mar 2)**: Mentions “60 Minutes” interview; Pahlavi claims “millions calling my name”; includes analyst caution. Medium reliability; good for “coverage exists” and timing.
- **En Son Haber (Mar 2, Turkish)**: Pahlavi thanks Trump; calls for new leadership. Medium/low reliability; mainly indicates international pickup.
- **Quotidiano Libero (Mar 2, Italian)**: Notes “manual/plan” for reconstruction; diaspora framing. Tabloid-ish; low/medium reliability; again mostly “coverage volume” signal.
- **ANI (Mar 2)**: Repackages Fox interview lines (“beginning of very end”). Medium reliability; syndicated, sometimes sensational; still a “coverage exists” marker.
- **RealClearPolitics (Mar 1)**: Posts Fox interview transcript/video; strong evidence of a major U.S. media appearance (primary-source hosting). High reliability for “he said X on Fox.”
- **CNEWS (Mar 1, French)**: Pahlavi urges celebrations; references WaPo op-ed; medium reliability.
- **CBS News video listing (Mar 1)**: “Sunday on 60 Minutes” segment scheduled; high reliability for “major broadcast occurred.”
- **India TV News (Mar 1)**: Repackages Fox content + adds claims about interim leader. Medium/low; use as “coverage exists,” not fine facts.
- **O Globo/AFP (Mar 1)**: Diaspora reaction and quotes; high reliability due to AFP syndication.
- **UDN (Feb 28, Chinese)**: Reports operation name + Pahlavi call; medium reliability; “coverage exists.”
- **AFP (Feb 15, French)**: Pahlavi urging intervention; diaspora rallies; high reliability.
- **Mint (Feb 15)**: Repackages rally + CBS references; medium reliability.
- **ANI (Jan 19)**: “I will return to Iran” message; medium reliability.
- **Euronews Arabic (Jan 13)**: Claims secret meeting; mentions Trump admin stance; medium reliability (harder to verify).
- **Liberty Times / Die Welt / CBS (Jan 12–13)**: Coverage of earlier protest wave and Pahlavi positioning; CBS especially high reliability; others medium.

Bottom line on source set: irrespective of some low/medium outlets, there is **broad, multi-outlet confirmation of unusually intense coverage of Reza Pahlavi on Mar 1–2** (Fox + CBS/60 Minutes + AFP writeups), in the middle of an extraordinary Iran shock event. That matters because the question is about Google search interest.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted factors vs the resolution rule)

Strong evidence (pushes meaningfully)
1. **Regression from a spike / “already at peak” mechanics** (strong, structural): We have explicit context that “reza pahlavi” hit **100** in the prior 30 days as of Mar 1. In fixed windows, huge geopolitical spikes typically mean the first 1–3 days are near-max, then decay over a week. That strongly favors **Decreases** by Mar 11 vs Mar 2.
2. **Event-driven news cycle pattern** (strong historical regularity): leadership-assassination/war-start attention is front-loaded. Unless a second marquee Pahlavi-centric event occurs, interest usually drops materially within 9 days.

Moderate evidence (nudges)
3. **War duration likely extends through Mar 11** (moderate): Trump’s “four weeks or less” and escalating strikes imply the broader Iran story stays prominent, which can keep Pahlavi searches elevated longer than a typical single-day spike. This slightly **reduces** the Decreases probability (more chance of “Doesn’t change” or even “Increase” if Pahlavi becomes central).
4. **Heavy U.S. media appearances concentrated Mar 1–2** (moderate): Fox + 60 Minutes + op-ed timing implies **Mar 2 is likely still near a local maximum** for “Reza Pahlavi” searches, raising the chance that Mar 11 is lower.

Weak evidence (small adjustments)
5. **Opposition rifts (Kurdish criticism)**: could marginally shift attention, but unclear direction for searches (controversy can increase searches). Net weak.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window: **9 days** (from 2026-03-02 to 2026-03-11).
- If the window were **halved** (~4–5 days): more chance the interest stays near peak/plateau; **Doesn’t change** would rise.
- If the window were **doubled** (~18 days): much more reversion-to-mean; **Decreases** would become even more dominant.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside view base rates (given): **Increases 9 / Doesn’t change 13 / Decreases 78**.

Key inside-view question: will anything happen between Mar 2 and Mar 11 that makes Mar 11 *as high as or higher than* Mar 2?

- Status quo if nothing new happens: the war continues, but the initial “who replaces Khamenei / what about Pahlavi” surge fades as coverage pivots to battlefield updates, oil/shipping, casualties, diplomacy. That suggests **Mar 11 < Mar 2** by well more than 3 points.
- What would make **Increase** happen? A distinctly Pahlavi-centered milestone (e.g., internationally recognized as transitional leader, dramatic announcement/return attempt, viral speech, major U.S. endorsement explicitly naming him, or a sudden collapse creating “Pahlavi as successor” headlines). Possible, but comparatively low probability.
- What would make **Doesn’t change** happen? A sustained plateau where daily search interest remains essentially flat within a tight ±3 band. Given Trends day-to-day volatility during crises, that band is narrow; so “Doesn’t change” is plausibly **lower** than my outside-view 13%.

Net adjustment: I slightly **increase** Decreases and slightly **reduce** Doesn’t change, because (i) Mar 2 is likely near the spike apex due to concentrated media hits, and (ii) the ±3 threshold is tight.

Probability calibration:
- I’m treating “Decreases” as the status-quo outcome with high likelihood.
- I’m keeping “Increases” non-trivial because geopolitics can generate a second spike, but it still requires a particularly Pahlavi-salient development.
- I’m discounting “Doesn’t change” because the ±3 rule is strict amid volatile news.

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options check: Compare Mar-11 vs Mar-02 values in fixed Feb-09–Mar-11 window; ±3 => Doesn’t change; >3 up => Increases; >3 down => Decreases. (Aligned.)
2) Outside view base rate used: [9, 13, 78].
3) Consistency check: Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Doesn’t change (tight band) (makes sense).
4) Top evidence (<=20 words each):
   - Mar 1 shows 100 interest; Mar 2 likely near peak; spikes decay within ~1 week.
   - Massive “shock” news (war, Khamenei death) is front-loaded; attention shifts to operations/diplomacy.
   - War may sustain baseline interest but rarely keeps “who is Pahlavi” searches at peak for 9 days.
5) Blind spot: Pahlavi becomes formally designated/recognized transitional leader (or dramatic return attempt) near Mar 11, causing a second peak.
6) Status quo: continuing war without a Pahlavi-specific milestone => gradual decline (supports Decreases).
7) Technicalities: Probabilities sum to 100; no % signs.

Probabilities: [10, 6, 84]
