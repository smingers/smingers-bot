**Analyzing Google Trends for Reza Pahlavi**

I need to look at the interest change for “Reza Pahlavi” between March 2 and March 11, 2026, within a fixed window from February 9 to March 11 in the US. I’ll compare interest values between these two dates, looking for changes over a threshold of three points. With ongoing significant events like a major war, Pahlavi's interest could remain elevated, especially if related news or events occur.**Evaluating Interest Fluctuations**

I think the interest for Reza Pahlavi likely peaked around March 2, shortly after Khamenei's death on February 28. While searches may stabilize or decline between March 2 and March 11, there’s a chance of a second spike if he takes action. If interest levels plateau between 70-90, minor changes could fall within a three-point threshold. Ongoing war coverage may maintain interest, especially with media attention and interviews in early March. There’s a lot to consider as this situation develops!**Assessing Interest Dynamics**

The probability of interest decreasing seems possible, but an increase is still unlikely unless March 2 isn't the peak and interest surpasses it later. If March 11 hits 100 due to a significant event, earlier values might be scaled down. This scenario suggests that if Pahlavi emerges as a transitional leader or returns, it could generate renewed interest. Given the high interest recorded on March 1, March 2 likely hovers around 98-100, while March 11 could see a significant decrease if no new peak occurs.**Analyzing Value Trends**

Given that the scaling is fixed from February 9 to March 11, both March 2 and March 11 values might be lower compared to the overall peak, such as March 1 being 100. If March 2 sits around 90 and March 11 around 60, that indicates a decrease. If they’re close to each other, like March 2 at 60 and March 11 at 62, it signals stability. Typically, after a spike, interest drops slightly but then continues to decay over the week. I estimate a decrease between 70 and 78, given the ongoing war could influence these numbers.**Evaluating Interest Shifts**

The ongoing war and discussions around Pahlavi may influence his media presence. If attention shifts to oil and casualties, interest in him could decrease. The appointment of a new supreme leader could also reduce focus on Pahlavi, but it might create a power vacuum. By March 11, if significant events occur like a regime collapse, interest dynamics could really change. I estimate a decrease probability around 84, with increases at 9 and doesn't change at 7. This feels coherent based on recent events and media coverage.
