**Evaluating trends and attention analysis**

I need to conduct a source analysis for each summary. Many sources discuss current geopolitical events rather than specific trend movements. The agent report suggests there's a computation issue, so let’s focus on Google Trends data. I’m considering daily values for political figures after major news and looking for specific trends around Reza Pahlavi but found no data. My timeframe is from March 2 to March 11, and I suspect attention will decay over time, with a possibility of staying elevated during ongoing crises.**Structuring an analysis**

I'm setting the distribution values: 60% for decreases, 25% for no change, and 15% for increases. This should sum to 100%, which feels right. Now, I want to craft a structured analysis around these values to examine trends effectively. It’s all about ensuring clarity in how I present the findings and making sure I'm providing useful insights based on these distributions. I’ll keep refining until it really conveys the information well.
