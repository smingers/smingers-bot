**Exploring relative values**

I'm considering how we measure values over the specified window from February 9 to March 11. While I can't pinpoint an absolute peak, I know that the highest day, which could vary, plays a pivotal role. If higher scores emerge after March 2, that could shift the relative scores within the window. For example, if a spike happens on March 5, the March 2 value might look lower in comparison. So, final scaling depends on the entire window, concluding after March 11.**Forecasting interest trends**

I’m evaluating search interest trends from February 9 to March 11. The highest day will represent a peak of 100, and I'm trying to predict whether interest on March 11 will surpass March 2 by at least 3 points. If both days are below the peak—like March 5 hitting 100—the difference could be minimal. I assume March 1 is near a local max, and interest might gradually decline afterward. A new noteworthy event could spark a search surge on March 11. The situation is uncertain, considering war dynamics and regime changes.**Analyzing search interest scenarios**

I'm exploring search interest around Pahlavi and key events up to March 11. If the Supreme Leader is chosen by March 4 and it’s not Pahlavi, interest may still exist but could be overshadowed. Historical trends show search volumes rapidly decline after broadcasts, so I’ll adjust my predictions. I think about different scenarios: one where regime collapse leads to increased interest, another where interest plateaus, and lastly, where there’s a quick decay. I need to summarize my sources and consolidate key evidence effectively for this analysis.
