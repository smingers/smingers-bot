**Assessing interest predictions**

I'm focusing on predicting whether interest in "Reza Pahlavi" will increase, decrease, or remain unchanged from March 2 to March 11, 2026. I'll analyze various sources, particularly articles related to protests and his recent news presence, evaluating their quality and relevance. I'll use Google Trends data as a reference for daily interest changes over nine days. It seems that movements greater than 3 points often occur, and I estimate about a 50% probability for interest changes across that period. I'll define an interest index for this analysis.**Analyzing interest trends**

I'm analyzing the interest value for "Reza Pahlavi" on March 1, 2026, which peaks at 100 due to significant news. If I switch the analysis window to February 9 to March 11, the scale might still peak at 100 around March 1. I expect that interest will decline in the following nine days as news fades unless new developments arise. 

For that period, I estimate a 60% probability of a decrease in interest, 25% for stability, and 15% for an increase. I’ll summarize sources, analyze relevant factors, and craft the necessary documentation.
