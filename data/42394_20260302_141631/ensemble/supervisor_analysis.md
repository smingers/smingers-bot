Disagreement Analysis:

1. **Probability of "Increases" (10-25% range)**: Forecasters 3 and 1 assign low probability (10-12%) to an increase, while forecforecasters 4 and 5 assign much higher probability (22-25%). The core disagreement is whether the ongoing Iran war and Pahlavi's continued media presence can generate a *second spike* between March 3-11 that exceeds the March 2 value. Forecasters 4 and 5 specifically cite scheduled media appearances (60 Minutes repeat on March 8, Fox town-hall on March 9, Global Freedom Rally on March 10) as concrete drivers of renewed interest, while forecasters 1 and 3 treat these as speculative. This disagreement shifts the weighted average by ~8-10 percentage points between Increases and Decreases.

2. **Probability of "Doesn't change" (6-28% range)**: Forecaster 3 assigns only 6% while forecaster 4 assigns 28%. The disagreement centers on whether the ±3 threshold is so tight that sustained flat interest is nearly impossible (forecaster 3's view) versus whether an ongoing war creates a plateau effect where day-to-day values hover near each other (forecaster 4's view). This is a ~22 percentage point spread on a single option.

3. **Whether specific Pahlavi media events are scheduled for March 8-10**: Forecaster 5 cites a "60 Minutes repeat broadcast next Sunday (8 Mar)", a "Fox town-hall (9 Mar)", and a "Global Freedom Rally" on March 10 as concrete upcoming events. No other forecaster mentions these specific scheduled events, and it's unclear whether these are confirmed or speculated. If real, they significantly raise the probability of sustained or increased interest; if fabricated/hallucinated, the decay thesis is much stronger.

Root Causes:

1. **Increases probability**: Partly different factual beliefs (are there confirmed upcoming media appearances/events for Pahlavi in the March 8-11 window?) and partly different weighting of the same evidence (how much does an ongoing war sustain personal-name search interest vs. generic "Iran war" searches).

2. **Doesn't change probability**: Primarily different weighting — how tight is ±3 in practice during volatile news periods, and whether war-driven plateaus are common in Google Trends data for personal names.

3. **Scheduled events claim**: This is a verifiable factual disagreement. Either these events (60 Minutes repeat Mar 8, Fox town-hall Mar 9, Global Freedom Rally Mar 10) are confirmed or they are not.
