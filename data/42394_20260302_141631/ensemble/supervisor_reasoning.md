Resolution of Disagreements:

**1. Scheduled media events for March 8-10 (RESOLVED - clearly against forecasters 4 and 5):**
The targeted research definitively resolved the key factual disagreement. The agent report confirms that **none** of the three specific events cited by forecaster 5 (60 Minutes repeat on March 8, Fox town hall on March 9, Global Freedom Rally on March 10) are confirmed. These appear to have been hallucinated or speculated. The only confirmed Pahlavi media appearances (60 Minutes and Fox News) both aired on March 1, 2026. This is significant because forecasters 4 and 5 used these supposed upcoming events as a major justification for assigning higher probabilities to "Increases" (22-25%) and "Doesn't change" (20-28%). Without these concrete drivers, the case for sustained or increased interest weakens substantially.

**2. Whether the ongoing war can sustain personal-name search interest (PARTIALLY RESOLVED):**
The research confirms the war is ongoing and Pahlavi remains a prominent figure in diaspora celebrations (European Conservative article documents rallies on March 2). However, the CBS News live updates article about the war doesn't even mention Pahlavi by name, suggesting that as the conflict continues, coverage shifts toward military operations, diplomacy, and regime succession rather than Pahlavi specifically. This moderately supports the "Decreases" camp.

**3. Tightness of the ±3 threshold (NOT RESOLVED):**
This remains a judgment call. However, given that March 2 is likely near the peak (100 on March 1), and no confirmed follow-up events exist, the probability of staying within ±3 for 9 days seems low.

Updated Analysis:

The resolution of the scheduled-events disagreement is the most consequential finding. Forecasters 4 and 5 assigned significantly higher probabilities to "Increases" and "Doesn't change" partly based on supposed concrete upcoming events that don't exist. This shifts the balance toward forecasters 1 and 3, who assigned higher probabilities to "Decreases."

Key factors in my updated assessment:
- **March 1-2 represents the peak** driven by Khamenei's death + concentrated media blitz (60 Minutes, Fox News, WaPo op-ed)
- **No confirmed follow-up media events** for Pahlavi in the March 3-11 window
- **Ongoing war provides some floor** but coverage naturally shifts from "who is Pahlavi" to battlefield/diplomatic updates
- **The ±3 threshold is tight** making "Doesn't change" relatively unlikely over 9 days
- **Unpredictable events** (Pahlavi return to Iran, formal recognition, new crisis) could still cause a spike, but these are speculative

I should shift the weighted average toward higher "Decreases" probability and lower "Increases" and "Doesn't change," reflecting the debunking of the scheduled events that were driving the higher-end estimates.

The weighted average of [18.2, 17.0, 64.8] should be adjusted:
- "Increases" should decrease from 18.2% since the main drivers (scheduled events) are debunked. However, the ongoing war and potential for unpredictable developments keep this non-trivial. ~14%
- "Doesn't change" should decrease slightly from 17.0% given no sustained drivers. ~12%
- "Decreases" should increase from 64.8% to reflect the stronger case for post-peak decay. ~74%

Confidence: HIGH

Probabilities: [14, 12, 74]
