Gaps a forecaster still needs to fill:  
1. Base-rate / volatility: How often do daily changes for this term exceed 3 points? Knowing the historical distribution of single-day swings in the last 1–2 years gives probabilistic grounding for “Doesn’t change” vs the two directional options.  
2. Resolution mechanics & current benchmark: Exact daily value for 03-02 once the new day is recorded, and the locked scaling URL.  
3. Key drivers: What typically creates spikes or drops in interest for Reza Pahlavi (e.g., protests in Iran, regime news, interviews, US press appearances)?  
4. Current state / upcoming catalysts between now and 03-11: Any scheduled speeches, anniversaries (1979 revolution events, Nowruz prep), media appearances, or breaking Iran news that could move search interest.  
5. Contrarian check: Evidence of an imminent lull or of saturation after a recent peak which might make a >3-point fall more likely.
