Reza Pahlavi says 'millions of Iranians are calling my name'**\nFollowing the reported death of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in US-Israeli strikes on March 2, 2026, Reza Pahlavi, the 65-year-old son of Iran's last Shah, has positioned himself as a potential transitional leader for Iran. In an interview with CBS News' '60 Minutes', Pahlavi claimed that 'millions of Iranians inside and outside Iran are calling my name' and view him as a figure to steer the country toward democracy, stating, 'I'm totally focused on my mission in life, which is: let me bring the country to a point where they can make that free choice.' Pahlavi outlined four fundamental values for his proposed rule: respect for territorial integrity, separation of religion from the state, equality under the law with individual liberties, and electoral democracy, which he termed the 'most important' pillar. He described secularism as a 'prerequisite to democracy' and noted that Iranians have suffered under a 'religious dictatorship.' However, analysts caution that Pahlavi does not command a meaningful movement inside Iran, having lived outside the country for nearly five decades. While he has the backing of US President Donald Trump and influential figures in the MAGA movement, Pahlavi remains cautious about explicitly endorsing them, stating he does not expect an official endorsement from a foreign government. The article notes that while Iranians are disgruntled with Khamenei's regime, this does not necessarily translate into support for Pahlavi, who currently relies on support from the diaspora and Western security hawks rather than a mass movement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 10:25 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/world/who-after-khamenei-in-iran-reza-pahlavi-says-millions-of-iranians-are-calling-my-name-13985437.html)\n\n**Reza Pahlavi Calls for New Iranian Leadership and Thanks Trump Amidst Ongoing Attacks**\nOn March 2, 2026, Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah of Iran, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, appeared on a TV program during ongoing attacks on Iran to express gratitude to US President Donald Trump. According to the report from En Son Haber, Reza Pahlavi had previously used social media to call on Iranian citizens to take to the streets following the escalation. The situation escalated after Israel, with US support, bombed Iran, prompting a retaliatory missile strike from Iran that caused chaos involving many countries. Reza Pahlavi stated that Iran needs 'a strong and stable leadership that will seize this opportunity,' framing the current events as a pivotal moment for the country's future governance.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 08:02 AM\nSource:[En Son Haber](https://www.ensonhaber.com/dunya/riza-pehlevi-irana-yeni-lider-cagrisi-yapip-trumpa-tesekkur-etti)\n\n**Iranian Heir Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Releases Regime Change Plan Following US-Israel Strike**\nFollowing a military intervention decided by the United States and Israel on the morning of March 2, 2026, the Iranian diaspora, numbering over 4 million people who have fled since 1979, harbors hopes for a post-cleric revival. The largest community resides in the United States (over 1.5 million), followed by communities in Canada and Germany. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the heir to the throne and son of the last Shah, has circulated a 10-point manual for the economic and social reconstruction of Iran's 90 million population, 60-70% of whom are under 30 years old. The 'Project for the Return of Iran to Prosperity' proposes diverting substantial oil revenue away from nuclear arsenals and infinite arms supplies to allies opposing the 'Zionist enemy'. In a social media post on the evening of March 2, 2026, Pahlavi claimed that 'the Islamic Republic has effectively reached its end and will soon be relegated to the dustbin of history.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 03:34 AM\nSource:[Quotidiano Libero](https://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/esteri/46594616/iran_cambio_regime_teheran_gira_manuale/)\n\n**\"Beginning of very end of the regime\": Exiled crown prince Pahlavi on US-Israel strikes on Iran**\nAccording to Exiled Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, US-Israel joint military strikes on Iran that resulted in the death of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his family on Sunday, March 2, 2026, mark 'the beginning of the very end of the regime.' In an interview with Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures,' Pahlavi described the event as a 'game changer' that has sparked jubilation among Iranians both domestically and in the diaspora. He asserted that the strikes, which he characterized as a 'full decapitation of the regime,' will significantly weaken the ruling establishment and accelerate its collapse, contrasting this with previous interventions aimed solely at curbing Iran's nuclear program. Pahlavi stated he is preparing for a political transition, envisioning a shift from the current theocratic system to a democratic framework, and is willing to lead a transitional process supported by a 'diverse coalition' including activists and military members. Following the strikes, the Islamic Republic launched retaliatory strikes using drones and missiles targeting multiple Arab countries in the region, according to Asian News International (ANI).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 02, 2026 03:06 AM\nSource:[Asian News International (ANI)](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/us/beginning-of-very-end-of-the-regime-exiled-crown-prince-pahlavi-on-us-israel-strikes-on-iran20260302083531/)\n\n**Exiled Shah Reza Pahlavi: \"I Am Leading This Transition,\" \"The Military Will Side With Us, And We Have A Plan\"**\nIn an interview with Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo on March 1, 2026, exiled former Crown Prince of Iran Reza Pahlavi described the death of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and recent U.S.-Israeli strikes against Iran as a 'game-changer' that marks the 'beginning of the very end of the regime.' Pahlavi stated he is 'leading this transition' with the 'support of millions of Iranian people' and claimed that 'the military will side with us, and we have a plan of action and a transition plan.' He expressed gratitude to President Trump for 'delivering on his promise' and noted that the jubilation of Iranians 'at home and abroad' reflects their hope for this moment. Pahlavi outlined a vision for a 'secular government' that includes 'Persians, Shia, Sunni' and religious minorities, aiming for a 'democratic outcome' where 'the Iranian people get to choose their future government and system.' He projected the transitional leadership period to last 'not be longer than a couple of years at most,' with the 'first 100 days' being critical to stabilize the country. Regarding economic impact, Pahlavi claimed an 'open' Iranian market could generate 'probably over one trillion dollars' worth of impact and revenue to the American economy' through investment. He referenced discussions with Senator Lindsey Graham, whom he calls 'Uncle Lindsey,' regarding a 'bipartisan group at the Senate level' to review the 'Iran Prosperity Project' (IPP). Pahlavi contrasted his 'ironclad plan' with the 'post-Saddam Hussein de-Ba'athification' scenario in Iraq and the situation in Venezuela, asserting that 'whatever remains behind that is not part of the solution is not incorporated into our transition,' while the 'civilian bureaucracy, as well as the military and security forces, will be incorporated appropriately.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 09:52 PM\nSource:[Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2026/03/01/reza_pahlavi_i_am_leading_this_transition_the_military_will_side_with_us_and_we_have_a_plan.html)\n\n**Reza Pahlavi Calls for Iranian Celebrations Following Death of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in US-Israel Strikes**\nOn March 1, 2026, following reports of Israeli and American strikes that killed Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's former Shah, called on the Iranian population to celebrate Khamenei's death. In a statement released on X (Twitter) and in a Washington Post op-ed, Pahlavi described Khamenei as a 'demon' responsible for the 'massacre of thousands of sons and daughters of Iran' and declared that the Islamic Republic was reaching its 'last breath.' Pahlavi urged Iranians to hold nightly 'chants' while remaining 'safe' to express satisfaction with the regime's destruction and to voice demands for Iran's future, while also asking the Iranian diaspora to 'intensify' their efforts. He positioned himself as a 'transition figure' who thanked Donald Trump for the attack and outlined a path involving a new constitution drafted and ratified by referendum, followed by free elections under international supervision, after which the transitional government would be dissolved. Pahlavi noted that many Iranians had called on him to lead this transition 'at the peril of their lives,' though critics have previously feared he might restore the monarchy.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 09:36 PM\nSource:[CNEWS](https://www.cnews.fr/monde/2026-03-01/iran-le-fils-du-chah-reza-pahlavi-appelle-les-iraniens-celebrer-la-mort-dali)\n\n**Iran | Sunday on 60 Minutes**\nReza Pahlavi, identified as a leader of the Iranian opposition to the Islamic Republic and the son of the deposed late Shah of Iran, is scheduled to appear on '60 Minutes' with host Scott Pelley on March 1, 2026, at 21:36.

Pahlavi stated he has a 'plan of action' and a 'transition plan,' asserting that Khamenei's regime must be removed for the benefit of both the US and the Islamic Republic. He claimed to have the support of 'millions in Iran' and alleged that 'even the Iranian military will side with him.' Pahlavi projected that his potential leadership could generate 'over a trillion dollars worth of impact and revenue to the American economy' by opening Iran's market to the US and attracting 'billions of dollars willing to be invested into Iran.' According to the article, Pahlavi is the eldest son of the last monarch, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, born in 1960 in Tehran, and designated crown prince in 1967. Following his father's death in 1980, Pahlavi proclaimed himself Shah while in exile. The article also notes that 67-year-old senior Shia cleric Ayatollah Alireza Arafi was appointed as the interim supreme leader. Additionally, Iran has targeted US bases and Israel, with one attack killing 10 people, prompting warnings from the US and Israel against further escalation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 05:43 PM\nSource:[India TV News](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/have-a-plan-of-action-exiled-iranian-crown-prince-reza-pahlavi-makes-push-for-return-2026-03-01-1032218)\n\n**Iranian Diaspora Hopes for Regime Change Following US-Israel Attacks and Supreme Leader's Death**\nAccording to a report by AFP published in O Globo on March 01, 2026, members of the Iranian diaspora in Turkey, Europe, and elsewhere are expressing hope for a regime change following US and Israeli attacks and the death of Iran's Supreme Leader. Ali, a 40-year-old Iranian film director living in Istanbul, stated that 'everyone is waiting and is content,' celebrating the 'humanitarian operation' conducted by the US and Israel. Officially, more than 72,000 Iranians reside in Turkey with residence permits, and another 5,000 are there as refugees. Sepideh, a former teacher and refugee in Turkey, expressed happiness and concern, noting that internet access was cut in Iran. Reza Pahlavi, son of the deposed Shah, announced on the X platform that 'with his death, the Islamic Republic has in fact reached its end and will soon be thrown in the trash can of history.' Amir Hossein, a singer from Tehran living in Turkey, declared that Iranians are ready to return immediately upon Pahlavi's order to 'build a grand Iran.' However, Mehdi, an Azerbaijani engineer from Tabriz, stated he supports neither Israel, US President Donald Trump, nor the return of Reza Pahlavi, predicting 'difficult days' but asserting survival. Many in the diaspora view the conflict as an opportunity to avenge the deaths and detentions of tens of thousands of protesters, particularly young people, during the January protests which were harshly repressed. Nina, a woman from Tabriz living in Turkey, warned that if the regime is not toppled now, 'there will be even more massacres.' In London, approximately 300 people gathered to express solidarity, with some marching toward the Iranian embassy, while dozens of pacifist demonstrators shouted 'Do not intervene in Iran' and 'Stop killing children.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 01, 2026 03:00 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2026/03/01/iranianos-em-diaspora-alimentam-esperanca-de-novo-regime-apos-ataques-dos-eua-e-israel-e-morte-de-lider-supremo.ghtml)\n\n**Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi Calls for Uprising Following US-Israel Strike**\nOn February 28, 2026, following a joint US-Israel military operation against Iran codenamed 'Epic Wrath' (\u53f2\u8a69\u6012\u706b), former Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi (referred to as Reza) characterized the action as a 'humanitarian intervention' and declared that the 'decisive moment' has arrived, though he stated the final 'battle' must be completed by the Iranian people themselves. Reza, who has lived in exile in the US for years, called on anti-government protesters to return to the streets and stated he is 'ready to lead Iran's transition.' In response to the US strike, Reza posted in both Persian and English on social media platform X, urging the Iranian public to 'wait at home and stay calm' while preparing for a 'final action.' He also addressed Iranian law enforcement and security forces, telling them to consider their duty as protecting the people rather than shielding a regime that uses suppression and crime to hold the country hostage. While US President Trump stated in a January interview with Reuters that Reza 'seems like a nice guy,' he expressed uncertainty regarding whether Reza can garner sufficient support within Iran to ultimately seize power. US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed to Fox News last month that he met with Reza on Trump's orders, though he provided no further details. The joint military action occurred on February 28, 2026, and Reza's statements were published on the same day via UDN.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 28, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/124061/9350498)\n\n**Reza Pahlavi Urges Trump for Urgent Military Intervention in Iran**\nReza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah of Iran, urged Donald Trump to take 'urgent' military intervention in Iran during an appearance on Fox News on Sunday, February 15, 2026. He reiterated his proposal for a political 'transition' in Iran, framing it as a humanitarian effort to save lives lost under the current regime. Pahlavi emphasized that Iranians, both inside Iran and in the diaspora, are demanding external assistance. He called for unifying the secular and democratic opposition\u2014whether in favor of a constitutional monarchy or a republic\u2014so that the Iranian people can democratically decide their country\u2019s future through a transparent, internationally monitored process. His call for intervention has not been universally supported within the fragmented Iranian opposition. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands protested in cities including Munich, Toronto, Melbourne, and Los Angeles in favor of international action against Tehran. The U.S. and Iran are also engaged in nuclear talks in Geneva under Omani mediation, following resumed negotiations on February 6, 2026. However, Pahlavi dismissed the talks as a tactic for the regime to delay meaningful change, stating that 'the regime gains time through negotiations, which will never lead to anything.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 05:38 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/97MV3ZR)\n\n**US-Iran tensions: Reza Pahlavi calls on Trump to 'help', rally in Munich draws over 200,000 exiled Iranians | Today News**\nReza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, addressed over 200,000 supporters at a rally in Munich on February 15, 2026, calling for a secular democratic transition in Iran. He stated that he is committed to leading Iran\u2019s transition to democracy and affirmed that the current regime will fall regardless of foreign intervention, though external support could reduce casualties and accelerate change. According to CBS News, Pahlavi emphasized that a 'vast majority of the Iranian people' support his leadership. He urged Iranians inside Iran and in the diaspora to continue protests, including coordinated chants at 8:00 pm on Saturday and Sunday, aligning with global demonstrations. The rally featured chants of 'Javid shah' and displays of green, white, and red flags with the lion-and-sun emblem of the former monarchy. Demonstrations also occurred in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Toronto, with participants urging U.S. President Donald Trump to act. Trump, who previously stated that a change in Iranian leadership would be 'the best thing that could happen,' had ordered a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East and warned of military action, initially in response to protests in January 2026 that were met with a violent crackdown. Human Rights Activists News Agency reported at least 7,010 deaths\u2014mostly protesters\u2014and over 53,845 arrests during the crackdown, though rights groups believe the actual numbers are higher.

He described the current struggle in Iran as a battle between 'occupation and liberation' and claimed the Iranian people have called for him to lead. Pahlavi outlined a comprehensive vision for a 'free Iran' that would end its nuclear military program, cease support for terrorist groups, normalize relations with the United States, recognize Israel, and become a stabilizing force in the Middle East. He emphasized that a democratic Iran would act as a responsible global partner, promote transparency, combat corruption, open its economy to trade and investment, and leverage its vast oil and gas reserves to become a reliable energy supplier. He also highlighted Iran's educated population and global diaspora as assets for future prosperity. His message was supported by U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who met with Pahlavi and affirmed Washington\u2019s backing for the Iranian people, stating, 'It will be up to the people of Iran to pick their next leader.' The announcement comes amid widespread unrest in Iran, with protests reported at over 280 locations, initially sparked by record inflation and currency devaluation but escalating into broader anti-regime demonstrations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 02:56 AM\nSource:[Asian News International (ANI)](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/europe/i-will-return-to-iran-irans-exiled-crown-prince-reza-pahlavi20260119082423/)\n\n**Secret Meeting Between Witkoff and Pahlavi, Israel Reports 5,000 Protester Deaths in Iran**\nOn January 13, 2026, a confidential meeting took place between Steve Witkoff, a senior White House envoy, and Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran\u2019s deposed Shah, to discuss the escalating protests in Iran. According to Axios, citing a senior U.S. official, this marked the first high-level contact between the Iranian opposition and the Trump administration since the protests began 15 days prior. The White House National Security Council held a morning meeting on Tuesday to assess options, without President Donald Trump\u2019s participation, though no decision on military action has been made, with officials noting the difficulty of predicting Trump\u2019s next move. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed closed-door meetings that the administration is currently evaluating responses to support protesters, while ruling out a large-scale, public military strike on Iran. Meanwhile, Israel shared an intelligence assessment with Washington indicating that at least 5,000 protesters have been killed in a widespread crackdown by Iranian authorities. Trump publicly urged the Iranian people to 'continue protesting' and 'take control of government institutions,' stating that 'help is on the way,' though he provided no details, only adding that Americans should leave Iran immediately. Reza Pahlavi, who has lived in exile in the U.S. for nearly 50 years, has emerged as a prominent symbolic figure in the protests, with his name chanted in multiple Iranian cities. He has publicly declared his readiness to return to Iran to lead a transitional government toward democracy, stating his goal is to enable Iranians to freely choose their leaders. His calls for protest have been amplified by Persian-language media abroad. The Trump administration initially did not view Pahlavi as a significant political actor, and Trump avoided publicly endorsing him in a recent radio interview. The protests have intensified this week, driven by Pahlavi\u2019s latest appeal for demonstrations, which has been widely broadcast by foreign media.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 08:47 PM\nSource:[euronews](http://arabic.euronews.com/2026/01/13/a-secret-meeting-between-witkopf-and-pahlavi-and-israel-informs-washington-of-the-kil)\n\n**Exiled Iranian Prince Urges Trump to 'Act Quickly' to Topple Iran Regime and End Crisis**\nIranian exiled royal heir Reza Pahlavi, speaking in a CBS News interview, urged U.S. President Trump to take immediate interventionist action against the Iranian regime, arguing that early intervention is essential to prevent further bloodshed and end the ongoing crisis. Pahlavi stated that the Iranian government's recent outreach to the U.S. is a strategic attempt to suppress nationwide protests. He emphasized that Trump's previously stated 'red lines' have already been crossed and that the regime is misleading the international community by pretending to seek negotiations. According to Pahlavi, the key to changing the situation lies in making the regime understand it cannot continue suppressing protesters without facing international consequences. When asked if encouraging Iranians to protest amounts to urging them to die, Pahlavi responded that this is a war, and war entails casualties; thus, action is necessary to minimize innocent civilian deaths. He praised Trump as a leader who 'follows through on his words,' distinguishing him from some previous U.S. presidents. The interview was published on January 13, 2026, by the Liberty Times Net.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 02:53 AM\nSource:[Liberty Times Net](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/5308040)\n\n**Reza Pahlavi Urges U.S. to Intervene in Iran Amid Mass Protests**\nReza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Iranian Shah and living in exile in the United States, is urging the U.S. to intervene in Iran amid ongoing mass protests.

Pahlavi claimed to have communicated with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, though he provided no details. Trump previously affirmed that the U.S. takes the situation seriously, stating that the military is assessing 'very drastic options' and that he receives hourly updates on developments in Iran.

According to Chosun.com and other major outlets, chants such as 'Long live the Shah' and 'The Pahlavis are coming back' have appeared in both domestic protests and rallies among Iranian diaspora communities, signaling a resurgence of the Pahlavi dynasty\u2019s political influence. In an interview with Fox News\u2019 *Sunday Morning Futures* on January 11, 2026, Pahlavi appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump, stating that protesters view Trump as more committed to their cause than previous U.S. leaders like Barack Obama or Joe Biden, and urged him to intervene if peaceful demonstrators are killed. He has used social media to mobilize Iranians, calling for unity and demanding an end to oppression. Analysts, including those cited by the New York Times and Financial Times, note that Pahlavi has improved his political standing through image reform and sustained engagement with the diaspora, becoming the most prominent opposition figure among exiled Iranians. However, questions remain about his domestic support, as he has not lived in Iran since 1979 and critics, including the BBC and CNN, question whether Iranians are ready to accept a return to monarchy or are merely reacting against the current theocratic regime. Reuters emphasized the difficulty in assessing his actual public support inside Iran.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 05:04 AM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/english/world-en/2026/01/12/5GCVNWRJCVE7JH2RVJZVFQG53A/)\n\n**Reza Pahlavi: Ready to Return to Iran, Will Sacrifice Life for Freedom**\nReza Pahlavi, the son of former Iranian monarch Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, stated in a Fox News interview on January 12, 2026, that he is prepared to return to Iran and is ready to sacrifice his life. He emphasized that he and the Iranian people are prepared to die for a planned, stable, and peaceful transition of power, avoiding chaos like that seen in post-Saddam Iraq. Reza Pahlavi, a former fighter pilot, claimed that the Iranian people have responded positively to the idea of U.S. intervention, particularly under former President Donald Trump, whom they view as distinct from Barack Obama and Joe Biden due to his promise of peace and opposition to evil forces. He cited the naming of streets after Trump as evidence of public support and expressed hope that the 'Trump model' of leadership would endure, enabling Iran and Trump to become great again. He insisted that removing the current regime\u2014the 'head of the snake'\u2014is the only solution to eliminate threats to Iran, the U.S., and regional stability. The interview comes amid widespread protests across major Iranian cities, with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei accusing the U.S. and Israel of orchestrating the unrest. While the New York Times notes that the Pahlavi regime historically suppressed people and that many opposition figures still oppose a return to monarchy, some analysts believe Reza Pahlavi has built a growing domestic support base in recent years.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 01:54 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/10511/9259311)\n\n**Who Is Reza Pahlavi? Why Millions Of Iranians Are Heeding The Exiled Princes Call To Action**\nIn January 2026, Iran experienced an unprecedented 13-day nationwide wave of protests, marking the most significant challenge to the Islamic Republic in years. The protests intensified after a video appeal by exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the eldest son of the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who called for coordinated nightly chanting at 8:00 PM on Thursday and Friday nights. Demonstrators in Tehran, Mashhad, and Isfahan chanted slogans such as 'This is the final battle, Pahlavi will return' and 'Death to the Dictator.' The unrest was triggered by a 'sudden economic shock' following the reimposition of UN sanctions on Iran\u2019s atomic program at the end of 2025, which caused the Iranian Rial to plummet to 1.4 million per US dollar. Domestic conditions worsened with 40% inflation and the removal of subsidies on essential goods like meat, rice, and gasoline, prompting strikes by Grand Bazaar merchants. Regional experts note that Iran\u2019s 'Axis of Resistance' has been severely weakened, increasing the regime\u2019s vulnerability. In response, the government, led by President Masoud Pezeshkian, imposed a nationwide internet blackout and cut international phone lines on Thursday night. Human rights sources report at least 45 deaths and over 2,200 arrests since December 28, 2025. The US has intervened diplomatically: President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, stating the US would act if protesters were violently killed, while Republican Senator Lindsey Graham labeled Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 'a religious Nazi' and assured demonstrators that 'help is on the way.' Iran\u2019s state media blamed 'terrorist agents' of the US and Israel for the violence, and the Iranian Army chief threatened a response more robust than the June 2025 military escalation. Reza Pahlavi, born October 31, 1960, has lived in exile in the US since 1980, following his father\u2019s death, and advocates for a secular, democratic, parliamentary system rather than a monarchy, serving as a symbolic leader of the National Cooperation Platform and the Iranian opposition diaspora.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 08:34 AM\nSource:[Zee News](https://zeenews.india.com/world/iran-protests-2026-reza-pahlavi-internet-blackout-khamenei-3004851.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nIn early March 2026, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last Shah, conducted an intensive media campaign across major US outlets positioning himself as a transitional leader following the death of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in joint US-Israeli airstrikes on March 2, 2026. Here is a comprehensive overview of his interviews and coverage:\n\n## Major US Media Interviews (March 1-2, 2026)\n\n**Fox News Network (Multiple Appearances):**\nPahlavi gave several interviews to Fox News programs on March 1-2, 2026. On March 2, he appeared on *Sunday Morning Futures*, describing the strikes as \"the beginning of the very end of the regime\" and a \"full decapitation of the regime\" that would accelerate the Islamic Republic's collapse [2]. On March 1, he appeared on *Fox & Friends Weekend* with Sean Hannity, characterizing the military action as a \"humanitarian intervention\" and urging Iranians to \"finish the job\" while asking the US military to \"exercise the utmost caution to preserve civilian lives\" [10]. In these interviews, Pahlavi claimed to have the support of \"millions in Iran\" and stated that \"even the Iranian military will side with him\" [4].\n\n**60 Minutes (CBS):**\nOn March 2, 2026, Pahlavi sat down with *60 Minutes*, stating that \"millions of Iranians inside and outside Iran are calling my name\" and outlining a four-point roadmap for transition: territorial integrity, separation of religion and state, equal rights for all citizens, and free elections [1]. He emphasized that his goal was not to become a permanent ruler but to create conditions for Iranians to decide their own future through democratic means [1].\n\n**The Washington Post (Opinion Piece):**\nOn March 1, 2026, Pahlavi published an op-ed in *The Washington Post* stating, \"Many Iranians, often even after facing bullets, have called on me to lead this transition. I am in awe of their courage, and I have answered their call\" [6][7]. He detailed a specific transition plan involving a new constitution adopted by referendum, followed by free elections under international supervision, after which the transitional government would dissolve [5][8]. He pledged to \"immediately recognize\" Israel and vowed there would be \"no dissolution of institutions, no power vacuum, no chaos\" [7][8].\n\n## Iranian Diaspora Response\n\n**Support and Mobilization:**\nPahlavi has cultivated significant support among the Iranian diaspora, particularly through organizations like the National Union for Democracy in Iran (NUFDI) [16][19]. Reports indicate he has built a \"million-person audience\" on social media and is considered one of the most influential opposition voices abroad [5][7]. Following the strikes, diaspora communities demonstrated support, with references to a Global Day of Action involving over 1 million demonstrators [17]. At the Munich Security Conference in mid-February 2026, Pahlavi reportedly drew approximately 250,000 supporters to an appearance on the Theresienwiese [5], though this figure has been disputed (see below).\n\n**Critical Perspectives:**\nDespite his high profile abroad, analysts note that Pahlavi lacks a strong organizational base inside Iran, with most visible support coming from the diaspora rather than domestic networks [1]. A 2024 GAMAAN poll cited in multiple reports found that just over 30% of Iranians surveyed would support Pahlavi in a free election, though the poll does not clarify motivations [16][19].\n\n**Controversies Regarding Digital Support:**\nOne analysis from February 2026 raised serious questions about the authenticity of Pahlavi's digital support, alleging that a coordinated campaign using 356,941 bot accounts manipulated news aggregators like MSN, Google News, and Apple News to manufacture the appearance of widespread backing [20]. The report claimed that 89.54% of his Instagram followers were fake and that 55% of comments were duplicates, suggesting that \"digital amplification magnifies limited constituencies into false consensus\" [20].\n\n## Policy Positions and Transition Plan\n\nThroughout his early March media appearances, Pahlavi consistently outlined:\n- A 100-180 day \"Emergency Phase Booklet\" for stabilization post-regime collapse [17]\n- A referendum-based process for adopting a new constitution [6][14]\n- Immediate recognition of Israel [8][13]\n- Support for a secular, democratic parliamentary system rather than a restoration of monarchy [15]\n- Economic arguments claiming his leadership could generate \"over a trillion dollars worth of impact and revenue to the American economy\" by opening Iran's markets [4]\n\n## US Government Context\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been non-committal regarding Pahlavi specifically. Trump told CBS News that he is considering \"several candidates\" for Iran's leadership and stated, \"Yes, I think so. There are some good candidates,\" but did not name Pahlavi specifically [5][7]. However, US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed to Fox News that he met with Pahlavi on Trump's orders in February 2026 [9].\n\n## Limitations and Contradictions\n\nCritical coverage notes several contradictions in Pahlavi's positioning. His \"Roadmap for Iran Prosperity\" and \"Emergency Phase Booklet\" grant him extensive veto powers and selection authority during any transition, raising concerns about authoritarian tendencies despite his democratic rhetoric [16][19]. Critics also highlight that he has avoided addressing the human rights abuses and authoritarianism of his father's regime, and his supporters have shown intolerance toward dissent, including aggressive reactions to critical journalists like Christiane Amanpour [16][19].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
