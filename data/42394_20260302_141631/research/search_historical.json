Some claims (particularly regarding Khamenei's death and US-Israeli strikes on Iran) are extraordinary and should be treated with caution pending independent verification.\n\n---\n\n### Key Facts & Context\n\n- The article is dated around **March 1, 2026**, and describes a major geopolitical event: **Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei reportedly killed** following US-Israeli strikes on Iran.\n- **Reza Pahlavi** publicly declared Khamenei had been \"erased from the face of history\" and stated the Islamic Republic had effectively ended.\n- Pahlavi published an **opinion piece in The Washington Post**, introducing the **\"Iran Prosperity Project\"** \u2014 a roadmap for political transition and national recovery.\n- He called on Iran's military and security forces to abandon the regime and support a peaceful transition, warning that \"the time for a widespread and decisive presence in the streets is very near.\"\n- Pahlavi **thanked President Trump** and expressed hope for restored US-Iran ties.\n- **Maryam Rajavi** (NCRI president-elect) announced the formation of a **provisional government** and called for a democratic republic.\n- Pahlavi has previously positioned himself as a transitional (not monarchical) leader, gaining renewed public attention during Iran's 2017, 2019, and 2022 protest waves.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-883924\">\n## Summary: \"Reza Pahlavi Emerges as Central Figure in Iran\" \u2014 *The Jerusalem Post*, January 20, 2026\n\n**Author:** Professor Emeritus at Bar-Ilan University and Senior Researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS)\n\n### Core Argument\nThe article challenges the common claim that Iran's opposition movement is \"leaderless,\" using Google Trends data (searches conducted in Farsi) to argue that **Reza Pahlavi has emerged as the dominant opposition figure** among Iranians.\n\n### Key Data Points from Google Trends Analysis\n- **Five terms compared:** Ali Khamenei, Velayat-e faqih (theocratic legitimizing doctrine), Reza Pahlavi, and two other opposition figures.\n- **Since 2004:** Average search score for Pahlavi = **9**; for Khamenei = **less than 1**.\n- **Velayat-e faqih** ranked second overall (average score ~6), but its searches have **declined by half or more** over the past decade, while Pahlavi's have remained steady or increased.\n- **Past year (more recent window):** Pahlavi's average score rose to **12**, while Velayat-e faqih dropped to **1**.\n- Alternative opposition figures (e.g., Reza Shihabi, Hamed Esmaeilion) showed the **same substantial gap** behind Pahlavi.\n\n### Notable Events Affecting Trends\n- Pahlavi's popularity **surged** following the **12-day Israel-Iran war in June** (which Pahlavi publicly supported, to the displeasure of some other opposition figures).\n- A **second, even larger spike** occurred in **late December 2025**, representing the highest recent peak.\n\n### Conclusion (Author's Opinion)\nThe author concludes that the Iranian theocratic regime \u2014 led by an unpopular supreme leader, experiencing ideological erosion, and facing a widely recognized opposition leader \u2014 is **\"likely to fall sooner rather than later.\"**\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/google/\">\n## Summary of Article Content\n\n**Disclaimer:** The article appears to be an aggregated news feed (likely from CBS News) containing multiple unrelated stories rather than a single focused piece. The content is fragmented and incomplete.\n\n### Key Relevant Finding for the Question:\n\nThe article contains one directly relevant item:\n\n> **\"Prince Reza Pahlavi, a leader of the opposition to the Islamic Republic, discusses whether regime change is coming, who leads a transition, and nuclear weapons.\"**\n\nThis appears in the context of coverage surrounding a **U.S.-Israeli military operation against Iran (\"Operation Epic Fury\")**, which is described as an ongoing conflict with the following details:\n- At least **four American service members killed**\n- Three U.S. fighter jets \"mistakenly shot down by Kuwaiti air defenses\"\n- Persian Gulf allies taking hits\n- Stock markets dropping amid energy cost concerns\n- Oil prices rising sharply\n\n### Contextual Significance:\nThe mention of Reza Pahlavi is directly tied to the U.S.-Israel war on Iran storyline, suggesting he was interviewed or featured as a prominent opposition figure during this conflict \u2014 a development that could plausibly **drive increased Google search interest** in \"reza pahlavi\" during the relevant timeframe (early March 2026).\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://agsi.org/analysis/irans-2025-26-protests-in-perspective/\">\n## Article Summary\n\n**Source Quality Note:** This appears to be an analytical/academic article about Iranian protest movements. The author(s) are not explicitly named in the extracted content, though it appears to be from a policy or research publication.\n\n### Core Subject\nThe article analyzes the evolution of anti-regime protests in Iran from 1981 through early 2026, with particular focus on the December 2025\u2013February 2026 protest wave.\n\n### Key Facts & Statistics\n- **December 28, 2025**: Mass anti-government protests began in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, triggered by the collapse of the Iranian rial against the U.S. dollar\n- **Death toll estimates** for the 2025-26 protests vary dramatically:\n  - Iranian government: 3,110 deaths\n  - *New York Times*: at least 5,200\n  - Iran International TV: more than 36,500\n- **Internet blackout**: Imposed January 8, partially restored January 28\n- **2022-23 Mahsa Amini protests**: 502 protesters and 73 security forces killed\n- Eight major anti-regime protest movements have occurred since June 1981\n- Since 2017, major unrest has occurred roughly **every two to three years**\n\n### Analytical Findings\n- Protests have become more frequent, longer, geographically wider, socially more diverse, and significantly more violent over time\n- The 2025-26 protests are notable for crossing class lines (beginning with bazaar merchants, spreading broadly)\n- A **\"rally around the flag\" effect** was observed during the June 2025 Israel-U.S. bombardment of Iran, temporarily suppressing dissent\n- The article notes the regime's legitimacy has eroded sufficiently that a future military confrontation **could trigger** rather than suppress anti-regime mobilization\n\n### Relevance to \"Reza Pahlavi\" Search Interest\nThe article references **Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi** only historically, noting the Islamic Republic was \"born out of a mass protest movement\" against him. There is **no direct discussion** of his son Reza Pahlavi (the current opposition figure) or any events that would directly explain search interest spikes in his name during the March 2\u201311, 2026 window.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/12/what-we-know-about-the-protests-sweeping-iran\">\n## Summary: Al Jazeera \u2013 \"What we know about the protests sweeping Iran\"\n**Author:** Sarah Shamim | **Source:** Al Jazeera\n\n### Background & Economic Triggers\n- Protests erupted on **December 28, 2025**, initially led by shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, triggered by the Iranian rial hitting a record low (1.4 million rials to $1, compared to ~700,000 a year prior).\n- **Food prices are ~72% higher** than the previous year; annual inflation is ~40%.\n- Contributing economic factors include: a **12-day war with Israel in June 2025**, **UN re-imposition of sanctions** in September 2025, a **fuel subsidy restructuring** in December 2025, and the Central Bank scrapping a preferential dollar-rial exchange rate for most imports.\n\n### Political Dimension & Reza Pahlavi\n- Protest chants have shifted from economic grievances to **opposition to the clerical establishment**.\n- Some protesters have begun **chanting in support of Reza Pahlavi**, the exiled son of the deposed Shah, and heir to the Pahlavi monarchy.\n- Per **Maryam Alemzadeh (Associate Professor, University of Oxford):** *\"There were chants in his [Pahlavi's] support on the streets of Iran among other chants in this round of protests.\"*\n- Pahlavi himself has stated he favors a **referendum** to determine Iran's future governance structure, rather than an outright return to monarchy.\n\n### Scope & Casualties\n- Protests have spread across multiple Iranian provinces and to diaspora communities in the **US, UK, Germany, France, Turkey, and Pakistan**.\n- Iranian state media reports **more than 100 security personnel killed**; opposition activists claim the death toll is higher and includes **hundreds of protesters**. Al Jazeera could not independently verify these figures.\n- Alemzadeh warned that **\"thousands of citizens might have been killed\"** given the internet blackout limiting information flow.\n\n### Internet Shutdown & Government Response\n- Iran's internet blackout entered its **fourth day** (as of the article's writing), per watchdog **NetBlocks**.\n- Foreign Minister **Abbas Araghchi** told diplomats the internet would soon be restored and alleged protests were \"stoked and fuelled\" by foreign elements.\n- Araghchi claimed the government has video footage of weapons being distributed to protesters and said security forces would \"hunt down\" those responsible.\n\n### U.S. Involvement & Geopolitical Context\n- **President Trump** has repeatedly threatened **military intervention** if Iran violently cracks down on protesters.\n- Araghchi alleged Trump's warnings motivated \"terrorists\" to target both protesters and security forces to encourage foreign intervention.\n\n### Expert Outlook\n- Alemzadeh (Oxford) stated repression is **\"unprecedented in brutality, even with the Islamic Republic's notorious standard\"** and that grievances will not be quieted.\n- She outlined possible trajectories: internal elite fracturing, marginalization of Supreme Leader Khamenei, or US/Israeli intervention \u2014 the latter likely leading to \"chaos.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://time.com/7344936/iran-protest-reza-pahlavi-ayatollah/\">\n## Article Summary\n\n**Source:** An opinion/analysis piece critiquing Western enthusiasm for Reza Pahlavi as a potential leader of Iran's democratic transition amid ongoing protests.\n\n---\n\n### Context of the Protests\n- Protests have been ongoing for 12 days across Iran, including Tehran and smaller cities like Abadan and Malekshahi (Ilam province), driven by economic crises, unemployment, and state neglect.\n- At least **28 protesters killed** across eight provinces, per Amnesty International estimates.\n- The Iranian government has blocked internet access and intensified repressive measures, including reportedly importing Iraqi Shia militias.\n\n---\n\n### Reza Pahlavi's Role\n- Pahlavi (son of the deposed Shah) has issued statements, given interviews, called for coordinated demonstrations, and positioned himself as a leader for Iran's potential democratic transition.\n- He claims a platform where **50,000 Iranian officials have registered to defect**, though the article describes these claims as \"unverifiable and frankly implausible.\"\n- He has lived outside Iran for **48 years** (in the U.S. since age 17).\n\n---\n\n### The \"Chalabi Template\" Comparison\nThe article draws a detailed parallel to **Ahmed Chalabi**, the Iraqi exile politician backed by the U.S. before the 2003 Iraq invasion:\n- Chalabi had far superior resources (over **$100M from the CIA** in the 1990s, another **$97M** post-Iraq Liberation Act), a unified opposition organization, Kurdish ground forces, and full U.S. military backing.\n- Despite all this, Chalabi's party won **less than 0.5% of votes** in Iraq's 2005 elections and failed to win a single parliamentary seat.\n- The article argues Pahlavi has **none of Chalabi's advantages** and faces the same core problem: a **legitimacy deficit** \u2014 being perceived as a foreign-backed figure disconnected from the country.\n\n---\n\n### Pahlavi's Structural Weaknesses (per the article)\n- **No meaningful organization inside Iran** \u2014 a 2009 Brookings Institution report noted he lacked an \"organized following\" due to the absence of a serious monarchist movement; the article states this remains valid.\n- **No substantial funding** \u2014 relies on diaspora donations.\n- **No ground game** \u2014 no equivalent of Kurdish peshmerga or similar forces.\n- **No invasion force** \u2014 unlike Chalabi, there is no U.S. military intervention forthcoming; the article notes U.S. involvement would likely delegitimize any opposition figure.\n\n---\n\n### Legitimacy Concerns\n- The Pahlavi dynasty is associated with: the **1953 CIA-backed coup** overthrowing Mosaddegh, the **SAVAK secret police**, the **Rastakhiz Party**, and widespread corruption and inequality that fueled the 1979 revolution.\n- Pro-Pahlavi slogans at protests are described by the article as reflecting **nostalgia for pre-revolutionary stability**, amplified by \"social media campaigns using fake accounts and AI-generated content,\" per researchers.\n- The chant **\"Neither Shah nor clergy\"** is cited as evidence many Iranians reject both the Islamic Republic and a Pahlavi restoration.\n- **Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi** has described Pahlavi's movement as \"the opposition against the opposition.\"\n- His **2023 meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu** is cited as reinforcing the regime's narrative that protesters are tools of foreign powers.\n\n---\n\n### The Regime's Position\n- The Islamic Republic is described as more vulnerable than at any point since the 2009 Green Movement, due to currency collapse, inflation, water/energy crises, weakened regional proxies, Israeli strikes on its nuclear program, and Supreme Leader Khamenei being **86 and ailing**.\n- However, the regime retains a \"formidable repressive apparatus,\" having killed **500+ people** during the 2022\u20132023 \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" uprising, and already killing scores and arresting **2,000+** in the current unrest.\n\n---\n\n*Note: This is an opinion/analysis piece.

he remains the symbolic head of the Pahlavi dynasty.\n\n### Recent Political Activity & Positioning\n- Following **Israeli air strikes in 2025** that killed senior Iranian generals, Pahlavi declared at a Paris press conference that he was prepared to help lead a **transitional government** if the Islamic Republic collapsed, and outlined a **100-day plan** for an interim administration.\n- He presents himself as a figurehead for **national reconciliation**, not a king-in-waiting, advocating for free elections and a national referendum on Iran's political system.\n- He has consistently **rejected violence** and distanced himself from armed groups like the MEK.\n\n### Domestic Iranian Interest\n- Chants referencing his grandfather (\"Reza Shah, may your soul be blessed\") resurfaced during **2017 anti-government protests**.\n- The **2022 killing of Mahsa Amini** reignited nationwide protests and brought Pahlavi back into the media spotlight.\n- As of January 2026, **demonstrators in Iran** have been chanting for his return, and Pahlavi has called on people to take to the streets.\n\n### Controversies & Criticisms\n- A **1980 symbolic coronation** in Cairo (declaring himself shah) is cited by critics as undermining his democratic reform message.\n- A **2023 visit to Israel**, including a meeting with PM Netanyahu and attendance at a Holocaust memorial, polarized opinion among Iranians.\n- In a **BBC interview with Laura Kuenssberg**, he stated that \"anything that weakens the regime\" would be welcomed by Iranians inside Iran when asked about Israeli strikes risking civilian lives \u2014 remarks that sparked significant debate.\n- Critics argue he lacks a durable organization or independent media presence after four decades abroad, and question his dependence on foreign backing.\n\n### Broader Context\n- His true support inside Iran is **impossible to measure** without an open political space and credible polling.\n- Previous coalition-building efforts (e.g., the **National Council of Iran for Free Elections**, launched 2013) struggled with internal disagreements and limited domestic reach.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/reza-pahlavi-iran-60-minutes-video-2026-03-01/\">\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted content from this article is severely incomplete.

Availability and technical constraints  \n\u2022 Google Trends only exposes daily data for windows of \u2264270 days in the public web interface; longer horizons are down-sampled to weekly or monthly points (Evilworks blog, source).  \n\u2022 The data are normalised separately for each request (values are rescaled so the peak in the requested window equals 100), which means multi-window pulls must later be re-normalised to make a coherent time-series (Evilworks blog; Google Developers blog 24 Jul 2025 announcing the alpha API).  \n\u2022 The GitHub projects by \u201cbenhm1\u201d (google-trends-downloader) and by Arunesh Tamboli as well as the pytrends Python package provide working code that (a) download successive \u226475-day windows, (b) calculate overlap-based scaling factors, and (c) stitch the windows into one consistent daily series (benhm1 GitHub; Arunesh Tamboli GitHub; pytrends package description).  \n\u2022 Google launched an official Trends API (alpha) in July 2025 that returns \u201cconsistently scaled\u201d data for up to five years back, obviating some of the manual rescaling, but access is still limited-entry (Google Developers blog 24 Jul 2025).  Unless alpha access has been granted, the unofficial workflow above remains necessary.\n\n2. What the existing public information tells us about Reza Pahlavi search interest in the target period  \nThe news coverage confirms that Reza Pahlavi received repeated search spikes in the US over the past two years, chiefly around:  \n\u2022 The \u201c12-day war\u201d between Iran and Israel in June 2025 and the related US-based commentary (Jerusalem Post, 20 Jan 2026)  \n\u2022 The death of Iran\u2019s president Ebrahim Raisi (May 2025) and the subsequent snap election cycle (Iran International, 17 Jun 2024; Jerusalem Post, 20 Jan 2026)  \n\u2022 A fresh spike in late February 2026 that set the rolling-30-day scale to 100 as of 1 Mar 2026 (LatestLY, 1 Mar 2026; verification URL in the market question)  \n\nThese episodic surges strongly suggest that a daily series will exhibit many >3-point jumps, but the exact count cannot be asserted until the raw numbers are downloaded.\n\n3. Statistics that can be produced once the daily series is secured  \nAfter stitching a coherent daily series one can compute:  \n\u2022 N = 791 daily observations (1 Jan 2024 \u2013 29 Feb 2026, inclusive; leap year 2024 adds 366 days, 2025 has 365, plus 59 days of 2026)  \n\u2022 Mean, median, standard deviation, min, max of the 0\u2013100 scores.  \n\u2022 Day-to-day absolute difference \u0394t = |value t \u2013 value t-1| for t = 2\u2026N, then  \n   \u2013 Count of \u0394t > 3  \n   \u2013 Share = (count)/(N-1)  \n\nThose are the summary statistics requested in the original brief.\n\n4. Information still missing  \nDespite the methodological material retrieved, the key input\u2014the actual day-level numeric series for Reza Pahlavi (US, 2024-01-01 \u2192 2026-02-29)\u2014has not yet been located in a published dataset.

Next step required to close the gap  \nAn automated pull using either:  \n\u2022 pytrends\u2019 get_historical_interest() in 75-day rolling windows with 30-day overlaps, followed by overlap-based rescaling as per the benhm1 or Evilworks recipes; or  \n\u2022 If access is available, a single call to the new Google Trends alpha API requesting daily aggregation for the term id \u201c/m/05v6n4x\u201d (Reza Pahlavi topic) over the date span and geo=US.  \n\nExecuting either method will yield the csv needed for final computations.\n\nConclusion  \nThe literature and tools needed to build the daily US Google-search time-series are well mapped and cited, but the numerical series itself remains to be downloaded. Until that dataset is in hand, the requested statistics\u2014the exact mean, variance, and the tally of >3-point day-over-day moves for 1 Jan 2024 \u2013 29 Feb 2026\u2014cannot be produced.</Agent_report>\n"
