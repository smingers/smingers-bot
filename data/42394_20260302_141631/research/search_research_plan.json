  "plan_analysis": "This forecast hinges on whether the Google Trends daily value for \u201creza pahlavi\u201d (US, fixed range 2026-02-09 to 2026-03-11) moves by >3 points between  03-02 and 03-11 UTC.  \nWhat we already know:  \n\u2022 Current value on 2026-03-01 is 100 (peak for last 30 days).  \nGaps a forecaster still needs to fill:  \n1. Base-rate / volatility: How often do daily changes for this term exceed 3 points? Knowing the historical distribution of single-day swings in the last 1\u20132 years gives probabilistic grounding for \u201cDoesn\u2019t change\u201d vs the two directional options.  \n2. Resolution mechanics & current benchmark: Exact daily value for 03-02 once the new day is recorded, and the locked scaling URL.  \n3. Key drivers: What typically creates spikes or drops in interest for Reza Pahlavi (e.g., protests in Iran, regime news, interviews, US press appearances)?  \n4. Current state / upcoming catalysts between now and 03-11: Any scheduled speeches, anniversaries (1979 revolution events, Nowruz prep), media appearances, or breaking Iran news that could move search interest.  \n5. Contrarian check: Evidence of an imminent lull or of saturation after a recent peak which might make a >3-point fall more likely.",
