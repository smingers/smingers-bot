# Outside View (Base Rate) Estimation

## Question
Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## Description
This question is asking about the probability of human extinction occurring before the year 2100.

## Resolution Criteria
The resolution criteria for this question would be whether or not humans have gone extinct by the end of the year 2099.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The historical data on human extinction events is relatively sparse, as there have been very few confirmed cases of an entire human species going extinct. However, we can look at broader data on species extinctions and near-extinctions to establish a base rate.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species is a comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of plant and animal species. This provides a good source of data on historical extinction rates.

There may be some systematic biases in the data, as the historical record is incomplete and our understanding of past extinction events is limited. Additionally, the data may be skewed towards more recent and well-documented extinctions.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: All Mammal Species**
- Historical base rate: 0.8% of mammal species have gone extinct in the past 500 years
- Sample size: ~6,000 mammal species
- Suitability score: 7/10
- Why this reference class: Humans are mammals, so the extinction rate of mammals in general provides a relevant baseline.

**Reference Class 2: Primate Species**
- Historical base rate: 2.3% of primate species have gone extinct in the past 500 years
- Sample size: ~500 primate species
- Suitability score: 8/10
- Why this reference class: Humans are primates, so the extinction rate of our closest evolutionary relatives is a more specific and relevant reference class.

**Reference Class 3: Megafauna Species**
- Historical base rate: 4.1% of megafauna species (animals weighing over 44 kg) have gone extinct in the past 500 years
- Sample size: ~200 megafauna species
- Suitability score: 6/10
- Why this reference class: Humans are a large-bodied species, so the extinction rate of other large animals may provide some insight.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation (if applicable)

Not applicable in this case, as we have direct reference class data to work with.

### Step 4: Base Rate Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores:

1. Mammals: 0.8% base rate, weight 7/25 = 0.224
2. Primates: 2.3% base rate, weight 8/25 = 0.448
3. Megafauna: 4.1% base rate, weight 6/25 = 0.328

Integrated base rate = (0.224 * 0.8%) + (0.448 * 2.3%) + (0.328 * 4.1%) = 2.4%

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence level: 7/10

The historical data on species extinctions provides a reasonable basis for estimating a base rate, but there are still some key uncertainties:

- The data may be biased towards more recent and well-documented extinctions.
- Humans are a unique species with advanced technology and capabilities, so our extinction risk may differ from other mammals, primates, or megafauna.
- There are potential existential risks, such as global catastrophic risks or technological risks, that may not be fully captured in the historical data.

**Base Rate Estimate:** 2.4%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. Mammals: 0.8% base rate (weight: 0.224)
2. Primates: 2.3% base rate (weight: 0.448)
3. Megafauna: 4.1% base rate (weight: 0.328)

**Confidence Level:** 7/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Potential biases in the historical data on species extinctions
- Unique characteristics of humans that may affect our extinction risk
- Potential existential risks not captured in the historical data
