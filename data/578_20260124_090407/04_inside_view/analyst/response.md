# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

## Source Analysis
The evidence gathered covers a range of recent developments and expert analyses on the likelihood of human extinction. The sources appear credible, coming from reputable outlets like Wikipedia, scientific journals, and news media. The information spans both historical context and forward-looking projections, providing a comprehensive view on the topic.

The most recent information is from 2026, which is quite timely and relevant for assessing the current situation. There does not appear to be any clear bias in the reporting, as the sources present a balanced mix of perspectives on the risks of human extinction.

Some of the evidence, such as the background extinction rates and historical mass extinction events, is likely already factored into the base rate. However, the more recent developments and expert analyses provide new information that should be incorporated.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- Multiple sources indicate that the current rate of species extinction is much higher than the natural background rate, with estimates of up to 30,000 species being driven to extinction per year due to human activity. This suggests a heightened risk of a mass extinction event.
- Experts predict that climate change could cause up to a third of all species to go extinct by 2100, which would have severe implications for human survival.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- Historical data shows that human populations have experienced dramatic declines in the past, with evidence of a 99% population loss around 900,000 years ago. This indicates the fragility of the human species.
- Mathematical models have predicted that a sixth mass extinction event is likely to occur due to the impacts of climate change and human activity.

**WEAK Evidence**
- Anecdotal reports of public concern about the potential for human extinction due to climate change, with a quarter of surveyed Americans believing it is somewhat or very likely.
- Speculation about a mass extinction event in 250 million years due to extreme heat and rising CO2 levels, which is beyond the scope of this question.

## Evidence Update Reasoning

**STRONG Evidence Pushing UP:**
- The evidence on the current elevated rates of species extinction and projections of climate change-driven mass extinctions suggests a significantly higher risk of human extinction compared to the base rate. This pushes the probability up by approximately 10-15 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence Pushing UP:**
- The historical precedents of dramatic human population declines and mathematical models predicting a sixth mass extinction event provide additional context for the fragility of the human species. This pushes the probability up by approximately 5-10 percentage points.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- The anecdotal public concerns and speculative long-term projections do not significantly alter the assessment beyond the stronger evidence. These are largely already captured in the base rate or other updates.

## Integration

Starting from 2.4%:
- Adjustment 1: +12.5% for the strong evidence on elevated extinction rates and climate change-driven mass extinctions
- Adjustment 2: +7.5% for the moderate evidence on historical population declines and mathematical models
- Adjustment 3: +0% for the weak evidence

**Cumulative adjustment:** +20%

## Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the final probability were to be below 10%, it would imply that the current evidence is severely underestimating the risk of human extinction, which seems highly unlikely given the strong and moderate evidence pointing to the contrary.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 20% adjustment from the base rate is substantial but justified given the compelling evidence on the heightened extinction risks facing humanity.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strong evidence leading to a larger adjustment than the moderate evidence.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability of 22.4% does not represent an extreme prediction, so regression to the mean is not a significant concern.

## Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, the evidence gathered paints a concerning picture for the risk of human extinction before 2100. The strong evidence on the current elevated rates of species extinction, combined with expert projections of climate change-driven mass extinctions, suggests a significantly higher probability of human extinction compared to the base rate.

The moderate evidence on historical precedents of dramatic human population declines and mathematical models predicting a sixth mass extinction event further reinforces the fragility of the human species and the plausibility of such an outcome.

While the weak evidence, such as public concerns and speculative long-term projections, does not significantly alter the assessment, the cumulative weight of the strong and moderate evidence points to a substantial increase in the probability of human extinction before 2100.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Elevated rates of species extinction, climate change-driven mass extinctions
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 2.4%
- Total adjustment: +20%
- Final estimate: 22.4%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 22.4%**
