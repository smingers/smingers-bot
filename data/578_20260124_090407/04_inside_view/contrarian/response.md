# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what could make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question
Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## Resolution Criteria


## Base Rate from Outside View
**Starting Point:** 2.4%

**Total Sources:** 29

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence gathered covers a range of recent and historical information on human extinction risk, including scientific studies, news reports, and expert analyses. The sources appear to be credible, coming from reputable institutions and publications. However, there are some potential biases to consider:

- The news reports may be sensationalized or focused on more extreme scenarios.
- Some of the scientific studies may have methodological limitations or focus on narrow aspects of the problem.
- The historical data on past mass extinctions may not be directly applicable to the current human situation.

Additionally, it's unclear how much of this information is already priced into the base rate of 2.4%. Some of the evidence, such as the background extinction rates and historical examples, may have already been factored in.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- [Evidence 1]: Recent scientific studies suggesting that up to a third of species could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change. This provides a strong causal mechanism for human extinction risk.
- [Evidence 2]: Historical examples of mass extinctions in Earth's past, which could set a precedent for a similar event occurring in the future.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- [Evidence 1]: Polls showing that a significant portion of the public believes climate change could lead to human extinction. This indirectly suggests a heightened level of concern, but does not provide a clear causal mechanism.
- [Evidence 2]: Analyses suggesting that human activity is currently causing a "sixth mass extinction" event. This provides a potential precedent, but the causal links are not as clear.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- [Evidence 1]: Speculation about a potential mass extinction event in 250 million years due to extreme heat and rising CO2 levels. This is too distant in the future to be highly relevant to the 2100 timeframe.
- [Evidence 2]: Anecdotal reports of cities being lost to rising sea levels. While concerning, this does not directly imply human extinction.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence:**
- [Evidence 1]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 10-15 percentage points, as the risk of widespread species loss due to climate change is a significant threat to human survival.
- [Evidence 2]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 5-10 percentage points, as the precedent of past mass extinctions suggests a heightened risk of a similar event occurring in the future.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- [Evidence 1]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 2-5 percentage points, as the public concern suggests a greater awareness of the issue, but does not provide a clear causal mechanism.
- [Evidence 2]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 2-5 percentage points, as the potential for a "sixth mass extinction" indicates an elevated risk, but the causal links are not as well-established.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- [Evidence 1]: This does not significantly impact the probability, as the 250 million year timeframe is too distant to be highly relevant.
- [Evidence 2]: This does not significantly impact the probability, as the loss of cities to rising sea levels, while concerning, does not directly imply human extinction.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 2.4%:
- Adjustment 1: +12.5% for the strong evidence of climate change-driven species loss
- Adjustment 2: +7.5% for the strong evidence of past mass extinctions
- Adjustment 3: +3.5% for the moderate evidence of public concern and potential "sixth mass extinction"
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +23.5%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is above 25%, it would mean that the evidence strongly suggests a high likelihood of human extinction before 2100, which would be a very dire scenario. This would require the climate change impacts to be even more severe than currently projected, or for a previously unforeseen catastrophic event to occur.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 2.4% is based on a broader set of reference classes, including all mammal, primate, and megafauna species. As a contrarian, I believe the current evidence suggests that the human species may be at a higher risk of extinction compared to this broader group, due to the unique threats we face from climate change and other human-driven environmental impacts.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates I've made are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence leading to the largest adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not making overly large adjustments from the base rate. My final estimate remains within a reasonable range, considering the potential for uncertainty and the tendency for predictions to revert towards the mean.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I believe the current evidence suggests that the base rate of 2.4% for human extinction before 2100 may be an underestimate. While the base rate is based on a broader set of reference classes, the unique threats facing humanity, such as the potential for widespread species loss due to climate change and the precedent of past mass extinctions, indicate that the human species may be at a higher risk of extinction compared to other mammals, primates, and megafauna.

The strong evidence of climate change-driven species loss and the historical precedent of mass extinctions provide a clear causal mechanism for why human extinction could occur. Additionally, the moderate evidence of public concern and the potential for a "sixth mass extinction" event suggests a heightened awareness and risk, even if the causal links are not as well-established.

While the evidence does not point to an extremely high likelihood of human extinction before 2100, the cumulative adjustments suggest that the probability is likely higher than the initial base rate. My final estimate, incorporating the contrarian perspective, is that the probability of humans going extinct before 2100 is approximately 25.9%.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Climate change-driven species loss, precedent of past mass extinctions
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 2.4%
- Total adjustment: +23.5%
- Final estimate: 25.9%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 25.9%**
