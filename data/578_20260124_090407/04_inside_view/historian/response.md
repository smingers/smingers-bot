# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: historian
You are a historian and superforecaster. Focus on historical precedents, analogous situations, and patterns from the past. Consider how often similar situations have resolved in various ways. Use history to inform your probability estimate.

**Total Sources:** 29

## Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence provided covers a range of historical and current information related to human extinction and mass extinction events. The sources appear to be credible, with information from reputable scientific publications, news outlets, and government/academic institutions. The evidence spans a wide timeframe, from ancient human population declines to modern predictions of future extinction risks.

The key strengths of the evidence are:
- Robust historical data on past mass extinction events and species loss rates
- Detailed analyses of the factors contributing to extinction risks, such as climate change, habitat loss, and human activity
- Expert opinions and scientific models forecasting potential future extinction scenarios

The main limitations are:
- Some of the evidence, while informative, may already be priced into the base rate (e.g., general background extinction rates)
- There is a mix of short-term and long-term projections, which could make it challenging to assess the near-term extinction risk by 2100
- Potential biases in media reporting or selective publication of certain extinction narratives

Overall, the evidence provides a solid foundation for adjusting the base rate, but requires careful synthesis and consideration of the specific relevance to the 2100 timeframe.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- Historical data on mass extinction events and species loss rates, indicating that human activity is driving a potential sixth mass extinction event (e.g., "There have been five major mass extinctions in the past 541 Myr51,52, with many arguing that human activity is currently causing a sixth2.")
- Scientific models and expert analyses predicting a significant proportion of species (up to one-third) could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change and other human-driven factors (e.g., "A biologist at the University of Connecticut has found evidence that up to a third of all species alive today could go extinct by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.")

**MODERATE Evidence**
- Analyses of historical human population declines, suggesting the potential for future severe population losses (e.g., "Our ancestors lost nearly 99% of their population, 900,000 years ago.")
- Projections of long-term (e.g., 250 million years) mass extinction events due to climate change and other factors, which may be less directly relevant to the 2100 timeframe

**WEAK Evidence**
- Anecdotal reports or speculative predictions of human extinction, without clear supporting evidence (e.g., "Scientists have predicted a mass extinction on Earth in 250 million years, wiping out all mammals due to extreme heat and rising CO2 levels.")
- Volatile indicators, such as public opinion polls on the likelihood of human extinction, which may not accurately reflect the underlying risks

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence Pushing UP**
- Historical data on mass extinction events and species loss rates indicate a significant risk of a potential sixth mass extinction event driven by human activity. This suggests the probability of human extinction by 2100 may be higher than the base rate.
- Scientific models and expert analyses predicting up to one-third of species could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change and other human-driven factors further support an upward adjustment from the base rate.

**MODERATE Evidence Pushing DOWN**
- Historical human population declines, while concerning, may be less directly relevant to the 2100 timeframe and could already be reflected in the base rate.
- Projections of long-term (250 million years) mass extinction events, while important to consider, may not be as applicable to the near-term 2100 timeframe.

**WEAK Evidence - No Adjustment**
- Anecdotal reports or speculative predictions of human extinction, without clear supporting evidence, do not warrant a significant adjustment to the base rate.
- Volatile indicators, such as public opinion polls, are not considered reliable enough to adjust the base rate.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from the base rate of 2.4%:

Adjustment 1: +10% for the strong historical evidence on mass extinction events and the potential for a sixth mass extinction driven by human activity.
Adjustment 2: +5% for the strong scientific models and expert analyses predicting up to one-third of species could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change and other human-driven factors.

Cumulative adjustment: +15%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the final probability estimate is very low (<10%) or very high (>90%), it would require an extremely unlikely scenario, such as either a complete reversal of current trends in environmental degradation and climate change, or a catastrophic, near-term collapse of human civilization and technological capabilities.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 15% adjustment from the base rate of 2.4% is justified by the strong historical and scientific evidence pointing to a significant risk of human extinction by 2100, beyond what is already captured in the base rate.

3. **Update magnitude:** The 10% and 5% adjustments for the strong evidence are proportional to the strength of the evidence and its relevance to the 2100 timeframe.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability estimate of 17.4% does not represent an extreme prediction, and the adjustments made are within a reasonable range, considering the potential for regression to the mean.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a historian and superforecaster, I have carefully considered the historical precedents, analogous situations, and patterns from the past to inform my probability estimate for human extinction before 2100.

The strong historical evidence on past mass extinction events and the current potential for a sixth mass extinction driven by human activity is a significant factor pushing the probability higher than the base rate. The scientific models and expert analyses predicting up to one-third of species could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change and other human-driven factors further support this upward adjustment.

While there is some moderate evidence on historical human population declines and long-term extinction projections, these factors are less directly relevant to the 2100 timeframe and may already be reflected in the base rate. The weak evidence, such as anecdotal reports and volatile indicators, does not warrant further adjustment.

Overall, the strong historical precedents and scientific evidence point to a heightened risk of human extinction by 2100, warranting a 15% upward adjustment from the base rate. This results in a final probability estimate of 17.4%, which I believe is a reasonable and well-justified assessment based on my role as a historian and superforecaster.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Historical data on mass extinction events, scientific models and expert analyses predicting significant species loss by 2100
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 2.4%
- Total adjustment: +15%
- Final estimate: 17.4%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 17.4%**
