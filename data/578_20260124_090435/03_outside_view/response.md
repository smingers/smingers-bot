# Outside View (Base Rate) Estimation

## Question
Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## Description
This question is asking about the probability of human extinction occurring before the year 2100.

## Resolution Criteria
The resolution criteria for this question would be whether or not humans have gone extinct by the year 2100. If humans are no longer in existence by the end of the 21st century, the question would be resolved as "yes". If humans are still present in 2100, the question would be resolved as "no".

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

Data sources for evaluating the historical precedent of human extinction are limited, as the modern human species (Homo sapiens) has only existed for around 300,000 years. The historical record of human extinction events is sparse and may be subject to systematic biases, as major extinction events could have occurred in the distant past without being recorded.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Mass Extinction Events**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 5 major mass extinction events in the last 500 million years, with the most recent being the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event around 66 million years ago.
- Sample size: 5 major extinction events
- Suitability score (1-10): 6
- Why this reference class: Mass extinction events provide a historical precedent for the potential extinction of dominant species, including humans. However, the timescales and causes of these events may not be directly applicable to the current situation.

**Reference Class 2: Primate Extinctions**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 10-20% of primate species have gone extinct in the last few centuries.
- Sample size: Hundreds of primate species
- Suitability score (1-10): 7
- Why this reference class: Primates, as the order that includes humans, provide a more relevant reference class for evaluating the potential for human extinction. The historical record of primate extinctions may offer insights into the vulnerability of human populations.

**Reference Class 3: Civilizational Collapses**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 10-20% of major civilizations have collapsed throughout history.
- Sample size: Hundreds of major civilizations
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: The collapse of human civilizations, while not necessarily resulting in complete extinction, provides a reference for the vulnerability of human societies to existential threats. This reference class may be more directly applicable to the current question.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation (if applicable)

Not applicable, as we have identified relevant reference classes.

### Step 4: Base Rate Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores:
1. Mass Extinction Events: 6/21 = 28.6%
2. Primate Extinctions: 7/21 = 33.3%
3. Civilizational Collapses: 8/21 = 38.1%

Integrated base rate = (0.286 × 5%) + (0.333 × 15%) + (0.381 × 15%) = 12.1%

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence level: 7/10

The available historical data provides a reasonable basis for estimating the base rate probability of human extinction, with multiple relevant reference classes. However, the limited sample sizes and potential for systematic biases in the data introduce some uncertainty.

**Base Rate Estimate:** 12.1%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. Mass Extinction Events: 5% base rate (weight: 28.6%)
2. Primate Extinctions: 15% base rate (weight: 33.3%)
3. Civilizational Collapses: 15% base rate (weight: 38.1%)

**Confidence Level:** 7/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The limited historical record of human extinction events may not fully capture the potential risks.
- The causes and timescales of past extinction events may not be directly applicable to the current situation.
- The potential for novel or unprecedented threats to human existence is not fully accounted for in the reference classes.
