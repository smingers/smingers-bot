# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

## Question
Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## Description
The task is to adjust a base rate of 12.1% for the probability of humans going extinct before 2100, based on current evidence.

## Resolution Criteria
The final probability estimate should be a number between 0.1% and 99.9%.

## Base Rate from Outside View
**Starting Point:** 12.1%
**Reference Classes Used:** Mass Extinction Events, Primate Extinctions, Civilizational Collapses
**Confidence in Base Rate:** 7/10

## Current Research
# Research Synthesis

**Generated:** 2026-01-24T09:04:39.955884+00:00
**Total Sources:** 27

## Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence gathered is relatively recent, with the majority of the sources being from the past 5 years. The sources appear to be from credible news outlets, academic institutions, and reputable online platforms. There is no obvious bias in the reporting, and the information does not seem to be already priced into the base rate.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: A study predicting that 27% of vertebrate diversity will vanish by 2100 due to climate change and other environmental factors. This suggests a significant risk of human extinction within the same timeframe.
- [Evidence 2]: Statements from experts, including a Stanford epidemiologist, that human extinction is a real possibility by 2100 if certain catastrophic events occur.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Estimates from experts that the median probability of human extinction by 2100 is around 6%, with a 20% chance of a catastrophic event before the end of the century.
- [Evidence 2]: Projections that a third of Earth's species could become extinct by 2100 if climate change continues unabated, which could have cascading effects on human survival.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Anecdotal discussions and speculation about the timeline of human extinction, ranging from the near future to millions of years from now.
- [Evidence 2]: A study predicting human extinction in 314 years, which seems highly speculative and not well-supported.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 10-15 percentage points, as the scale of projected biodiversity loss suggests a significant risk to human survival.
- [Evidence 2]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 5-10 percentage points, as expert assessments of the possibility of human extinction by 2100 are concerning.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 2-5 percentage points, as the median expert estimate of 6% probability provides a reasonable upper bound.
- [Evidence 2]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 2-5 percentage points, as the potential for a third of species to go extinct could have severe consequences for human survival.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: This does not significantly update the probability, as the anecdotal nature and lack of clear causal mechanisms make it difficult to quantify the impact.
- [Evidence 2]: This does not significantly update the probability, as the highly speculative nature of the study and lack of corroborating evidence make it difficult to rely on.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 12.1%:
- Adjustment 1: +12.5% for the strong evidence of significant biodiversity loss and expert assessments of human extinction risk by 2100.
- Adjustment 2: +4% for the moderate evidence of expert probability estimates and potential cascading effects of species extinctions.
- Adjustment 3: +0% for the weak evidence, which does not significantly update the probability.
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +16.5%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the final probability is very low (<10%), it would imply that the current evidence is being significantly underweighted, and that there are likely strong mitigating factors or reasons for human resilience that have not been accounted for. Conversely, if the final probability is very high (>90%), it would suggest that the evidence is being overly weighted and that the possibility of human survival by 2100 is being severely discounted.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 16.5% adjustment from the base rate of 12.1% seems justified given the strong and moderate evidence gathered, which points to a significant risk of human extinction by 2100.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates to the base rate are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strong evidence leading to a larger adjustment and the moderate evidence leading to a smaller but still meaningful adjustment.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability estimate of 28.6% does not represent an extreme prediction, and the tendency for such predictions to miss has been accounted for by not overly weighting the weak evidence and by anchoring the adjustment to the base rate.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have carefully reviewed the current evidence on the risk of human extinction before 2100. The strong evidence, including projections of significant biodiversity loss and expert assessments of the possibility of human extinction within this timeframe, suggests that the base rate of 12.1% should be adjusted upwards significantly.

The moderate evidence, such as expert probability estimates and the potential cascading effects of species extinctions, further reinforces the view that the risk of human extinction by 2100 is substantial. While the weak evidence, consisting of more speculative discussions and a highly questionable study, does not significantly update the probability, the cumulative weight of the strong and moderate evidence points to a meaningful increase in the risk of human extinction before the end of the century.

Considering all the evidence and reasoning through the various steps, I have adjusted the base rate of 12.1% upwards by 16.5 percentage points, resulting in a final probability estimate of 28.6%. This adjustment reflects the concerning trends and expert assessments regarding the potential for human extinction, while also accounting for the need to avoid overly extreme predictions and to remain anchored to the base rate.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Projections of significant biodiversity loss and expert assessments of human extinction risk by 2100
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 12.1%
- Total adjustment: +16.5%
- Final estimate: 28.6%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 28.6%**
