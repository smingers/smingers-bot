# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what might make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question
Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## Resolution Criteria


## Base Rate from Outside View
**Starting Point:** 12.1%
**Reference Classes Used:** Mass Extinction Events, Primate Extinctions, Civilizational Collapses
**Confidence in Base Rate:** 7/10

## Current Research
# Research Synthesis

**Generated:** 2026-01-24T09:04:39.955884+00:00
**Total Sources:** 27

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence presented covers a range of recent sources, from news articles to scientific studies. The sources seem credible, including reputable publications like Scientific American and Vox. However, there is a potential bias towards more sensational or alarming narratives, which could push the estimates of extinction risk upwards.

The most recent information is from 2023, so the evidence is fairly current, but does not fully capture the latest developments and trends. Some of the information may already be priced into the base rate.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: A supercomputer study predicting 27% of vertebrate diversity will vanish by 2100. This provides a clear, data-driven projection of significant biodiversity loss, which could indirectly threaten human survival.
- [Evidence 2]: Estimates from experts that put a 6% median probability of human extinction by 2100, and a 20% probability of a catastrophic event. This provides a direct assessment of extinction risk from knowledgeable sources.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Projections that a third of Earth's species could become extinct by 2100 due to climate change. This suggests a concerning trend, but the specific link to human extinction is less direct.
- [Evidence 2]: Discussions around the inevitability of human extinction at some point, even if the timing is uncertain. This provides context, but does not directly address the 2100 timeframe.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Anecdotal speculation about when humanity might go extinct, without clear supporting evidence.
- [Evidence 2]: Optimistic scenarios suggesting human population and living standards could continue to improve, potentially reducing extinction risk. This is speculative and does not directly address the 2100 timeframe.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence pointing UP:**
- The supercomputer study predicting 27% of vertebrate diversity loss by 2100 suggests a significant threat to the broader ecosystem, which could indirectly increase the risk of human extinction. This pushes the probability UP by approximately 5 percentage points.
- The expert estimates of a 6% median probability of human extinction by 2100, and a 20% probability of a catastrophic event, provide a direct assessment of extinction risk that pushes the probability UP by approximately 8 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence pointing DOWN:**
- The projections of a third of Earth's species becoming extinct by 2100 due to climate change, while concerning, do not directly translate to human extinction. This evidence is already somewhat captured in the base rate, so the update is neutral.
- The discussions around the inevitability of human extinction at some point, even if the timing is uncertain, do not provide specific information about the 2100 timeframe. This evidence is also already captured in the base rate, so the update is neutral.

**WEAK Evidence:** 
The anecdotal speculation and optimistic scenarios do not provide strong enough evidence to warrant an adjustment to the probability.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 12.1%:
- Adjustment 1: +5% for the supercomputer study predicting significant biodiversity loss
- Adjustment 2: +8% for the expert estimates of extinction and catastrophic event probabilities
- Cumulative adjustment: +13%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to be below 10%, it would imply that the current evidence is significantly overstating the extinction risk, and that there are strong mitigating factors or reasons for optimism that have not been captured. Conversely, if the probability were above 90%, it would suggest that the evidence is heavily biased towards the most catastrophic scenarios, and that the base rate and other moderating factors have been largely ignored.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 12.1% is based on a broad set of reference classes, including mass extinction events, primate extinctions, and civilizational collapses. While a 13 percentage point increase from the base rate is significant, it can be justified by the strong evidence pointing towards elevated extinction risk in the 2100 timeframe.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates made to the base rate are proportional to the strength of the evidence. The strong evidence pushing the probability up accounts for a 13 percentage point increase, which seems reasonable given the credibility and directness of the sources.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have considered the tendency for extreme predictions to miss, and have tried to balance the strong evidence pointing towards elevated extinction risk with the need to avoid overly alarmist forecasts.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. In this case, the base rate of 12.1% for human extinction before 2100 seems to be on the low side, given the current evidence.

The strong evidence from the supercomputer study and expert assessments suggests that the extinction risk may be significantly higher than the base rate indicates. The projected loss of biodiversity and the direct estimates of extinction and catastrophic event probabilities are concerning and point to a more serious threat than the consensus view.

At the same time, I acknowledge that there may be some bias towards more sensational or alarming narratives in the evidence presented. The moderate evidence, while not directly pushing the probability down, suggests that the link between broader environmental changes and human extinction is not as straightforward as the strong evidence may imply.

Ultimately, I believe the balance of the evidence points to a higher probability of human extinction before 2100 than the base rate suggests. While I don't want to be overly alarmist, the strong evidence from credible sources is difficult to ignore. I would adjust the probability upwards by 13 percentage points, resulting in a final estimate of 25.1%.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Supercomputer study predicting significant biodiversity loss, expert estimates of extinction and catastrophic event probabilities
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 12.1%
- Total adjustment: +13%
- Final estimate: 25.1%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

Probability: 25.1%
