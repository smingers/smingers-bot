**Total Sources:** 27

## Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence gathered covers a range of recent news, studies, and expert opinions on the likelihood of human extinction by 2100. The information appears to be relatively current, with many sources from the last few years. The sources seem credible, coming from reputable publications and scientific journals. There does not appear to be significant bias in the reporting, with a mix of perspectives and conclusions.

Some of the information, such as estimates of species loss and civilizational collapse, may already be partially reflected in the base rate of 12.1%. However, the specific focus on human extinction by 2100 provides additional relevant evidence.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: A study published in 2023 predicts that 27% of vertebrate diversity will vanish by 2100 due to climate change and other environmental factors, suggesting a significant risk to human survival.
- [Evidence 2]: Multiple sources, including scientific articles and expert interviews, indicate that human extinction cannot be ruled out as a possibility, given the potential for catastrophic events such as pandemics, nuclear war, or environmental collapse.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Estimates that 10% of all plant and animal species will disappear by 2050, which could have cascading effects on human populations and the ecosystems we depend on.
- [Evidence 2]: Historical precedents of mass extinction events and civilizational collapses, which suggest that human societies are not immune to such catastrophic outcomes.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Speculation and anecdotal reports about the potential timeline of human extinction, ranging from 314 years to 1 million years in the future.
- [Evidence 2]: Optimistic projections about technological progress and economic growth mitigating the risks of human extinction, which may not fully account for the complexity and uncertainty of future challenges.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence Pushing UP**
- [Evidence 1]: The prediction of 27% vertebrate diversity loss by 2100 is a strong indicator of the potential for significant disruption to human systems, pushing the probability up by approximately 10 percentage points.
- [Evidence 2]: The acknowledgment that human extinction cannot be ruled out, given the risk of catastrophic events, pushes the probability up by around 5 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence Pushing UP**
- [Evidence 1]: The projected 10% species loss by 2050 suggests a concerning trend, pushing the probability up by approximately 3 percentage points.
- [Evidence 2]: Historical precedents of mass extinctions and civilizational collapses indicate that human societies are vulnerable to such events, pushing the probability up by around 2 percentage points.

**WEAK Evidence (No Significant Update)**
- [Evidence 1]: The speculative timelines for human extinction do not provide enough concrete evidence to warrant a significant adjustment.
- [Evidence 2]: The optimistic projections about technological progress and economic growth may be overly simplistic, but do not outweigh the stronger evidence pointing to increased risk.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 12.1%:
- Adjustment 1: +10% for the prediction of 27% vertebrate diversity loss by 2100
- Adjustment 2: +5% for the acknowledgment that human extinction cannot be ruled out
- Adjustment 3: +3% for the projected 10% species loss by 2050
- Adjustment 4: +2% for historical precedents of mass extinctions and civilizational collapses
- Cumulative adjustment: +20%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability of human extinction before 2100 were less than 10%, it would imply that the risks posed by climate change, environmental degradation, and other potential catastrophic events are significantly lower than the current evidence suggests. Conversely, if the probability were greater than 90%, it would mean that human extinction is virtually guaranteed, which seems unlikely given the complexity and uncertainty of the factors involved.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 20% adjustment from the base rate of 12.1% is justified by the strong evidence pointing to increased risk of human extinction, including the predicted loss of vertebrate diversity and the acknowledgment that such an outcome cannot be ruled out.

3. **Update magnitude:** The magnitude of the updates is proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence (27% vertebrate diversity loss) leading to the largest adjustment (10 percentage points).

4. **Regression to mean:** Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting such a rare and catastrophic event, it is important to account for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss. However, the cumulative evidence gathered here suggests a meaningful increase in the probability of human extinction by 2100, beyond what would be expected from a regression to the mean.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a historian, I believe the current evidence points to an increased risk of human extinction by 2100, relative to the initial base rate of 12.1%. The strong evidence of predicted biodiversity loss and the acknowledgment that such an outcome cannot be ruled out are particularly concerning, as they suggest that the complex systems upon which human civilization depends are under significant stress.

While there is always uncertainty in predicting such a rare and catastrophic event, the historical precedents of mass extinctions and civilizational collapses indicate that human societies are not immune to such existential threats. The moderate evidence of species loss and the potential for cascading effects on human populations further reinforces this concern.

At the same time, I remain cautious about overly speculative or optimistic projections, which may not fully capture the complexity and uncertainty of the challenges we face. The path forward will require a clear-eyed assessment of the risks, coupled with a concerted effort to address the underlying drivers of environmental degradation, technological risks, and other potential sources of catastrophic events.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Prediction of 27% vertebrate diversity loss by 2100, acknowledgment that human extinction cannot be ruled out
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 12.1%
- Total adjustment: +20%
- Final estimate: 32.1%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 32.1%**
