## Question
Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## Description
This question is asking about the probability of human extinction occurring before the year 2100.

## Resolution Criteria
The resolution criteria for this question would be whether or not humans have gone extinct by the year 2100. If humans are no longer in existence by the end of the 21st century, the question would be resolved as "yes". If humans are still present in 2100, the question would be resolved as "no".

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

Data sources for evaluating the historical precedent of human extinction are limited, as the modern human species (Homo sapiens) has only existed for around 300,000 years. The historical record of human extinction events is sparse and may be subject to systematic biases, as major extinction events could have occurred in the distant past without being recorded.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Mass Extinction Events**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 5 major mass extinction events in the last 500 million years, with the most recent being the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event around 66 million years ago.
- Sample size: 5 major extinction events
- Suitability score (1-10): 6
- Why this reference class: Mass extinction events provide a historical precedent for the potential extinction of dominant species, including humans. However, the timescales and causes of these events may not be directly applicable to the current situation.

**Reference Class 2: Primate Extinctions**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 10-20% of primate species have gone extinct in the last few centuries.
- Sample size: Hundreds of primate species
- Suitability score (1-10): 7
- Why this reference class: Primates, as the order that includes humans, provide a more relevant reference class for evaluating the potential for human extinction. The historical record of primate extinctions may offer insights into the vulnerability of human populations.

**Reference Class 3: Civilizational Collapses**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 10-20% of major civilizations have collapsed throughout history.
- Sample size: Hundreds of major civilizations
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: The collapse of human civilizations, while not necessarily resulting in complete extinction, provides a reference for the vulnerability of human societies to existential threats. This reference class may be more directly applicable to the current question.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation (if applicable)

Not applicable, as we have identified relevant reference classes.

### Step 4: Base Rate Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores:
1. Mass Extinction Events: 6/21 = 28.6%
2. Primate Extinctions: 7/21 = 33.3%
3. Civilizational Collapses: 8/21 = 38.1%

Integrated base rate = (0.286 × 5%) + (0.333 × 15%) + (0.381 × 15%) = 12.1%

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence level: 7/10

The available historical data provides a reasonable basis for estimating the base rate probability of human extinction, with multiple relevant reference classes. However, the limited sample sizes and potential for systematic biases in the data introduce some uncertainty.

**Base Rate Estimate:** 12.1%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. Mass Extinction Events: 5% base rate (weight: 28.6%)
2. Primate Extinctions: 15% base rate (weight: 33.3%)
3. Civilizational Collapses: 15% base rate (weight: 38.1%)

**Confidence Level:** 7/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The limited historical record of human extinction events may not fully capture the potential risks.
- The causes and timescales of past extinction events may not be directly applicable to the current situation.
- The potential for novel or unprecedented threats to human existence is not fully accounted for in the reference classes.

## Question
Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## Description
The task is to adjust a base rate of 12.1% for the probability of humans going extinct before 2100, based on current evidence.

## Resolution Criteria
The final probability estimate should be a number between 0.1% and 99.9%.

# Research Synthesis

**Generated:** 2026-01-24T09:04:39.955884+00:00
**Total Sources:** 27

## Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence gathered is relatively recent, with the majority of the sources being from the past 5 years. The sources appear to be from credible news outlets, academic institutions, and reputable online platforms. There is no obvious bias in the reporting, and the information does not seem to be already priced into the base rate.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: A study predicting that 27% of vertebrate diversity will vanish by 2100 due to climate change and other environmental factors. This suggests a significant risk of human extinction within the same timeframe.
- [Evidence 2]: Statements from experts, including a Stanford epidemiologist, that human extinction is a real possibility by 2100 if certain catastrophic events occur.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Estimates from experts that the median probability of human extinction by 2100 is around 6%, with a 20% chance of a catastrophic event before the end of the century.
- [Evidence 2]: Projections that a third of Earth's species could become extinct by 2100 if climate change continues unabated, which could have cascading effects on human survival.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Anecdotal discussions and speculation about the timeline of human extinction, ranging from the near future to millions of years from now.
- [Evidence 2]: A study predicting human extinction in 314 years, which seems highly speculative and not well-supported.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 10-15 percentage points, as the scale of projected biodiversity loss suggests a significant risk to human survival.
- [Evidence 2]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 5-10 percentage points, as expert assessments of the possibility of human extinction by 2100 are concerning.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 2-5 percentage points, as the median expert estimate of 6% probability provides a reasonable upper bound.
- [Evidence 2]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 2-5 percentage points, as the potential for a third of species to go extinct could have severe consequences for human survival.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: This does not significantly update the probability, as the anecdotal nature and lack of clear causal mechanisms make it difficult to quantify the impact.
- [Evidence 2]: This does not significantly update the probability, as the highly speculative nature of the study and lack of corroborating evidence make it difficult to rely on.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 12.1%:
- Adjustment 1: +12.5% for the strong evidence of significant biodiversity loss and expert assessments of human extinction risk by 2100.
- Adjustment 2: +4% for the moderate evidence of expert probability estimates and potential cascading effects of species extinctions.
- Adjustment 3: +0% for the weak evidence, which does not significantly update the probability.
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +16.5%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the final probability is very low (<10%), it would imply that the current evidence is being significantly underweighted, and that there are likely strong mitigating factors or reasons for human resilience that have not been accounted for. Conversely, if the final probability is very high (>90%), it would suggest that the evidence is being overly weighted and that the possibility of human survival by 2100 is being severely discounted.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 16.5% adjustment from the base rate of 12.1% seems justified given the strong and moderate evidence gathered, which points to a significant risk of human extinction by 2100.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates to the base rate are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strong evidence leading to a larger adjustment and the moderate evidence leading to a smaller but still meaningful adjustment.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability estimate of 28.6% does not represent an extreme prediction, and the tendency for such predictions to miss has been accounted for by not overly weighting the weak evidence and by anchoring the adjustment to the base rate.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have carefully reviewed the current evidence on the risk of human extinction before 2100. The strong evidence, including projections of significant biodiversity loss and expert assessments of the possibility of human extinction within this timeframe, suggests that the base rate of 12.1% should be adjusted upwards significantly.

The moderate evidence, such as expert probability estimates and the potential cascading effects of species extinctions, further reinforces the view that the risk of human extinction by 2100 is substantial. While the weak evidence, consisting of more speculative discussions and a highly questionable study, does not significantly update the probability, the cumulative weight of the strong and moderate evidence points to a meaningful increase in the risk of human extinction before the end of the century.

Considering all the evidence and reasoning through the various steps, I have adjusted the base rate of 12.1% upwards by 16.5 percentage points, resulting in a final probability estimate of 28.6%. This adjustment reflects the concerning trends and expert assessments regarding the potential for human extinction, while also accounting for the need to avoid overly extreme predictions and to remain anchored to the base rate.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Projections of significant biodiversity loss and expert assessments of human extinction risk by 2100
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 12.1%
- Total adjustment: +16.5%
- Final estimate: 28.6%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 28.6%**

**Total Sources:** 27

## Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence gathered covers a range of recent news, studies, and expert opinions on the likelihood of human extinction by 2100. The information appears to be relatively current, with many sources from the last few years. The sources seem credible, coming from reputable publications and scientific journals. There does not appear to be significant bias in the reporting, with a mix of perspectives and conclusions.

Some of the information, such as estimates of species loss and civilizational collapse, may already be partially reflected in the base rate of 12.1%. However, the specific focus on human extinction by 2100 provides additional relevant evidence.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: A study published in 2023 predicts that 27% of vertebrate diversity will vanish by 2100 due to climate change and other environmental factors, suggesting a significant risk to human survival.
- [Evidence 2]: Multiple sources, including scientific articles and expert interviews, indicate that human extinction cannot be ruled out as a possibility, given the potential for catastrophic events such as pandemics, nuclear war, or environmental collapse.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Estimates that 10% of all plant and animal species will disappear by 2050, which could have cascading effects on human populations and the ecosystems we depend on.
- [Evidence 2]: Historical precedents of mass extinction events and civilizational collapses, which suggest that human societies are not immune to such catastrophic outcomes.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Speculation and anecdotal reports about the potential timeline of human extinction, ranging from 314 years to 1 million years in the future.
- [Evidence 2]: Optimistic projections about technological progress and economic growth mitigating the risks of human extinction, which may not fully account for the complexity and uncertainty of future challenges.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence Pushing UP**
- [Evidence 1]: The prediction of 27% vertebrate diversity loss by 2100 is a strong indicator of the potential for significant disruption to human systems, pushing the probability up by approximately 10 percentage points.
- [Evidence 2]: The acknowledgment that human extinction cannot be ruled out, given the risk of catastrophic events, pushes the probability up by around 5 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence Pushing UP**
- [Evidence 1]: The projected 10% species loss by 2050 suggests a concerning trend, pushing the probability up by approximately 3 percentage points.
- [Evidence 2]: Historical precedents of mass extinctions and civilizational collapses indicate that human societies are vulnerable to such events, pushing the probability up by around 2 percentage points.

**WEAK Evidence (No Significant Update)**
- [Evidence 1]: The speculative timelines for human extinction do not provide enough concrete evidence to warrant a significant adjustment.
- [Evidence 2]: The optimistic projections about technological progress and economic growth may be overly simplistic, but do not outweigh the stronger evidence pointing to increased risk.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 12.1%:
- Adjustment 1: +10% for the prediction of 27% vertebrate diversity loss by 2100
- Adjustment 2: +5% for the acknowledgment that human extinction cannot be ruled out
- Adjustment 3: +3% for the projected 10% species loss by 2050
- Adjustment 4: +2% for historical precedents of mass extinctions and civilizational collapses
- Cumulative adjustment: +20%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability of human extinction before 2100 were less than 10%, it would imply that the risks posed by climate change, environmental degradation, and other potential catastrophic events are significantly lower than the current evidence suggests. Conversely, if the probability were greater than 90%, it would mean that human extinction is virtually guaranteed, which seems unlikely given the complexity and uncertainty of the factors involved.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 20% adjustment from the base rate of 12.1% is justified by the strong evidence pointing to increased risk of human extinction, including the predicted loss of vertebrate diversity and the acknowledgment that such an outcome cannot be ruled out.

3. **Update magnitude:** The magnitude of the updates is proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence (27% vertebrate diversity loss) leading to the largest adjustment (10 percentage points).

4. **Regression to mean:** Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting such a rare and catastrophic event, it is important to account for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss. However, the cumulative evidence gathered here suggests a meaningful increase in the probability of human extinction by 2100, beyond what would be expected from a regression to the mean.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a historian, I believe the current evidence points to an increased risk of human extinction by 2100, relative to the initial base rate of 12.1%. The strong evidence of predicted biodiversity loss and the acknowledgment that such an outcome cannot be ruled out are particularly concerning, as they suggest that the complex systems upon which human civilization depends are under significant stress.

While there is always uncertainty in predicting such a rare and catastrophic event, the historical precedents of mass extinctions and civilizational collapses indicate that human societies are not immune to such existential threats. The moderate evidence of species loss and the potential for cascading effects on human populations further reinforces this concern.

At the same time, I remain cautious about overly speculative or optimistic projections, which may not fully capture the complexity and uncertainty of the challenges we face. The path forward will require a clear-eyed assessment of the risks, coupled with a concerted effort to address the underlying drivers of environmental degradation, technological risks, and other potential sources of catastrophic events.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Prediction of 27% vertebrate diversity loss by 2100, acknowledgment that human extinction cannot be ruled out
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 12.1%
- Total adjustment: +20%

**Total Sources:** 27

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence presented covers a range of recent sources, from news articles to scientific studies. The sources seem credible, including reputable publications like Scientific American and Vox. However, there is a potential bias towards more sensational or alarming narratives, which could push the estimates of extinction risk upwards.

The most recent information is from 2023, so the evidence is fairly current, but does not fully capture the latest developments and trends. Some of the information may already be priced into the base rate.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: A supercomputer study predicting 27% of vertebrate diversity will vanish by 2100. This provides a clear, data-driven projection of significant biodiversity loss, which could indirectly threaten human survival.
- [Evidence 2]: Estimates from experts that put a 6% median probability of human extinction by 2100, and a 20% probability of a catastrophic event. This provides a direct assessment of extinction risk from knowledgeable sources.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Projections that a third of Earth's species could become extinct by 2100 due to climate change. This suggests a concerning trend, but the specific link to human extinction is less direct.
- [Evidence 2]: Discussions around the inevitability of human extinction at some point, even if the timing is uncertain. This provides context, but does not directly address the 2100 timeframe.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Anecdotal speculation about when humanity might go extinct, without clear supporting evidence.
- [Evidence 2]: Optimistic scenarios suggesting human population and living standards could continue to improve, potentially reducing extinction risk. This is speculative and does not directly address the 2100 timeframe.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence pointing UP:**
- The supercomputer study predicting 27% of vertebrate diversity loss by 2100 suggests a significant threat to the broader ecosystem, which could indirectly increase the risk of human extinction. This pushes the probability UP by approximately 5 percentage points.
- The expert estimates of a 6% median probability of human extinction by 2100, and a 20% probability of a catastrophic event, provide a direct assessment of extinction risk that pushes the probability UP by approximately 8 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence pointing DOWN:**
- The projections of a third of Earth's species becoming extinct by 2100 due to climate change, while concerning, do not directly translate to human extinction. This evidence is already somewhat captured in the base rate, so the update is neutral.
- The discussions around the inevitability of human extinction at some point, even if the timing is uncertain, do not provide specific information about the 2100 timeframe. This evidence is also already captured in the base rate, so the update is neutral.

**WEAK Evidence:** 
The anecdotal speculation and optimistic scenarios do not provide strong enough evidence to warrant an adjustment to the probability.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 12.1%:
- Adjustment 1: +5% for the supercomputer study predicting significant biodiversity loss
- Adjustment 2: +8% for the expert estimates of extinction and catastrophic event probabilities
- Cumulative adjustment: +13%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to be below 10%, it would imply that the current evidence is significantly overstating the extinction risk, and that there are strong mitigating factors or reasons for optimism that have not been captured. Conversely, if the probability were above 90%, it would suggest that the evidence is heavily biased towards the most catastrophic scenarios, and that the base rate and other moderating factors have been largely ignored.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 12.1% is based on a broad set of reference classes, including mass extinction events, primate extinctions, and civilizational collapses. While a 13 percentage point increase from the base rate is significant, it can be justified by the strong evidence pointing towards elevated extinction risk in the 2100 timeframe.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates made to the base rate are proportional to the strength of the evidence. The strong evidence pushing the probability up accounts for a 13 percentage point increase, which seems reasonable given the credibility and directness of the sources.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have considered the tendency for extreme predictions to miss, and have tried to balance the strong evidence pointing towards elevated extinction risk with the need to avoid overly alarmist forecasts.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. In this case, the base rate of 12.1% for human extinction before 2100 seems to be on the low side, given the current evidence.

The strong evidence from the supercomputer study and expert assessments suggests that the extinction risk may be significantly higher than the base rate indicates. The projected loss of biodiversity and the direct estimates of extinction and catastrophic event probabilities are concerning and point to a more serious threat than the consensus view.

At the same time, I acknowledge that there may be some bias towards more sensational or alarming narratives in the evidence presented. The moderate evidence, while not directly pushing the probability down, suggests that the link between broader environmental changes and human extinction is not as straightforward as the strong evidence may imply.

Ultimately, I believe the balance of the evidence points to a higher probability of human extinction before 2100 than the base rate suggests. While I don't want to be overly alarmist, the strong evidence from credible sources is difficult to ignore. I would adjust the probability upwards by 13 percentage points, resulting in a final estimate of 25.1%.

**Evidence Summary:**
