# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence gathered covers a range of recent developments and research on the risk of human extinction, with a focus on historical extinction rates, current threats, and expert analysis. The sources appear to be credible, coming from reputable scientific journals, news outlets, and academic institutions. The information is relatively recent, with the majority of the sources published within the past 5 years.

Some potential biases to consider:
- The media may tend to focus on sensationalized or alarming narratives around extinction risks.
- Researchers may have incentives to highlight existential threats to secure funding or attention.
- There could be publication bias, where negative or pessimistic findings are more likely to be reported.

However, the consistent themes across multiple independent sources suggest the information is not entirely priced into the base rate.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- Extinctions during the human era are occurring at a rate much higher than the "normal background rate" of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year. This suggests a significant human impact on biodiversity.
- Mathematical models predict a sixth mass extinction event by 2100 if current trends continue, with the potential to trigger a catastrophic loss of species.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- Estimates that up to a third of all species alive today could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change impacts.
- Evidence that human ancestors may have experienced a near-extinction event around 930,000 years ago, suggesting the human species is fragile.
- Polling data showing that a significant portion of the public believes climate change could lead to human extinction.

**WEAK Evidence**
- Anecdotal reports of cities being lost to rising sea levels, which could contribute to human extinction.
- Speculation about other potential triggers for human extinction, such as technological risks or other catastrophic events.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence (UP):**
- The evidence on historical extinction rates and mathematical models predicting a sixth mass extinction event suggests the probability of human extinction before 2100 is higher than the base rate. This pushes the probability UP by approximately 10-15 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence (UP):**
- The estimates of significant species loss due to climate change, as well as the near-extinction event in human history, indicate the fragility of the human species and push the probability UP by approximately 5-10 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence (DOWN):**
- The public polling data suggesting climate change-driven human extinction is seen as a possibility, but not a certainty, does not significantly change the base rate and is already largely captured.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 15.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +12.5% for strong evidence on historical extinction rates and mathematical models
- Adjustment 2: +7.5% for moderate evidence on climate change impacts and human fragility
- Cumulative adjustment: +20.0%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the final probability is above 90%, it would imply near-certainty of human extinction, which seems unlikely given the complexity of the issue and the potential for technological or societal adaptations. Conversely, a final probability below 10% would suggest a very low risk, which may not be justified by the evidence.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 20% adjustment from the base rate seems justified given the strength and consistency of the evidence, which points to a significantly higher risk of extinction than the initial 15% estimate.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with stronger evidence leading to larger adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability of 35% does not seem to be an extreme outlier, and the adjustment is not so large as to require significant regression to the mean.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have carefully reviewed the current evidence on the risk of human extinction before 2100. The key factors I have considered are:

1. Historical extinction rates: The evidence shows that the current rate of extinctions during the human era is much higher than the "normal background rate," suggesting a significant human impact on biodiversity. This is a strong indicator that the risk of human extinction may be higher than the base rate.

2. Mathematical modeling: Several studies have used mathematical models to predict a sixth mass extinction event by 2100 if current trends continue. This provides further strong evidence that the probability of human extinction is higher than the initial 15% estimate.

3. Climate change impacts: Moderate evidence suggests that up to a third of all species could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change. This fragility of the natural world is a concerning indicator for the long-term survival of the human species.

4. Human species fragility: The evidence that human ancestors may have experienced a near-extinction event in the past also suggests the human species is more vulnerable than previously thought.

Weighing all of this evidence, I believe the probability of human extinction before 2100 is higher than the 15% base rate. The strong evidence on historical extinction rates and mathematical models pushes the probability up by approximately 10-15 percentage points, while the moderate evidence on climate change impacts and human fragility adds another 5-10 percentage points.

Therefore, my final estimate is that the probability of humans going extinct before 2100 is 35%.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Historical extinction rates, mathematical models predicting mass extinction
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 15.0%
- Total adjustment: +20.0%
- Final estimate: 35.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 35.0%**
