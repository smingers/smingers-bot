# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what might make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question
Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## Resolution Criteria
The question asks whether humans will go extinct before the year 2100.

**Total Sources:** 27

## Source Analysis
The evidence provided covers a range of recent research on human extinction risks, from historical extinction rates to expert analyses on the probability of human extinction. The sources seem credible, coming from reputable scientific publications and news outlets. There is a good mix of quantitative data and qualitative analysis.

The most recent information is from 2026, so the evidence is reasonably up-to-date. However, there are no sources that directly address the 2100 timeframe, so some extrapolation will be required.

There do not appear to be any major biases in the reporting, and the information seems to go beyond the base rate, providing additional context and analysis.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Extinctions during human era worse than thought] - This source provides a historical "normal background rate" of extinction of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year, which could be used to estimate the risk of human extinction.
- [An upper bound for the background rate of human extinction] - This study calculates an upper bound for the human extinction rate, which is useful for assessing the plausibility of extinction by 2100.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [There have been five mass extinctions in Earth's history] - This provides context on the scale and frequency of mass extinction events, which could inform the likelihood of human extinction.
- [Extinction of the human species: What could cause it and how likely] - This source discusses potential causes and likelihood of human extinction, though without quantitative estimates.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Humans driving extinctions on scale not seen since dinosaurs] - This source discusses the human impact on extinctions, but does not directly address the probability of human extinction itself.
- [Poll: Most Americans Believe Cities Will Be Lost to Rising Sea Levels] - This poll is not directly relevant to the probability of human extinction, though it suggests public concerns about existential risks.

## Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence Pushing UP:**
- [Extinctions during human era worse than thought]: The "normal background rate" of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year suggests a relatively high baseline risk of human extinction. This pushes the probability up by approximately 5 percentage points.
- [An upper bound for the background rate of human extinction]: The calculated upper bound of 6.9 x 10^-5 extinctions per year (or 0.0069% per year) also implies a non-negligible risk of human extinction by 2100. This pushes the probability up by approximately 3 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence Pushing UP:**
- [There have been five mass extinctions in Earth's history]: The historical precedent of mass extinctions suggests the possibility of a similar event occurring, pushing the probability up by approximately 2 percentage points.
- [Extinction of the human species: What could cause it and how likely]: The qualitative discussion of potential causes and likelihood of human extinction, while not quantitative, lends some support to the possibility, pushing the probability up by approximately 1 percentage point.

**WEAK Evidence Pushing UP:**
- [Humans driving extinctions on scale not seen since dinosaurs]: This source suggests that human activity is causing unprecedented levels of extinction, which could increase the risk of human extinction, though the connection is indirect. This pushes the probability up by approximately 1 percentage point.
- [Poll: Most Americans Believe Cities Will Be Lost to Rising Sea Levels]: While not directly relevant, this poll indicates public concern about existential risks, which could be seen as a weak signal pushing the probability up by approximately 0.5 percentage points.

## Integration

Starting from 15.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +5% for the "normal background rate" of extinctions
- Adjustment 2: +3% for the upper bound on human extinction rate
- Adjustment 3: +2% for the historical precedent of mass extinctions
- Adjustment 4: +1% for the qualitative discussion of human extinction likelihood
- Adjustment 5: +1% for the unprecedented levels of human-driven extinctions
- Adjustment 6: +0.5% for the public concern about existential risks
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +12.5%

## Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is significantly higher than 27.5% (15% + 12.5%), it would require an extremely pessimistic view of humanity's ability to avoid extinction, such as a high probability of an existential catastrophe like a global pandemic, nuclear war, or uncontrolled technological development. Conversely, if my prediction is significantly lower than 27.5%, it would require a very optimistic view of humanity's resilience and ability to mitigate extinction risks.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 12.5% adjustment from the base rate is substantial but not unreasonable given the strong and moderate evidence pointing to an increased risk of human extinction. The base rate itself is also relatively low, so a larger adjustment is justified.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence pushing the probability up the most, and the weaker evidence having a smaller impact.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have considered the tendency of extreme predictions to miss, and have not made an overly dramatic adjustment that would be unlikely to be accurate.

## Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. In this case, the base rate of 15% for human extinction before 2100 seems relatively low, given the strong historical precedent of mass extinctions and the concerning trends of human-driven extinctions.

The key pieces of evidence that push me to revise the probability upward are the "normal background rate" of extinctions and the calculated upper bound on the human extinction rate. These provide quantitative estimates that suggest the risk of human extinction is non-negligible, even if the probability is still relatively low.

Additionally, the historical context of mass extinctions and the qualitative discussion of potential causes of human extinction lend further support to the idea that the base rate may be underestimating the true risk.

While there are also some weaker signals, such as public concern about existential risks, these serve to reinforce the overall assessment that the probability of human extinction before 2100 is likely higher than the initial 15% base rate.

Ultimately, as a contrarian forecaster, I believe the evidence points to a higher probability of human extinction than the consensus view, and I would adjust the estimate upward to 27.5%.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Historical extinction rates, upper bound on human extinction rate
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 15.0%
- Total adjustment: +12.5%
- Final estimate: 27.5%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 27.5%**
