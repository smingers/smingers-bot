## Question
Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## Description
The question is about the probability of human extinction before the year 2100.

## Resolution Criteria
The question is asking for a probability estimate of human extinction before the year 2100.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

Data sources for this type of question are limited, as human extinction is a rare and unprecedented event. The historical record on human extinction is sparse and may be subject to biases, as information on past extinctions could be incomplete or unreliable.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Mass Extinctions in Earth's History**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 5 major mass extinctions in the last 500 million years, with the most recent being the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event around 66 million years ago.
- Sample size: 5 major mass extinction events.
- Suitability score (1-10): 6. While mass extinctions provide a relevant reference class, the timescales and causes involved are vastly different from the current situation.
- Why this reference class: Mass extinctions provide a historical precedent for the possibility of a global catastrophic event leading to the extinction of a significant portion of life on Earth.

**Reference Class 2: Existential Risks to Humanity**
- Historical base rate: There have been no known cases of human extinction in recorded history.
- Sample size: 0 events of human extinction.
- Suitability score (1-10): 8. This reference class is more directly relevant to the question, as it focuses on risks that could lead to the extinction of the human species.
- Why this reference class: Existential risks, such as global pandemics, nuclear war, or environmental catastrophes, are the most relevant reference class for assessing the probability of human extinction.

**Reference Class 3: Technological Singularity and Transhumanism**
- Historical base rate: The concept of a technological singularity, where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, is a hypothetical future event with no historical precedent.
- Sample size: 0 events of a technological singularity.
- Suitability score (1-10): 7. While the potential impact of a technological singularity on human extinction is significant, the likelihood and timing of such an event are highly uncertain.
- Why this reference class: The possibility of a technological singularity, where AI systems become superintelligent and potentially transform or replace humanity, is a relevant consideration for the probability of human extinction.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation (if applicable)

Not applicable, as we have some relevant reference classes to consider.

### Step 4: Base Rate Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability:
1. Existential Risks to Humanity: 50% weight
2. Mass Extinctions in Earth's History: 30% weight
3. Technological Singularity and Transhumanism: 20% weight

Integrated base rate:
(0% × 0.5) + (5% × 0.3) + (50% × 0.2) = 15%

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence level: 6/10

The historical record on human extinction is very limited, and the potential causes and mechanisms involved are highly uncertain. While the reference classes provide some guidance, the overall confidence in this base rate estimate is moderate due to the lack of direct historical precedents.

**Base Rate Estimate:** 15%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. Mass Extinctions in Earth's History: 5% base rate (weight: 30%)
2. Existential Risks to Humanity: 0% base rate (weight: 50%)
3. Technological Singularity and Transhumanism: 50% base rate (weight: 20%)

**Confidence Level:** 6/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The historical record on human extinction is very limited, making it difficult to establish a reliable base rate.
- The potential causes and mechanisms of human extinction, such as global catastrophic risks or technological developments, are highly uncertain and difficult to quantify.
- The timescale of 2100 is relatively short compared to the timescales involved in mass extinctions and technological singularity, adding further uncertainty.

**Total Sources:** 27

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence gathered covers a range of recent developments and research on the risk of human extinction, with a focus on historical extinction rates, current threats, and expert analysis. The sources appear to be credible, coming from reputable scientific journals, news outlets, and academic institutions. The information is relatively recent, with the majority of the sources published within the past 5 years.

Some potential biases to consider:
- The media may tend to focus on sensationalized or alarming narratives around extinction risks.
- Researchers may have incentives to highlight existential threats to secure funding or attention.
- There could be publication bias, where negative or pessimistic findings are more likely to be reported.

However, the consistent themes across multiple independent sources suggest the information is not entirely priced into the base rate.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- Extinctions during the human era are occurring at a rate much higher than the "normal background rate" of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year. This suggests a significant human impact on biodiversity.
- Mathematical models predict a sixth mass extinction event by 2100 if current trends continue, with the potential to trigger a catastrophic loss of species.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- Estimates that up to a third of all species alive today could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change impacts.
- Evidence that human ancestors may have experienced a near-extinction event around 930,000 years ago, suggesting the human species is fragile.
- Polling data showing that a significant portion of the public believes climate change could lead to human extinction.

**WEAK Evidence**
- Anecdotal reports of cities being lost to rising sea levels, which could contribute to human extinction.
- Speculation about other potential triggers for human extinction, such as technological risks or other catastrophic events.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence (UP):**
- The evidence on historical extinction rates and mathematical models predicting a sixth mass extinction event suggests the probability of human extinction before 2100 is higher than the base rate. This pushes the probability UP by approximately 10-15 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence (UP):**
- The estimates of significant species loss due to climate change, as well as the near-extinction event in human history, indicate the fragility of the human species and push the probability UP by approximately 5-10 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence (DOWN):**
- The public polling data suggesting climate change-driven human extinction is seen as a possibility, but not a certainty, does not significantly change the base rate and is already largely captured.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 15.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +12.5% for strong evidence on historical extinction rates and mathematical models
- Adjustment 2: +7.5% for moderate evidence on climate change impacts and human fragility
- Cumulative adjustment: +20.0%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the final probability is above 90%, it would imply near-certainty of human extinction, which seems unlikely given the complexity of the issue and the potential for technological or societal adaptations. Conversely, a final probability below 10% would suggest a very low risk, which may not be justified by the evidence.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 20% adjustment from the base rate seems justified given the strength and consistency of the evidence, which points to a significantly higher risk of extinction than the initial 15% estimate.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with stronger evidence leading to larger adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability of 35% does not seem to be an extreme outlier, and the adjustment is not so large as to require significant regression to the mean.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have carefully reviewed the current evidence on the risk of human extinction before 2100. The key factors I have considered are:

1. Historical extinction rates: The evidence shows that the current rate of extinctions during the human era is much higher than the "normal background rate," suggesting a significant human impact on biodiversity. This is a strong indicator that the risk of human extinction may be higher than the base rate.

2. Mathematical modeling: Several studies have used mathematical models to predict a sixth mass extinction event by 2100 if current trends continue. This provides further strong evidence that the probability of human extinction is higher than the initial 15% estimate.

3. Climate change impacts: Moderate evidence suggests that up to a third of all species could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change. This fragility of the natural world is a concerning indicator for the long-term survival of the human species.

4. Human species fragility: The evidence that human ancestors may have experienced a near-extinction event in the past also suggests the human species is more vulnerable than previously thought.

Weighing all of this evidence, I believe the probability of human extinction before 2100 is higher than the 15% base rate. The strong evidence on historical extinction rates and mathematical models pushes the probability up by approximately 10-15 percentage points, while the moderate evidence on climate change impacts and human fragility adds another 5-10 percentage points.

Therefore, my final estimate is that the probability of humans going extinct before 2100 is 35%.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Historical extinction rates, mathematical models predicting mass extinction
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 15.0%
- Total adjustment: +20.0%
- Final estimate: 35.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 35.0%**

**Evidence weighted:**
- Strong: Extinctions during the human era are occurring at a rate much higher than the "normal background rat, Mathematical models predict a sixth mass extinction event by 2100 if current trends continue, with t

## Your Task

Starting from the base rate of 15.0%, adjust based on current evidence. Show your full reasoning.

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence provided covers a range of recent and historical information on extinction rates and risks to human survival. The sources appear to be credible, including scientific journals, reputable news outlets, and expert analyses. There doesn't seem to be significant bias in the reporting, as the information covers both positive and negative trends.

The most relevant and up-to-date information appears to be from the last 5-10 years, with a few older sources providing historical context. Overall, the evidence seems to be well-suited to informing an assessment of the probability of human extinction by 2100.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence (pointing UP):**
- [Evidence 1]: Recent studies suggesting up to a third of all species could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change, indicating a significant risk of human extinction.
- [Evidence 2]: Mathematical models predicting a sixth mass extinction event by 2100 driven by climate change and carbon levels.

**MODERATE Evidence (pointing UP):**
- [Evidence 1]: Historical data showing that mass extinctions have occurred in the past, suggesting the possibility of a similar event in the future.
- [Evidence 2]: Estimates of the "normal background rate" of extinctions being much lower than the current rate, indicating an elevated risk.

**WEAK Evidence (pointing UP):**
- [Evidence 1]: Poll data showing that a significant portion of the public believes climate change could lead to human extinction, though public perception may not accurately reflect the true probability.
- [Evidence 2]: Anecdotal reports of human ancestors experiencing population crashes in the past, which could suggest vulnerability to extinction.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

**Strong Evidence Pointing UP:**
- [Evidence 1]: The studies predicting up to a third of species could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change suggest a significant risk of human extinction, as humans are highly dependent on the natural environment. This evidence pushes the probability up by approximately 10-15 percentage points.
- [Evidence 2]: The mathematical models predicting a sixth mass extinction event by 2100 due to climate change and carbon levels also indicate a substantial risk of human extinction. This evidence pushes the probability up by approximately 10-15 percentage points.

**Moderate Evidence Pointing UP:**
- [Evidence 1]: The historical data on past mass extinctions suggests that such events are possible in the future, which increases the risk of human extinction. This evidence pushes the probability up by approximately 5-10 percentage points.
- [Evidence 2]: The estimates of a much lower "normal background rate" of extinctions compared to the current rate suggest an elevated risk of human extinction. This evidence pushes the probability up by approximately 5-10 percentage points.

**Weak Evidence Pointing UP:**
- [Evidence 1]: The poll data on public perceptions of climate change-driven human extinction is not a strong indicator of the actual probability, but it does suggest that the risk is being taken seriously. This evidence has a minimal impact, pushing the probability up by perhaps 1-2 percentage points.
- [Evidence 2]: The anecdotal reports of past human population crashes are interesting historical context, but do not provide a strong basis for updating the probability. This evidence has a negligible impact on the probability estimate.

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from the base rate of 15.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +10-15% for the strong evidence of up to a third of species potentially going extinct by 2100 due to climate change.
- Adjustment 2: +10-15% for the strong evidence of mathematical models predicting a sixth mass extinction event by 2100.
- Adjustment 3: +5-10% for the moderate evidence of historical precedents of mass extinctions.
- Adjustment 4: +5-10% for the moderate evidence of a much lower "normal background rate" of extinctions compared to the current rate.
- Adjustment 5: +1-2% for the weak evidence of public perceptions of climate change-driven human extinction.

**Cumulative adjustment:** Approximately +30-52 percentage points.

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the final probability estimate is very high (e.g., >80%), it would mean that we are highly confident that human extinction by 2100 is a likely outcome. This would require strong, consistent evidence from multiple reliable sources, as well as a clear causal mechanism linking current trends to a catastrophic event.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 15.0% seems reasonable given the historical context, but the cumulative adjustments of 30-52 percentage points represent a significant deviation. This is justified by the strong and consistent evidence pointing to an elevated risk of human extinction due to climate change and other factors.

3. **Update magnitude:** The magnitude of the updates seems proportional to the strength of the evidence. The strong evidence has the largest impact, while the weaker evidence has a more modest influence.

4. **Regression to mean:** Given the high-stakes nature of this question, it is appropriate to place more weight on the current evidence rather than heavily regressing towards the mean. However, it is still important to consider the potential for overconfidence and the possibility of missing important factors.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a historian, I am deeply concerned by the evidence presented on the potential for human extinction by 2100. The strong evidence from recent studies and mathematical models predicting a third of all species could go extinct, as well as the possibility of a sixth mass extinction event driven by climate change and carbon levels, suggests a significant and growing risk.

While mass extinctions have occurred in the past, the current rate of species loss is far outpacing the "normal background rate," indicating that human activities are playing a major role in disrupting the natural balance. The historical precedents of past population crashes among human ancestors also raise concerns about our species' vulnerability.

Ultimately, the cumulative evidence points to a substantial increase in the probability of human extinction by 2100, well above the initial base rate of 15%. The combination of climate change, environmental degradation, and other potential existential risks appears to be creating a perfect storm of threats to our long-term survival as a species.

As a historian, I believe it is crucial to learn from the past and use that knowledge to inform our understanding of the present and future. The patterns of mass extinctions and the fragility of complex ecosystems should serve as a stark warning about the risks we now face. While there is still time to take action and mitigate these threats, the window of opportunity is closing rapidly.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Studies predicting up to a third of species could go extinct by 2100 due to climate change, mathematical models predicting a sixth mass extinction event by 2100.
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None.
- Net direction: UP.

## Source Analysis
The evidence provided covers a range of recent research on human extinction risks, from historical extinction rates to expert analyses on the probability of human extinction. The sources seem credible, coming from reputable scientific publications and news outlets. There is a good mix of quantitative data and qualitative analysis.

The most recent information is from 2026, so the evidence is reasonably up-to-date. However, there are no sources that directly address the 2100 timeframe, so some extrapolation will be required.

There do not appear to be any major biases in the reporting, and the information seems to go beyond the base rate, providing additional context and analysis.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Extinctions during human era worse than thought] - This source provides a historical "normal background rate" of extinction of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year, which could be used to estimate the risk of human extinction.
- [An upper bound for the background rate of human extinction] - This study calculates an upper bound for the human extinction rate, which is useful for assessing the plausibility of extinction by 2100.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [There have been five mass extinctions in Earth's history] - This provides context on the scale and frequency of mass extinction events, which could inform the likelihood of human extinction.
- [Extinction of the human species: What could cause it and how likely] - This source discusses potential causes and likelihood of human extinction, though without quantitative estimates.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Humans driving extinctions on scale not seen since dinosaurs] - This source discusses the human impact on extinctions, but does not directly address the probability of human extinction itself.
- [Poll: Most Americans Believe Cities Will Be Lost to Rising Sea Levels] - This poll is not directly relevant to the probability of human extinction, though it suggests public concerns about existential risks.

## Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence Pushing UP:**
- [Extinctions during human era worse than thought]: The "normal background rate" of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year suggests a relatively high baseline risk of human extinction. This pushes the probability up by approximately 5 percentage points.
- [An upper bound for the background rate of human extinction]: The calculated upper bound of 6.9 x 10^-5 extinctions per year (or 0.0069% per year) also implies a non-negligible risk of human extinction by 2100. This pushes the probability up by approximately 3 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence Pushing UP:**
- [There have been five mass extinctions in Earth's history]: The historical precedent of mass extinctions suggests the possibility of a similar event occurring, pushing the probability up by approximately 2 percentage points.
- [Extinction of the human species: What could cause it and how likely]: The qualitative discussion of potential causes and likelihood of human extinction, while not quantitative, lends some support to the possibility, pushing the probability up by approximately 1 percentage point.

**WEAK Evidence Pushing UP:**
- [Humans driving extinctions on scale not seen since dinosaurs]: This source suggests that human activity is causing unprecedented levels of extinction, which could increase the risk of human extinction, though the connection is indirect. This pushes the probability up by approximately 1 percentage point.
- [Poll: Most Americans Believe Cities Will Be Lost to Rising Sea Levels]: While not directly relevant, this poll indicates public concern about existential risks, which could be seen as a weak signal pushing the probability up by approximately 0.5 percentage points.

## Integration

Starting from 15.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +5% for the "normal background rate" of extinctions
- Adjustment 2: +3% for the upper bound on human extinction rate
- Adjustment 3: +2% for the historical precedent of mass extinctions
- Adjustment 4: +1% for the qualitative discussion of human extinction likelihood
- Adjustment 5: +1% for the unprecedented levels of human-driven extinctions
- Adjustment 6: +0.5% for the public concern about existential risks
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +12.5%

## Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is significantly higher than 27.5% (15% + 12.5%), it would require an extremely pessimistic view of humanity's ability to avoid extinction, such as a high probability of an existential catastrophe like a global pandemic, nuclear war, or uncontrolled technological development. Conversely, if my prediction is significantly lower than 27.5%, it would require a very optimistic view of humanity's resilience and ability to mitigate extinction risks.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 12.5% adjustment from the base rate is substantial but not unreasonable given the strong and moderate evidence pointing to an increased risk of human extinction. The base rate itself is also relatively low, so a larger adjustment is justified.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence pushing the probability up the most, and the weaker evidence having a smaller impact.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have considered the tendency of extreme predictions to miss, and have not made an overly dramatic adjustment that would be unlikely to be accurate.

## Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. In this case, the base rate of 15% for human extinction before 2100 seems relatively low, given the strong historical precedent of mass extinctions and the concerning trends of human-driven extinctions.

The key pieces of evidence that push me to revise the probability upward are the "normal background rate" of extinctions and the calculated upper bound on the human extinction rate. These provide quantitative estimates that suggest the risk of human extinction is non-negligible, even if the probability is still relatively low.

Additionally, the historical context of mass extinctions and the qualitative discussion of potential causes of human extinction lend further support to the idea that the base rate may be underestimating the true risk.

While there are also some weaker signals, such as public concern about existential risks, these serve to reinforce the overall assessment that the probability of human extinction before 2100 is likely higher than the initial 15% base rate.

Ultimately, as a contrarian forecaster, I believe the evidence points to a higher probability of human extinction than the consensus view, and I would adjust the estimate upward to 27.5%.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Historical extinction rates, upper bound on human extinction rate
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
