# Base Rate Analysis: Human Extinction Before 2100

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The historical data for human extinction events is fundamentally limited because:
- **Sample size of 1**: Homo sapiens has never gone extinct (by definition, since we're here)
- **Observational bias**: We can only observe timelines where humanity survived to the present
- **Limited timeframe**: Modern civilization spans only ~10,000 years; industrial civilization ~250 years
- **Data quality**: Archaeological records become sparse going back in time
- **Definitional challenges**: What constitutes "human extinction" vs. evolutionary transition is debated

Available data sources include:
- Paleontological records of species extinctions
- Archaeological evidence of civilization collapses
- Historical records of population bottlenecks
- Geological records of mass extinction events

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Large Mammalian Species Extinctions**
- Historical base rate: ~1-2% per century for large mammals in recent millennia
- Sample size: Thousands of large mammal species over geological time
- Suitability score: 3/10
- Why this reference class: Humans are large mammals, but our technology, global distribution, and adaptability make us fundamentally different from other species. This severely limits applicability.

**Reference Class 2: Hominin Species Extinctions**
- Historical base rate: ~100% eventually (all previous hominin species extinct)
- Sample size: ~20-30 hominin species over 7 million years
- Suitability score: 4/10
- Why this reference class: More relevant as close evolutionary relatives, but previous hominins lacked modern technology, global civilization, and population sizes. Timeline also much longer than our 76-year window.

**Reference Class 3: Civilization Collapse Events**
- Historical base rate: ~5-10% of major civilizations experience total collapse per century
- Sample size: ~20-30 major historical civilizations
- Suitability score: 2/10
- Why this reference class: Civilization collapse ≠ species extinction. Even major collapses (Roman Empire, Maya, etc.) didn't eliminate the underlying populations, just political/social structures.

**Reference Class 4: Mass Extinction Events**
- Historical base rate: ~1 per 10-20 million years (so ~0.000001% per century)
- Sample size: 5 major mass extinctions in 540 million years
- Suitability score: 5/10
- Why this reference class: These events eliminated large percentages of species, but the timescales are vastly different and causes were typically gradual geological processes or rare cosmic events.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation

Given poor reference classes, decomposing by extinction mechanisms:

P(extinction by 2100) = P(natural disaster) + P(human-caused) - P(overlap)

**Natural disasters:**
- P(asteroid/comet impact) ≈ 0.01% (based on impact frequency)
- P(supervolcanic eruption) ≈ 0.1% (Yellowstone-scale events)
- P(gamma ray burst) ≈ 0.001% (very rare, uncertain lethality)
- Natural subtotal ≈ 0.11%

**Human-caused (harder to estimate from base rates alone):**
- Historical precedent extremely limited for global-scale human-caused extinction
- No reference class exists for technological civilization destroying itself completely
- Estimate: Highly uncertain, 0.1-10% range based on civilization fragility

**Combined rough estimate: 0.2-10%**

## Step 4: Base Rate Integration

Weighting by suitability scores:
- Mass extinction events (weight 5): ~0.000001%
- Hominin extinctions (weight 4): Not applicable to 76-year timeframe
- Large mammals (weight 3): ~1-2%
- Civilization collapse (weight 2): Not equivalent to extinction

The mass extinction reference class suggests extremely low probability, but may miss human-specific risks. The mammalian extinction rate is likely too high given human advantages. Fermi estimation suggests 0.2-10% range.

**Integrated estimate: ~1%**

## Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence: **2/10** - Very uncertain

The fundamental problem is lack of relevant historical precedent for:
- Technological species extinction
- Global civilization collapse leading to species extinction
- Human-level intelligence going extinct in short timeframes

## Output Format

**Base Rate Estimate:** 1%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. Mass extinction events: ~0.000001% base rate (weight: 5)
2. Hominin species extinctions: Not applicable to timeframe (weight: 4)  
3. Large mammalian extinctions: ~1-2% per century (weight: 3)
4. Civilization collapses: ~5-10% per century but ≠ extinction (weight: 2)

**Confidence Level:** 2/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- No historical precedent for technological civilization extinction
- Survivorship bias in observable timelines
- Unclear definition boundaries between extinction vs. transformation
- Limited sample size for relevant reference classes
- Difficulty separating natural vs. anthropogenic risks using historical data alone
