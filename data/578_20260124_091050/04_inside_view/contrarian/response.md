## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence is quite recent (2023-2025), with credible academic sources (Nature, Science, Stanford) mixed with media reporting. However, there's a clear bias toward sensationalism in extinction reporting - media loves apocalyptic narratives. Most concerning: the base rate may be artificially LOW because it relies on historical reference classes that don't account for humanity's unprecedented technological capabilities and global interconnectedness.

**Key bias**: The base rate assumes humans are "just another large mammal" - but we're the first species to potentially engineer our own extinction through technology.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- Nature paper establishing background extinction rates: Provides scientific baseline but for natural extinction, not technological self-destruction
- Current biodiversity crisis data: Shows we're already in a mass extinction event, but this doesn't directly threaten human survival

**MODERATE Evidence**  
- AI extinction risk assessments (5% by 2100 from expert surveys): These are expert opinions but highly speculative about unprecedented technology
- Climate change impacts: Serious civilizational threat but unlikely to cause complete extinction given human adaptability

**WEAK Evidence**
- Single researcher claiming 99.9% AI extinction risk: Extreme outlier opinion, not peer-reviewed consensus
- Media reports on AI autonomy by 2027: Speculative timeline predictions with poor track record

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**Evidence update reasoning:**
- AI risk expert surveys: UP by approximately 3-4 percentage points because this represents new extinction pathways not captured in historical base rates
- Accelerating technological development: UP by approximately 1-2 percentage points because rate of change creates novel risks
- Current biodiversity crisis: DOWN by approximately 0.5 percentage points because it shows ecosystem resilience and human adaptability
- Historical human survival record: DOWN by approximately 1 percentage point because we've survived ice ages, plagues, wars, and natural disasters

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 1.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +3.5% for AI and novel technological risks not in historical base rate
- Adjustment 2: +1.5% for unprecedented rate of technological/environmental change  
- Adjustment 3: -1.0% for demonstrated human resilience and adaptability
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +4.0%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** At 5%, for me to be wrong, either technological risks would need to be manageable (possible - we've regulated other dangerous tech) or humans would need to be more fragile than our track record suggests.

2. **Base rate anchor:** 4x increase from base rate is justified because the base rate doesn't account for self-inflicted technological extinction - a completely new category of risk.

3. **Update magnitude:** Updates are proportional - largest adjustment for strongest novel evidence (AI risk).

4. **Regression to mean:** 5% is still quite low, accounting for uncertainty in extreme predictions.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian, I'm challenging two narratives:

**Against the optimists:** The 1% base rate is dangerously low because it's based on "natural" extinction patterns. Humans are unprecedented - we're the first species that could accidentally extinct ourselves through technology. The AI risk surveys showing 5-10% aren't fringe opinions; they're from the experts building these systems. We're also living through the fastest rate of change in human history across multiple domains simultaneously.

**Against the doomsayers:** However, the extreme predictions (99.9% extinction) are likely wrong. Humans have survived existential threats before through adaptation and cooperation. We've already shown we can regulate dangerous technologies (nuclear weapons, bioweapons treaties). The current biodiversity crisis, while serious, actually demonstrates ecosystem and human resilience rather than fragility.

**The key insight everyone's missing:** The base rate methodology itself is flawed for this question. Historical reference classes can't capture the novel risk profile of a technologically advanced, globally connected civilization. But neither can speculative forecasting about unprecedented technologies.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Expert AI risk assessments, unprecedented technological development pace
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Historical human survival record, demonstrated technological governance capability  
- Net direction: UP (novel risks outweigh historical resilience)

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 1.0%
- Total adjustment: +4.0%
- Final estimate: 5.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 6/10

**Probability: 5.0%**
