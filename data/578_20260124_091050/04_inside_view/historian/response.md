## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence spans from 2019-2025, with most sources being recent (2023-2025). Sources include reputable academic journals (Nature, Science), established institutions (Stanford, MIT, RAND), and international organizations. However, there's a notable bias toward AI extinction risks in recent coverage, which may reflect current media attention rather than historical patterns. Most historical extinction data appears well-established and likely already incorporated into base rates, while AI risk assessments represent newer concerns.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- Historical mass extinction patterns: Five major extinction events in Earth's history, with natural background rates of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year. This provides solid baseline data.
- Human-driven acceleration: Current extinction rates are "unprecedented in human history and highly unusual in Earth's history" with documented acceleration since 1500 AD.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- Expert survey data: 2008 Future of Humanity Institute survey estimated 5% probability of AI extinction by 2100; 2016 AI expert surveys showing concern about extinction risks.
- Quantified background rates: Nature study providing upper bounds for human extinction background rates (6.9 × 10⁻⁵).

**WEAK Evidence**
- Individual AI researcher predictions of 99.9% extinction risk - appears to be outlier opinion without peer review.
- General biodiversity crisis data - relevant but doesn't directly address human extinction specifically.
- Climate change concerns - mentioned but without specific extinction probability estimates.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**Historical Analysis:**
- Past mass extinctions (UP ~0.1%): While five major extinction events occurred, none eliminated all large mammals simultaneously. However, current human impact exceeds historical precedents.
- Human resilience patterns (DOWN ~0.2%): Humans survived the Toba supervolcanic eruption (~74,000 years ago), ice ages, plagues, and wars. Geographic distribution and technological adaptation show remarkable resilience.
- Technological risks emergence (UP ~0.3%): Unlike historical periods, we now face novel extinction risks (nuclear weapons, AI, engineered pandemics) without historical precedent for mitigation.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 1.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +0.1% for current extinction rate acceleration beyond historical norms
- Adjustment 2: -0.2% for demonstrated human resilience across historical catastrophes  
- Adjustment 3: +0.3% for unprecedented technological risks without historical mitigation precedents
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +0.2%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** At 1.2%, I would be wrong if either: (a) technological risks prove far more dangerous than historical precedents suggest, or (b) human adaptability continues to outpace emerging threats.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The small deviation reflects that while we face novel risks, human historical resilience and adaptability remain strong factors.

3. **Update magnitude:** Conservative adjustments reflect that most dramatic predictions lack historical validation.

4. **Regression to mean:** The modest increase acknowledges uncertainty while avoiding overconfidence in extreme scenarios.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a historian, I observe that humans have demonstrated extraordinary resilience across millennia of existential challenges. We survived climate shifts, supervolcanic winters, pandemics, and resource collapses that eliminated other species. However, the current period presents genuinely unprecedented risks - nuclear weapons, artificial intelligence, and engineered pandemics - that lack historical precedent for successful navigation.

The historical pattern shows that while mass extinctions occurred, they typically unfolded over geological timescales, allowing adaptation. The concern now is the potential speed of technological risks outpacing human institutional and biological adaptation rates.

Historical precedent suggests humans are remarkably adaptable, but the novelty of current risks and their potential for rapid, cascading effects represents a meaningful departure from historical patterns. The expert surveys, while showing concern, don't reach consensus on extreme probabilities.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Unprecedented extinction rate acceleration, novel technological risks
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Historical human resilience, survival through past catastrophes
- Net direction: SLIGHT UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 1.0%
- Total adjustment: +0.2%
- Final estimate: 1.2%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7

**Probability: 1.2%**
