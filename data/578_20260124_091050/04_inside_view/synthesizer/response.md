## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence spans multiple recent sources (2019-2025) with varying credibility levels. Key observations:

**Recency**: Most relevant information is very recent (2023-2025), particularly AI extinction risk assessments and updated extinction rate data.

**Credibility**: Mix of high-quality sources (Nature, Science journals, Stanford research) and more speculative content (Daily Express sensationalism). Academic sources are generally credible.

**Potential Biases**: 
- Media sources tend toward sensationalism on AI risks
- Academic sources may underestimate novel risks due to conservative methodology
- Current events may create recency bias in risk assessment

**Base Rate Consideration**: The 1.0% base rate appears to focus on historical extinction patterns for large mammals/civilizations but may not fully incorporate modern technological risks that have emerged in the last decade.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- **AI development acceleration**: Multiple independent sources (BBC, RAND, academic surveys) indicate AI researchers themselves estimate significant extinction risks, with some predicting AI autonomy by 2027
- **Expert survey consensus**: 2008 Future of Humanity Institute survey showing 5% extinction probability by 2100 from superintelligence, supported by more recent researcher surveys

**MODERATE Evidence**
- **Accelerated environmental degradation**: UNEP data showing 60% increase in resource extraction by 2050, combined with accelerated modern extinction rates documented in Science journal
- **Sixth mass extinction context**: While not directly about human extinction, documented acceleration of species loss rates provides context for ecosystem collapse risks

**WEAK Evidence**
- **Sensationalized AI predictions**: Daily Express citing "99.9% extinction risk" - lacks methodological rigor
- **General biodiversity crisis**: While concerning, current biodiversity loss doesn't directly translate to near-term human extinction risk

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**Evidence update reasoning:**
- **AI expert consensus**: UP by approximately 2-3 percentage points because multiple independent expert surveys consistently identify AI as a novel, high-impact extinction risk not captured in historical base rates
- **Accelerated technological development timeline**: UP by approximately 1-2 percentage points because the pace of AI development has accelerated beyond historical precedent, compressing risk timelines
- **Environmental acceleration**: UP by approximately 0.5-1 percentage points because resource extraction and ecosystem degradation rates exceed historical patterns used in base rate calculation
- **Expert methodological conservatism**: DOWN by approximately 0.5 percentage points because academic extinction risk assessments may already incorporate some speculative risks

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 1.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +2.5% for AI expert consensus on novel extinction risks
- Adjustment 2: +1.5% for accelerated technological development timelines  
- Adjustment 3: +0.75% for environmental degradation acceleration
- Adjustment 4: -0.5% for potential double-counting of speculative risks
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +4.25%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check**: At 5.25%, this remains a low-probability event. For me to be wrong on the low side, we'd need multiple catastrophic risks to converge simultaneously or AI development to pose even greater risks than expert consensus suggests.

2. **Base rate anchor**: The ~5x increase from base rate is justified by novel technological risks (particularly AI) that weren't present in historical reference classes.

3. **Update magnitude**: Updates are proportional - largest adjustment for strongest evidence (expert AI consensus), smaller adjustments for supporting evidence.

4. **Regression to mean**: The adjustment is substantial but not extreme, maintaining skepticism while acknowledging genuinely novel risk factors.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a synthesizer, I must integrate multiple perspectives while identifying what matters most. The key insight is that we're dealing with a fundamentally different risk landscape than historical reference classes captured in the base rate.

The convergence of expert opinion around AI extinction risks represents genuinely new information. Unlike historical extinction scenarios, AI development could create risks that unfold rapidly and without clear warning signals. Multiple independent sources of AI researchers - the people building these systems - express significant concern about extinction-level risks by 2100.

However, I must balance this against the strong historical precedent that humans have survived numerous existential challenges. The base rate reflects real patterns of resilience and adaptation.

The environmental evidence provides supporting context but isn't independently sufficient for large updates. Climate change and biodiversity loss create stress but rarely cause direct extinction of adaptable species like humans.

My synthesis weighs novel technological risks heavily while maintaining appropriate skepticism about extreme predictions.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: AI expert consensus on extinction risks, accelerated AI development timelines
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Historical human resilience patterns (already in base rate)
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 1.0%
- Total adjustment: +4.25%
- Final estimate: 5.25%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 5.3%**
