# Base Rate Analysis: Human Extinction Before 2100

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The historical data for human extinction events is fundamentally limited because:
- **Sample size of 1**: Homo sapiens has never gone extinct (by definition, since we're here)
- **Observational bias**: We can only observe timelines where humanity survived to the present
- **Limited timeframe**: Modern humans (~300,000 years) represent a tiny fraction of Earth's history
- **Definitional challenges**: What constitutes "extinction" vs. severe population bottlenecks?

Available data sources include:
- Paleontological records of species extinctions
- Archaeological evidence of human population bottlenecks
- Historical records of civilizational collapses
- Actuarial data on species survival rates

The data quality is moderate for related species but inherently limited for the specific question.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Large Mammal Species Extinction Rates**
- Historical base rate: ~1-2% per century for large mammals in recent millennia
- Sample size: Hundreds of large mammal species
- Suitability score: 4/10
- Why this reference class: Humans are large mammals, but we have unique technological and adaptive capabilities that distinguish us from other species. This provides a biological baseline but likely overestimates extinction risk.

**Reference Class 2: Hominid Species Historical Survival**
- Historical base rate: ~95% of hominid species eventually went extinct
- Sample size: ~20-30 known hominid species over 7 million years
- Suitability score: 6/10
- Why this reference class: More taxonomically relevant, but most hominid extinctions occurred over much longer timeframes (tens of thousands of years), and none had modern technology or global civilization.

**Reference Class 3: Human Population Bottlenecks and Recovery**
- Historical base rate: 0% (humans have survived all historical bottlenecks)
- Sample size: Multiple documented bottlenecks (Toba eruption ~74,000 years ago, various ice ages, plagues)
- Suitability score: 8/10
- Why this reference class: Most directly relevant to human resilience specifically. Shows remarkable ability to survive catastrophic events, though sample size is limited and past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation

Breaking down extinction probability:
- P(catastrophic event occurs) × P(event causes extinction | event occurs)

Major risk categories:
- Natural disasters: P(major asteroid/supervolcano) ≈ 0.1% × P(extinction | event) ≈ 10% = 0.01%
- Pandemic: P(severe pandemic) ≈ 5% × P(extinction | pandemic) ≈ 1% = 0.05%
- Technology risks: P(existential tech risk) ≈ 1% × P(extinction | tech risk) ≈ 50% = 0.5%
- Climate/environmental: P(severe climate change) ≈ 10% × P(extinction | climate) ≈ 0.1% = 0.01%

Rough total: ~0.6% (noting these aren't independent events)

## Step 4: Base Rate Integration

Weighting the reference classes:
- Large mammals (weight: 0.2): 1.5% base rate
- Hominid species (weight: 0.3): Adjusted to ~0.5% for 76-year timeframe
- Human bottlenecks (weight: 0.5): 0% historical rate, but adjusted upward for novel risks

Integrated calculation:
(0.2 × 1.5%) + (0.3 × 0.5%) + (0.5 × 0.2%) = 0.3% + 0.15% + 0.1% = 0.55%

The Fermi estimation (~0.6%) provides convergent evidence.

## Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence level: 4/10 (Moderate-low confidence)

This reflects:
- Inherent difficulty of the prediction
- Limited directly applicable historical data
- High uncertainty in novel risk factors
- Fundamental observer bias in the data

---

**Base Rate Estimate:** 0.5%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. Large mammal extinction rates: 1.5% base rate (weight: 0.2)
2. Hominid species survival: 0.5% base rate adjusted for timeframe (weight: 0.3)
3. Human population bottleneck recovery: 0.2% base rate adjusted for novel risks (weight: 0.5)

**Confidence Level:** 4/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Observer bias: We can only observe timelines where humanity survived
- Novel risk factors: Modern technology creates unprecedented risks not captured in historical data
- Definition ambiguity: Unclear whether severe population bottlenecks would count as "extinction"
- Timeframe compression: Most species extinctions occur over much longer periods than 76 years
