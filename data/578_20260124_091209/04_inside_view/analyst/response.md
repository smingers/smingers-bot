## Step 1: Source Analysis

The research provides a mix of recent and established sources, with information spanning from 2019 to 2026. Key observations:

**Recency**: Most relevant climate extinction projections are from 2024-2025, indicating current scientific consensus.

**Credibility**: Sources include Nature, MIT, Stanford, Smithsonian, and peer-reviewed studies - high credibility scientific institutions.

**Potential Biases**: Climate research may have publication bias toward alarming findings; however, the consistency across multiple independent sources reduces this concern.

**Base Rate Integration**: The 0.5% base rate appears to focus on historical extinction patterns for large mammals and hominids, but may not fully incorporate accelerating modern risks like climate change, nuclear weapons, and technological threats.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- **Accelerated extinction rates under human influence**: Multiple sources confirm current extinction rates are 35-1000x higher than background rates, with human activity as the primary driver
- **Climate-driven mass extinction projections**: MIT mathematical models and UConn meta-analysis independently project potential sixth mass extinction by 2100 if current greenhouse gas trends continue
- **Ocean carbon threshold**: MIT research identifies specific carbon threshold that could trigger mass extinction by 2100

**MODERATE Evidence**
- **One-third species extinction by 2100**: Recent 2024 studies suggest 30% of current species could be extinct by 2100 under current climate trajectories
- **Public perception of existential risk**: 25% of Americans believe climate change could cause human extinction (indicates growing awareness of risk)
- **Genus-level extinctions accelerating**: Stanford research shows genus extinctions occurring 18,000x faster than natural rates

**WEAK Evidence**
- **General background extinction rate data**: Historical baseline rates, while informative, don't directly predict human-specific extinction probability
- **Species-specific extinction data**: While concerning for biodiversity, doesn't directly translate to human extinction risk

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**Evidence update reasoning:**
- **Accelerated human-driven extinction rates**: UP by ~0.3 percentage points - establishes that current era represents unprecedented extinction acceleration, suggesting traditional base rates may be too conservative
- **Climate mass extinction models**: UP by ~0.4 percentage points - mathematical models specifically project mass extinction timeline matching our forecast window (by 2100)
- **Ocean carbon threshold research**: UP by ~0.2 percentage points - identifies specific, measurable trigger mechanism with defined timeline
- **One-third species extinction projection**: UP by ~0.2 percentage points - if 30% of species face extinction, humans as a species face elevated risk
- **Genus-level extinction acceleration**: UP by ~0.1 percentage points - shows extinction processes affecting higher taxonomic levels, more relevant to human risk

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 0.5%:
- Adjustment 1: +0.3% for unprecedented human-era extinction acceleration
- Adjustment 2: +0.4% for climate-based mass extinction mathematical models
- Adjustment 3: +0.2% for ocean carbon threshold mechanism
- Adjustment 4: +0.2% for broad species extinction projections
- Adjustment 5: +0.1% for genus-level extinction patterns
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +1.2%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check**: At 1.7%, this remains a low-probability event. For this to be wrong, current climate models would need to be dramatically overstated, human technological adaptation would need to be far more effective than projected, or natural resilience mechanisms would need to be stronger than current evidence suggests.

2. **Base rate anchor**: The +1.2% adjustment represents a significant increase but is justified by the convergence of multiple independent scientific projections specifically targeting the 2100 timeframe.

3. **Update magnitude**: The adjustments are proportional - strongest evidence (mathematical mass extinction models) receives largest weight (+0.4%), weaker correlational evidence receives smaller adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean**: The final estimate remains well within reasonable bounds and doesn't represent an extreme departure from base rates.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst, I observe that the current evidence presents a convergence of multiple independent scientific assessments pointing toward elevated extinction risks by 2100. The key insight is that we're operating in an unprecedented period where human activity has fundamentally altered extinction dynamics.

The mathematical models from MIT and meta-analyses from UConn represent particularly compelling evidence because they:
1. Provide specific timelines matching our forecast window
2. Use quantitative methods rather than speculation
3. Come from independent research teams reaching similar conclusions

The geopolitical implications are significant - climate change represents a collective action problem where individual nation incentives may not align with species survival, potentially accelerating these risks.

However, human adaptability, technological innovation, and the potential for coordinated global response provide counterbalancing factors that prevent this from being a high-probability scenario.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Accelerated extinction rates, climate mass extinction models, ocean carbon thresholds
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None identified in current research
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 0.5%
- Total adjustment: +1.2%
- Final estimate: 1.7%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 1.7%**
