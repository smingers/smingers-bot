## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence is predominantly from 2019-2024, with some very recent 2025-2026 sources. Most sources are credible (Nature, Stanford, MIT, Smithsonian), but there's a critical bias: **nearly all focus on species extinction rates, not human extinction specifically**. The one directly relevant source (Nature 2019) gives an extremely low probability for human extinction (less than 1 in a trillion over 10,000 years). 

**Key bias identified:** The research conflates general biodiversity loss with human extinction risk - a classic availability heuristic error that inflates perceived human extinction risk.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- Nature study on human extinction background rate: Calculates less than 1 in trillion chance over 10,000 years, suggesting base rate may be too HIGH
- Human population growth and resilience: Despite causing mass extinctions, humans continue expanding, showing remarkable adaptability

**MODERATE Evidence**
- Accelerated extinction rates (1000x background): Shows environmental stress but doesn't directly translate to human extinction risk
- Climate predictions of species loss by 2100: Affects human environment but humans have unique technological adaptation capabilities

**WEAK Evidence**
- Public opinion polls about extinction: Reflects fear, not evidence
- General statements about "mass extinction events": Lacks specificity about human vulnerability
- Comparisons to past mass extinctions: Ignores human technological and social adaptations

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**Evidence update reasoning:**
- Nature study on human extinction rates: DOWN by approximately 0.3 percentage points - provides direct evidence that human extinction baseline is extremely low
- Human-caused but human-survived environmental changes: DOWN by approximately 0.1 percentage points - humans are causing the current extinction crisis yet thriving, showing resilience
- Technological adaptation capabilities: DOWN by approximately 0.1 percentage points - humans have tools no previous species had to adapt to environmental changes

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 0.5%:
- Adjustment 1: -0.3% for direct evidence showing much lower background extinction rate
- Adjustment 2: -0.1% for demonstrated human resilience during environmental crisis
- Adjustment 3: -0.1% for unique human technological adaptation capabilities
- **Cumulative adjustment:** -0.5%

**Revised estimate: 0.0%** (but minimum allowed is 0.1%)

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** For 0.1% to be wrong, there would need to be imminent existential threats not captured in current evidence (nuclear war, asteroid impact, engineered pandemic) - but the question asks about extinction, not just catastrophic risk.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 0.5% base rate appears inflated when compared to direct human extinction rate studies rather than general mammalian extinction rates.

3. **Update magnitude:** Large downward adjustment is justified by the mismatch between the reference class (mammals) and the target (technologically advanced humans).

4. **Regression to mean:** Even accounting for regression, the direct evidence strongly suggests lower probability.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian, I'm challenging the implicit assumption that human extinction risk should be modeled like other species. The research reveals a critical flaw in the base rate reasoning: **humans are not just another large mammal species.**

Key contrarian insights:
1. **Survivorship bias in the reference class:** We're using extinction rates of species that actually went extinct, but humans have unique characteristics (technology, global distribution, intentional risk mitigation) that make historical mammalian extinction rates misleading.

2. **The "extinction acceleration paradox":** The very evidence showing accelerated extinction rates demonstrates human dominance over the environment. We're not victims of the current mass extinction - we're the cause, which suggests remarkable environmental control.

3. **Technological discontinuity:** The base rate ignores that humans are the first species with: global communication, space travel capabilities, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, and intentional existential risk research. This represents a fundamental discontinuity from historical reference classes.

4. **Scale mismatch:** The Nature study specifically examining human extinction gives probabilities orders of magnitude lower than the mammalian base rate, suggesting the reference class is fundamentally inappropriate.

The consensus narrative focuses on environmental threats, but overlooks that humans have unprecedented adaptive capabilities and are actively studying and preparing for existential risks in ways no previous species could.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None identified in current research
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Direct human extinction rate studies, demonstrated resilience during environmental crisis
- Net direction: DOWN

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 0.5%
- Total adjustment: -0.4%
- Final estimate: 0.1% (minimum threshold)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7

**Probability: 0.1%**
