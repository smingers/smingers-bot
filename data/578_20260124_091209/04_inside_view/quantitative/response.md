# Quantitative Analysis: Human Extinction Before 2100

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Quality and Recency:**
- Most sources are from 2014-2026, with several from 2024-2025, indicating current relevance
- Sources include Nature, MIT, Stanford, Smithsonian - high credibility academic institutions
- Some sources are news reports interpreting scientific studies rather than primary research
- Wikipedia and Reddit sources have lower credibility but may aggregate useful data

**Potential Biases:**
- Media tends to emphasize alarming predictions for engagement
- Academic sources may be more conservative but focus on species extinction generally, not human-specific
- Selection bias toward dramatic predictions in search results

**Information likely NOT priced into base rate:**
- Recent acceleration in extinction rates due to climate change
- Specific mathematical models predicting mass extinction by 2100
- Current quantitative data on extinction rate acceleration

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- Nature study on background extinction rates with mathematical modeling
- MIT mathematical prediction of sixth mass extinction by 2100 due to ocean carbon levels
- Stanford study showing genus extinctions occurring 18,000x faster than natural rates
- Multiple studies confirming current extinction rates are 100-1000x background rates

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- UConn meta-analysis predicting 1/3 of species extinct by 2100 under current warming
- IPBES data showing 10-100x higher extinction rates than historical average
- Specific quantitative estimates (30,000 species/year vs. natural 1 species/million/year)

**WEAK Evidence:**
- Public polling data on beliefs about human extinction
- General statements about biodiversity crisis without human-specific analysis
- Reddit discussions and social media posts

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**Evidence Updates:**

- **MIT ocean carbon model (UP +0.15%)**: Mathematical model specifically predicting conditions for mass extinction by 2100, with clear mechanism through ocean acidification and carbon thresholds

- **Accelerated extinction rates (UP +0.1%)**: Current rates 100-1000x background suggest we're in unprecedented territory, increasing systemic risk to human survival

- **Climate-driven species loss projections (UP +0.05%)**: 1/3 of species extinct by 2100 indicates ecosystem collapse scenarios that threaten human food security and habitability

- **Genus-level extinctions accelerating (UP +0.05%)**: Elimination of entire genera suggests systemic rather than isolated threats, indicating higher-order ecological breakdown

- **Human population size and technology (DOWN -0.1%)**: Current 8+ billion population with global distribution and advanced technology provides resilience not captured in base rate

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 0.5%:
- Adjustment 1: +0.15% for MIT mathematical extinction model
- Adjustment 2: +0.1% for unprecedented extinction rate acceleration  
- Adjustment 3: +0.05% for ecosystem collapse projections
- Adjustment 4: +0.05% for genus-level extinction patterns
- Adjustment 5: -0.1% for human technological resilience and population distribution
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +0.25%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** At 0.75%, this remains a low-probability event requiring either sudden catastrophic change or cascading ecosystem collapse. For this to be wrong, either climate models are severely underestimating impacts or human adaptability is severely overestimated.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 0.25% increase (50% relative increase) is justified by quantitative evidence of unprecedented rates of change not present in historical base rates.

3. **Update magnitude:** Updates are proportional - largest adjustment (+0.15%) comes from strongest evidence (peer-reviewed mathematical model with specific timeline).

4. **Regression to mean:** The modest adjustment acknowledges uncertainty while incorporating new quantitative data.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a quantitative analyst, I focus on the mathematical and statistical evidence. The most compelling data points are:

1. **Rate Analysis**: Current extinction rates are 100-1000x background rates, representing a 2-3 order of magnitude acceleration. This suggests we're in a fundamentally different regime than historical periods used for base rate calculation.

2. **Mathematical Models**: The MIT study provides a specific mathematical framework predicting mass extinction conditions by 2100 based on ocean carbon thresholds. This is quantitatively grounded rather than speculative.

3. **Trend Extrapolation**: The Stanford data showing genus extinctions occurring at 18,000x natural rates indicates exponential rather than linear degradation, suggesting potential for cascading failures.

4. **Population Dynamics**: However, human population size (8+ billion) and global distribution provide significant buffer against extinction compared to typical mammalian species. The quantitative resilience factors partially offset the increased environmental pressures.

The key quantitative insight is that we appear to be in a regime change - the current rate of environmental degradation is orders of magnitude beyond the historical data used to establish base rates. This justifies a meaningful but modest upward adjustment.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: MIT extinction model, 100-1000x extinction rates, genus-level extinctions, ecosystem collapse projections
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Large distributed human population, technological adaptation capabilities
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 0.5%
- Total adjustment: +0.25%
- Final estimate: 0.75%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 0.75%**
