## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence quality is mixed but concerning:

**Recency**: Most sources are very recent (2023-2026), with several from the last year discussing accelerating extinction rates and climate impacts.

**Credibility**: High-quality sources include Nature, MIT, Stanford, Smithsonian, and peer-reviewed studies. These are credible scientific institutions.

**Potential Biases**: Some sources may have selection bias toward alarming findings (more likely to be published/reported). However, the consistency across multiple independent sources suggests real trends.

**Already Priced In**: The base rate appears to use historical extinction patterns but may not fully account for recent acceleration in climate change and biodiversity loss.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- **Accelerating extinction rates**: Multiple sources confirm current species extinction rates are 35-1000x higher than background rates due to human activity
- **Climate change projections**: MIT mathematical models predict potential sixth mass extinction by 2100 if current carbon trends continue
- **One-third species extinction risk**: Meta-analysis suggests 1/3 of species could go extinct by 2100 under current warming trajectories

**MODERATE Evidence**
- **Historical precedent**: Five previous mass extinctions show such events are possible, though none involved a technological species
- **Public perception**: 25% of Americans believe climate change could cause human extinction (indicates growing concern but not expert assessment)
- **Ocean carbon thresholds**: Specific predictions about ocean carbon triggering mass extinction events

**WEAK Evidence**
- **General biodiversity statistics**: Background extinction rates, while concerning, don't directly predict human extinction
- **Genus-level extinctions**: Human-driven genus extinctions, while unprecedented, don't directly translate to human extinction risk

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**Evidence update reasoning:**
- **Accelerating climate/biodiversity crisis**: UP by ~0.3 percentage points - represents genuinely new information about the pace of environmental degradation since historical base rates were established
- **Mathematical models predicting mass extinction by 2100**: UP by ~0.2 percentage points - provides specific timeframe alignment with our question
- **Technological civilization vulnerability**: UP by ~0.1 percentage points - unlike previous species, humans have created additional systemic risks through technology and global interconnectedness
- **Human adaptability and technology**: DOWN by ~0.2 percentage points - humans have unprecedented ability to adapt, migrate, and develop solutions compared to other species

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 0.5%:
- Adjustment 1: +0.3% for accelerating environmental crisis beyond historical norms
- Adjustment 2: +0.2% for specific mathematical models predicting mass extinction by 2100
- Adjustment 3: +0.1% for unique vulnerabilities of technological civilization
- Adjustment 4: -0.2% for human adaptability advantages
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +0.4%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check**: At 0.9%, this remains a low-probability event. For this to be wrong, either environmental collapse would need to be less severe than models suggest, or human adaptability would need to be even greater than assumed.

2. **Base rate anchor**: The 0.4 percentage point increase (80% relative increase) is justified by genuinely new information about accelerating environmental pressures not fully captured in historical extinction patterns.

3. **Update magnitude**: The adjustments are proportional - largest weight given to strongest evidence (accelerating environmental crisis).

4. **Regression to mean**: The modest adjustment avoids overweighting recent concerning news while acknowledging genuine changes in risk factors.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a synthesizer, I must balance multiple concerning trends against human adaptability. The evidence shows we're in an unprecedented period of environmental change - extinction rates 35-1000x higher than background, mathematical models predicting potential mass extinction by 2100, and climate projections suggesting one-third of species could disappear.

However, humans differ fundamentally from other species in our technological capabilities, global communication, and adaptive capacity. We can potentially engineer solutions, migrate to different environments, and coordinate global responses in ways no previous species could.

The key insight is that while we face genuinely novel risks at an accelerated pace, we also have novel capabilities. The net effect is a modest but meaningful increase in extinction probability above historical base rates.

The most concerning factor is the compressed timeframe - previous mass extinctions occurred over much longer periods, potentially giving less time for adaptation. However, our technological capabilities also operate on compressed timeframes.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Accelerating extinction rates, climate models predicting mass extinction by 2100, mathematical projections of ecosystem collapse
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Human technological adaptability, global coordination capabilities, historical resilience through bottlenecks
- Net direction: UP (modest increase)

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 0.5%
- Total adjustment: +0.4%
- Final estimate: 0.9%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 6/10

**Probability: 0.9%**
