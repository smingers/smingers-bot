# Base Rate Analysis: Human Extinction Before 2100

## Step 1: Source Analysis

### Available Data Sources:
- **Paleontological records**: Extinction patterns of mammalian species over millions of years
- **Historical records**: Human survival over ~300,000 years of Homo sapiens existence
- **Species longevity data**: Typical lifespans of mammalian species
- **Civilization continuity**: Records of major civilizations and their collapse patterns

### Reliability Assessment:
- **Strengths**: We have excellent data on species extinction rates, reasonable archaeological records of human history
- **Limitations**: 
  - Sample size of n=1 for technologically advanced civilizations
  - No historical precedent for human extinction events
  - Survivorship bias (we can only observe this from a timeline where humans haven't gone extinct)
  - Recent technological changes may make historical patterns less relevant

### Systematic Biases:
- **Survivorship bias**: We exist to ask this question, suggesting past extinction probabilities were successfully navigated
- **Recency bias**: Most detailed data comes from recent centuries when extinction risk may differ
- **Anthropic bias**: Our existence proves all previous extinction risks were avoided

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

### Reference Class 1: Mammalian Species Extinction Rates
- **Historical base rate**: ~1-2% per 10,000 years for typical mammalian species; ~0.8-1.6% over 76 years
- **Sample size**: Thousands of mammalian species over millions of years
- **Suitability score**: 4/10
- **Reasoning**: Humans share biological characteristics with other mammals, but our intelligence, adaptability, global distribution, and technology make us fundamentally different. Most species extinctions result from habitat loss, climate change, or competition - factors humans can potentially mitigate. However, this provides a biological baseline for species persistence.

### Reference Class 2: Human Survival Track Record (Historical Periods)
- **Historical base rate**: 0% extinction over ~300,000 years of Homo sapiens existence (or ~3,900 76-year periods)
- **Sample size**: N=1 species observed continuously
- **Suitability score**: 6/10
- **Reasoning**: Most directly relevant reference class - actual human survival history. Humans have survived ice ages, volcanic winters (Toba eruption ~74,000 years ago), plagues, and wars. However, technological capabilities have changed dramatically in recent decades, potentially altering the risk profile. The fact that we've survived all previous periods doesn't guarantee future survival (the "turkey problem" - fed every day until Thanksgiving).

### Reference Class 3: Genus-Level Survival (Homo genus)
- **Historical base rate**: The Homo genus has existed for ~2.8 million years; multiple Homo species have gone extinct (H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis, H. heidelbergensis, etc.)
- **Species within genus extinction rate**: ~90%+ of Homo species have gone extinct
- **Suitability score**: 3/10
- **Reasoning**: Shows that human-like species can and do go extinct. However, H. sapiens has unique characteristics (cognitive abilities, technology, global distribution) that distinguish us from other Homo species. Limited applicability due to small sample size and different ecological niches.

### Reference Class 4: Large-Bodied, Widespread Mammalian Species
- **Historical base rate**: Very low extinction rate over 76-year periods; species like rats, wolves, and bears have persisted for hundreds of thousands of years
- **Sample size**: Dozens of species
- **Suitability score**: 5/10
- **Reasoning**: Humans share key survival traits with these species: large geographic range, dietary flexibility, behavioral adaptability. Wide distribution is particularly protective against extinction. However, humans face unique risks from technology that these species don't face.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation

Given the unique nature of this question, let me decompose by risk categories:

**P(extinction by 2100) = P(nuclear war causes extinction) + P(pandemic causes extinction) + P(other catastrophic risks)**

Using historical base rates:
- **P(civilization-threatening nuclear exchange in 76 years)**: No historical precedent, but ~0 such events in 79 years of nuclear age ≈ very low baseline
- **P(natural pandemic causes extinction)**: 0 events in recorded history despite numerous pandemics; even Black Death killed ~30-60% regionally
- **P(asteroid/supervolcano)**: ~0 extinction-level events in 300,000 years of human existence

This approach suggests base rates well under 1% for any single category, but faces the challenge that we're in unprecedented technological territory.

## Step 4: Base Rate Integration

### Weighting Approach:
- **Reference Class 1** (Mammalian extinction): Weight = 0.15 → contributes ~0.2%
- **Reference Class 2** (Human track record): Weight = 0.50 → contributes ~0.1% (using 1/3900 periods as rough estimate, though 0 observed events)
- **Reference Class 3** (Homo genus): Weight = 0.10 → contributes ~0.3%
- **Reference Class 4** (Widespread mammals): Weight = 0.25 → contributes ~0.1%

### Integration Logic:
The strongest signal comes from human survival history (300,000 years, including through multiple existential-seeming threats). However, we must account for:
1. The unprecedented nature of modern technology
2. The relatively short timeframe (76 years vs. evolutionary timescales)
3. The fact that 0 observed extinctions doesn't mean 0% probability

**Integrated base rate calculation**: 
- Pure historical survival rate suggests <0.5%
- Adjusting for the fact that we're asking about a relatively short period (76 years) where catastrophic but rare events are unlikely to occur
- Conservative estimate accounting for unknown unknowns: **0.5-1%**

## Step 5: Confidence Assessment

**Confidence: 4/10** (Moderate-low confidence)

**Reasoning:**
- We have good data on species extinction patterns
- We have excellent data on human survival history
- However, the question asks about an unprecedented situation (technologically advanced humanity)
- Sample size of n=1 for our specific reference class
- Fundamental uncertainty about tail risks
- The base rate is heavily influenced by the fact that we're asking about a relatively short time period

**Base Rate Estimate: 0.5%**

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. Human survival track record (300,000 years): <0.03% per 76-year period (weight: 0.50)
2. Widespread mammalian species persistence: ~0.8-1.6% per 76 years (weight: 0.25)
3. Mammalian species extinction rates: ~1% per 76 years (weight: 0.15)
4. Homo genus species survival: Variable, mostly extinct (weight: 0.10)

**Confidence Level: 4/10**

**Key Uncertainties:**
- **Technological discontinuity**: Modern technology (nuclear weapons, bioengineering, AI) represents a fundamental break from historical conditions, potentially making historical base rates less relevant
- **Sample size problem**: We only have one observation of human civilization, and no observations of extinction, making statistical inference extremely difficult
- **Tail risk quantification**: Rare catastrophic events are by definition poorly captured in historical data
- **Time horizon mismatch**: Most reference classes operate on evolutionary timescales (thousands to millions of years), while we're asking about 76 years
- **Anthropic bias**: Our ability to observe and ask this question is conditional on non-extinction, potentially biasing our estimates downward
