**Reference Class Analysis**:
Looking at the reference classes, I see a mixed success pattern for BotStudio's initiatives:

Success Rate Breakdown:
- Successful Initiatives (6/10): 60%
- Failed Initiatives (4/10): 40%

Key Observations:
- Technical/Product Initiatives: Higher success rate
  - Pre-tuned Model Marketplace (89% success)
  - Internal OpsBot (89% success)
  - Funding/Partnership Initiatives (79-88% success)

- Sales/Marketing Initiatives: Lower success rate
  - Vertical Expansions: Mixed (Healthcare/Finance failed, Retail succeeded)
  - Marketing Campaigns: Lower success probability (Content marketing, Paid ads failed)

**Team Context Factors**:
- Team's Brier Score (0.257): Indicates moderate forecasting calibration
- Stronger in technical product development
- More variable in market-facing initiatives
- Leadership (Jordan Lee) has strong track record in product development

**Specific Initiative Considerations**:
- Technical feasibility: High (performance benchmarking tool)
- Strategic alignment: Strong (builds platform trust)
- Complexity: Moderate (requires cross-team collaboration)

**Outside View Probability**: 65%
Rationale:
- Base success rate from similar initiatives: 60%
- Slight adjustment up due to:
  1. Technical nature of the project
  2. Clear strategic value
  3. Involvement of technical leadership

Confidence interval: 55-75%

Key Uncertainties:
- Beta client adoption
- Actual upsell conversion impact
- Engineering/product team execution

The 65% estimate reflects genuine uncertainty while acknowledging the initiative's promising aspects.
