**Reference Class Analysis**:
Examining the reference classes, I see 6 binary success/failure decisions:
- Successes: 5/10 (50%)
- Successful initiatives often involve technical development or strategic pivots
- Failures tend to occur in sales-driven or marketing-focused initiatives

The most relevant reference cases are technical development projects like:
- Pre-Tuned Model Marketplace (89% forecast, successful)
- Internal OpsBot Development (89% forecast, successful)
- These were led by Jordan Lee (same leader as current initiative)

**Team Context Factors**:
- Team's Brier Score of 0.257 indicates moderate forecasting calibration
- Tends to be more successful in product/engineering initiatives
- Shows ability to execute technical product developments
- Demonstrates pattern of strategic technical innovations

Notable observations:
- Strong track record when Jordan Lee leads technical initiatives
- Higher success rate for internal tool development
- Moderate risk tolerance with technical projects

**Outside View Probability**: 65%
Justification:
- Base rate of similar technical initiatives suggests moderate likelihood of success
- Team's historical performance and Jordan Lee's track record boost confidence
- Technical feasibility seems high, but market adoption introduces uncertainty
- Specific metrics (90% accuracy, 75% client adoption) add complexity

Adjustment factors:
- (+) Technical leadership by experienced CTO
- (+) Clear success criteria
- (-) Ambitious multi-dimensional success metrics
- (-) Potential market adoption challenges

The 65% reflects a cautiously optimistic base rate, acknowledging both the team's capabilities and the inherent uncertainties in product development and market validation.
