**Reference Class Analysis**:
Looking at the 10 reference cases, I see:
- 6 binary success/failure decisions
- Success rate: 6/10 (60%)
- Particularly relevant are technology/product development initiatives like:
  - Pre-Tuned Model Marketplace (89% forecast, succeeded)
  - Internal OpsBot Development (89% forecast, succeeded)
  - Vertical expansion attempts (mixed success: retail/healthcare/finance varied)

**Team Context Factors**:
- Moderate Brier Score (0.257) suggests reasonable but not exceptional forecasting
- Stronger performance in product development and platform feature expansion
- Weaker performance in sales/marketing initiatives
- Team tends to be slightly overconfident (several high-confidence forecasts)

**Calibration Adjustments**:
- Technical initiatives seem more reliable (80-90% success)
- Customer-facing tools with adoption metrics have higher uncertainty
- Four-month timeline is relatively tight for complex tool development

**Outside View Probability**: 65%
Rationale:
- Base rate of similar initiatives suggests moderate success likelihood
- Specific factors (technical complexity, clear metrics) slightly improve odds
- Adjustment for potential implementation challenges
- Accounts for team's historical 60% success rate with nuanced weighting toward technical initiatives

**Key Uncertainty Factors**:
- Beta client adoption (75% threshold)
- Upsell conversion impact
- Technical integration complexity

The 65% reflects genuine uncertainty while grounding the estimate in observable historical performance.
