**Reference Class Analysis**:
Looking at the 10 reference cases, the binary success rate breaks down as:
- Successful Outcomes: 7/10 (70%)
- Failed Outcomes: 3/10 (30%)

Key observations:
- Strong success in technical development (OpsBot, Pre-Tuned Marketplace)
- Mixed success in sales/marketing initiatives
- High success rate in funding/strategic pivots
- Moderate success in vertical expansions

**Team Context Factors**:
- Brier Score of 0.257 indicates moderate forecasting calibration
- Team demonstrates ability to adapt and pivot
- Technical execution seems stronger than market expansion
- Leadership (Jordan, Alex, Casey) shows consistent strategic thinking

Specific nuances:
- Technical initiatives (platform features) have higher success probability
- Market-facing initiatives show more variability
- The AI Model Performance Benchmarking Tool is technically oriented, which favors success

**Contextual Adjustments**:
- Technical complexity: Moderate
- Cross-team collaboration required: Yes
- Clear success metrics: Strongly defined
- Time frame: 4 months (reasonable)

**Planning Fallacy Adjustment**:
- Typical overestimation: -15-20% probability
- Specific mitigation: Well-defined metrics

**Outside View Probability**: 65%
Rationale: Base rate of 70% technical success, adjusted down for market adoption complexity and cross-team coordination challenges. The clear metrics and technical focus provide confidence, but market validation introduces uncertainty.

The 65% reflects a cautiously optimistic view that slightly favors success, acknowledging both the team's capabilities and the inherent challenges in launching a new tool.
