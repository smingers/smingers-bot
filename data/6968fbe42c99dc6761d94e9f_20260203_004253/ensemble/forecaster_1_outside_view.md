**Reference Class Analysis**:
Looking at the reference classes, there's significant variability in success rates:

Successful Initiatives (>80% forecast):
- Series A Funding (79%, succeeded)
- Retail Vertical Expansion (85%, succeeded)
- AI Consultancy Partnerships (88%, succeeded)
- Pre-Tuned Model Marketplace (89%, succeeded)
- Internal OpsBot Development (89%, succeeded)
- Seed Round Funding (84%, succeeded)

Failed Initiatives (<30% forecast):
- Healthcare Vertical Expansion (17%, failed)
- Finance Vertical Expansion (22%, failed)
- Paid Ads Campaign (47%, failed)
- Content Marketing Campaign (55%, failed)

Notably, the most similar context is the previous attempts to expand into finance and healthcare verticals, which both failed. This suggests significant skepticism is warranted.

**Team Context Factors**:
- Team's Brier Score of 0.257 indicates moderate forecasting calibration
- Mixed track record of vertical expansions
- Strong performance in product development and fundraising
- Weaker performance in direct sales and marketing initiatives
- Compliance/certification efforts have not been directly tested before

Key Observation: The team tends to be overly optimistic in forecasts, with many initiatives falling short of expectations despite high confidence.

**Outside View Probability**: 35%
Justification:
- Base rate from similar vertical expansion attempts is low (17-22%)
- Compliance removal is not guaranteed to solve underlying sales challenges
- Team's historical success rate suggests cautious optimism
- Specific challenges in finance/healthcare verticals previously encountered
- Personalized outreach and compliance certification provide some uplift from lowest base rates

Calibration Notes:
- The 35% reflects genuine uncertainty
- Accounts for both potential success factors and historical barriers
- Acknowledges the specific challenges of re-engaging previously blocked prospects
- Recognizes that compliance was likely not the only barrier in previous attempts

The probability intentionally sits below 50% to reflect the skepticism warranted by past performance while leaving room for the possibility of success through improved approach and compliance certification.
