Let's systematically analyze this forecast:

**Outside View Base Rate**: 42%
- Historical vertical expansion attempts in finance/healthcare show low success rates
- Previous enterprise sales initiatives struggled with complex conversion barriers

1. Targeted approach with 15 pre-identified prospects
2. Specific compliance certifications (SOC 2, GDPR) directly address previous objections
3. Personalized outreach strategy shows strategic thoughtfulness
4. Team has demonstrated ability to learn and pivot from previous failures

Negative Factors (-7%):
1. Compliance might not be the only/primary sales blocker
2. Historical difficulty penetrating regulated industries
3. Potential hidden sales friction beyond compliance
4. Risk that prospects have moved on or found alternative solutions

**Calibration Considerations**:
- Team's forecasts range from 40-75%, suggesting significant internal uncertainty
- Careful approach suggests non-trivial probability of partial success
- Success criteria are specific and challenging (3+ contracts, $15k/month)

**Probability Rationale**:
- Base rate: 42%
- Positive adjustments: +15%
- Negative adjustments: -7%
- Net adjustment: +8%

**Final Probability Calculation**: 50%
