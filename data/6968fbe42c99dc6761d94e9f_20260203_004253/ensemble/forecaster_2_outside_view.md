**Reference Class Analysis**:
Looking at the reference classes, there's significant variability in success rates:

Vertically-focused sales initiatives show mixed results:
- Healthcare Vertical Expansion: 17% success (Failed)
- Finance Vertical Expansion: 22% success (Failed)
- Retail Vertical Expansion: 85% success (Succeeded)

Sales and market expansion initiatives overall:
- Succeeded: 4/6 (66.7%)
- Failed: 2/6 (33.3%)

The specific context of re-engaging previously compliance-blocked prospects adds complexity, as this is a unique scenario not directly mirrored in past reference classes.

**Team Context Factors**:
- Team's Brier Score of 0.257 suggests moderate forecasting calibration
- Strong performance in partnership and internal development initiatives
- Weaker performance in vertical market expansions
- Compliance certification provides a new lever not previously available

Relevant nuances:
- Previous finance/healthcare vertical failures suggest inherent market entry challenges
- SOC 2 and GDPR certifications represent a material change in approach
- Personalized re-engagement strategy differs from previous broad outreach

**Outside View Probability**: 55%
Justification:
- Base rate of similar initiatives suggests moderate likelihood of success
- Compliance certification provides a meaningful differentiation
- Historical vertical expansion challenges temper pure optimism
- Specific, targeted approach increases probability compared to previous attempts

**Calibration Considerations**:
- Account for potential overconfidence in compliance solving all barriers
- Recognize multiple potential failure modes beyond compliance
- The 55% reflects genuine uncertainty about whether compliance was the primary blocker

Key Uncertainty Factors:
- Actual customer motivation beyond compliance
- Pricing and product fit still unknown
- Limited sample size (15 prospects)
- Six-month engagement timeline

Recommendation: Treat this as a learning opportunity with clear success criteria, prepared to pivot if initial engagement doesn't show promising signals.
