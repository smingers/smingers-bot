Let's systematically analyze this forecast:

**Outside View Base Rate**: 55%
- Reference class shows 66.7% success in market expansion initiatives
- Specific vertical expansions (finance/healthcare) previously failed at ~20%
- SOC 2/GDPR certifications represent a novel intervention

**Inside View Adjustments**:

Positive Factors (+10%):
- Targeted re-engagement with previously interested prospects

**Strong Arguments AGAINST Success**:
- Compliance might not be the real barrier
- Potential misunderstanding of prospect needs
- Competitive landscape changes
- Potential pricing or product-fit issues

**Calibration Checks**:
- Avoiding overconfidence: ✓
- Considered failure modes: ✓
- Probability reflects genuine uncertainty: ✓

**Final Probability Calculation**:
Base Rate: 55%
Positive Adjustments: +10%
Negative Adjustments: -5%

**Probability: 60%**

Rationale: The 60% reflects genuine uncertainty, slightly above the base rate due to targeted intervention, but acknowledging significant potential failure modes. This probability suggests:
- Moderate confidence in success
- Clear recognition of substantial challenges
- Openness to learning and pivoting

Probability: 60%
