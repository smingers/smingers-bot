- High variability in sales-driven outcomes

**Planning Fallacy Adjustment**:
- Six-month timeline suggests potential overoptimism

- Compliance certification provides a new approach
- Historical challenges in finance/healthcare verticals
- Moderate team forecasting accuracy
- Specific re-engagement strategy introduces nuanced complexity

The 42% reflects:
- Acknowledgment of past struggles
- Potential impact of compliance certification
