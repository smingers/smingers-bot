**Reference Class Analysis**:
Examining the team's past binary initiatives reveals a mixed success pattern:

Successful Initiatives (7/10):
- Seed & Series A Funding: 84-79% success
- Vertical Expansion (Retail): 85% success
- Pivot to AI Consultancy Partnerships: 88% success
- Pre-Tuned Model Marketplace: 89% success
- Internal OpsBot Development: 89% success

Failed Initiatives (3/10):
- Healthcare Vertical Expansion: 17% success
- Finance Vertical Expansion: 22% success
- Paid Ads Campaign: 47% success
- Content Marketing Campaign: 55% success

Notably, this specific initiative involves re-entering verticals (finance, healthcare) where they previously failed, which introduces additional complexity.

**Team Context Factors**:
- Moderate Brier Score (0.257) suggests reasonable but imperfect forecasting
- Team shows higher success rates in internal development vs. external market expansion
- Compliance and certification efforts represent a novel approach to previous failed vertical expansions
- Leadership (Alex/Casey) has mixed track record in vertical market penetration

**Outside View Probability**: 45%
Rationale:
- Base rate of success from reference classes: ~70%
- Discount applied due to:
  1. Previous failures in targeted verticals
  2. Uncertainty about true compliance blocking factors
  3. Complex enterprise sales cycle
  4. Specific constraints (3+ contracts, $15k/month minimum)

The 45% reflects genuine uncertainty, acknowledging both potential for success and significant challenges in enterprise sales transformation.

**Calibration Notes**:
- This is not a coin flip, but reflects meaningful doubt
- Success depends on multiple interdependent factors
- Compliance certification is necessary but not sufficient condition

The forecast intentionally sits below the team's historical success rate to account for the specific challenges of this initiative.
