You are analyzing a business forecasting question to establish a base rate (outside view).

**Question**: Convert Compliance-Blocked Enterprise Prospects into Signed Contracts

**Success Criteria**: * 3+ signed enterprise contracts from the compliance-blocked prospect list
* $15,000/month minimum total revenue from these converted deals
* At least one contract from finance or healthcare vertical (proving we can re-enter those markets)

**Additional Context**: After achieving SOC 2 Type II and GDPR certifications (expected completion by March 2026), test whether compliance was the primary blocker preventing enterprise deals. Alex and Casey lead this sales initiative, re-engaging 15 enterprise prospects who previously cited compliance requirements as the reason for not moving forward—including prospects from the failed finance and healthcare vertical expansions. The bet assumes that certification removes the blocker and these prospects will convert, but acknowledges uncertainty about whether compliance was the real issue versus pricing, product fit, competitive positioning, or other factors. The effort involves personalized outreach, updated security documentation, and demos highlighting compliance capabilities over a six-month period post-certification.
