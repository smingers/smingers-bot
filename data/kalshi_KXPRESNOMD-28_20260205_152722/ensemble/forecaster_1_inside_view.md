## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **Harris Currently Leading in Most Recent Polls (February 2026)**
   - The Hill (Feb 5): Harris ahead by 6 points average; Harvard-Harris: 39% vs 30%; January YouGov: 23% vs 19%
   - Multiple independent sources confirming same direction
   - **BUT:** Polymarket shows opposite (Newsom 32% vs Harris 6%), suggesting disconnect between polls and betting markets
   - **Interpretation:** Polls measure current sentiment; markets may reflect perceived electability or insider knowledge

2. **Newsom's Structural Advantages**
   - Largest federal PAC ($3.9M-4M)
   - California donor base
   - High visibility anti-Trump positioning
   - Nate Silver: "by far the top choice in prediction markets"
   - **Causal mechanism:** Money + visibility = ability to compete nationally

3. **Historical Pattern: Former VPs After Loss**
   - Reference class: VPs who lose presidential election rarely get renominated
   - Carville (expert): Harris has "no chance" due to 2024 association
   - **BUT:** Harris currently polling ahead contradicts this expert judgment
   - **Interpretation:** Expert opinion vs. current voter sentiment divergence

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

1. **Pritzker's Rising Profile**
   - Carville endorsement based on fundraising + Black community acceptance
   - Personal wealth advantage
   - Recent polls show 7-9% support
   - **Causal mechanism:** Can self-fund + build coalition

2. **Shapiro's Pennsylvania Advantage**
   - $30.2M state war chest
   - Swing state governor
   - 5-6% in current polls
   - **Limitation:** Limited national infrastructure vs. Newsom/Harris

3. **AOC's Progressive Lane**
   - Consistent 8-12% across multiple polls
   - "Unusually clear" left lane (Silver)
   - Will be 38 in 2028 (eligible)
   - **Limitation:** Divisive; may face establishment intervention

4. **Buttigieg's Communication Skills**
   - 5-11% across polls
   - Previous campaign experience
   - **Limitation:** Silver notes "persistent lack of support with Black voters"

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

1. **Whitmer, Beshear, Moore, Kelly, etc.**
   - Various positioning activities but low polling (1-3%)
   - Anecdotal campaign appearances
   - **Assessment:** Viable but currently second-tier

2. **Non-Politicians (Cuban, Stewart, celebrities)**
   - No serious evidence of campaigns
   - Prediction markets show 1-2% for entertainment value

3. **Constitutionally Ineligible/Extremely Unlikely**
   - Barack Obama (ineligible), Sanders (87 years old), Michelle Obama (repeatedly declined)
   - Should be <0.1% each

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeline:** February 5, 2026 to Democratic Convention (likely July/August 2028) = 29-30 months

**If timeframe halved (15 months to convention):**
- Current polling would be MUCH more predictive
- Fundraising infrastructure would be locked in
- Would dramatically increase confidence in top 2-3 candidates
- Harris's current polling lead would translate to 35-40% probability
- Newsom 25-30%, others compressed below 10%

**If timeframe doubled (60 months out, equivalent to early 2024 for 2028):**
- Current polling nearly meaningless
- Would distribute probabilities much more evenly
- Top candidate perhaps 15-18%, next tier 8-12%
- Higher probability for unknown/unlisted candidates

**Historical precedent at 29 months:**
- February 2006 for 2008: Clinton led polls but Obama won
- February 2018 for 2020: Biden led but faced serious competition from Warren/Sanders
- **Pattern:** Front-runner at this stage wins ~50% of time; significant volatility possible

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rates:**
- Newsom: 24%
- Harris: 18%
- Shapiro: 14%
- Buttigieg: 11%
- Pritzker: 8%

**Key Shifts Based on Current Information:**

**1. Harris UPWARD (18% → 22-25%)**
- **Justification:** Most recent polling (Feb 2026) shows Harris leading by 6 points average
- The Hill analysis is comprehensive and current
- Harvard-Harris poll (Feb 1) shows 39% vs 30%
- Despite Carville's skepticism, actual voter sentiment favors Harris NOW
- Historical pattern of VPs struggling is concerning, but current data contradicts it
- **Magnitude:** Moderate upward shift warranted by strong recent polling evidence

**2. Newsom DOWNWARD (24% → 20-22%)**
- **Justification:** Polymarket shows 32% but most recent voter polls show him trailing Harris
- Disconnect between betting markets and voter polls suggests overconfidence in markets
- Still has structural advantages (money, visibility) but current voter sentiment less favorable
- **Magnitude:** Modest downward adjustment; remains co-frontrunner

**3. Pritzker UPWARD (8% → 9-11%)**
- **Justification:** Carville (expert) endorsement is significant
- Recent polls show 7-9%, consistent upward trajectory
- Unique combination of self-funding + Black community acceptance
- **Magnitude:** Small upward shift based on expert opinion + polling momentum

**4. AOC STABLE (3% → 8-10%)**
- **Justification:** Consistently polling 8-12% across multiple sources
- Outside view severely underweighted her
- Clear progressive lane with Sanders not running
- **Magnitude:** Significant upward correction to match polling data

**5. Shapiro DOWNWARD (14% → 10-12%)**
- **Justification:** Outside view was too optimistic
- Current polls show 5-6%, not 14%
- Still viable but less prominent than initially assessed
- **Magnitude:** Moderate downward adjustment to match reality

**6. Buttigieg STABLE (11% → 9-11%)**
- **Justification:** Polls show 5-11% range
- Outside view roughly correct
- Communication skills + previous experience maintain viability

# Probability Calibration

**Key Calibration Considerations:**

1. **Poll vs. Market Divergence:** Harris leads polls but Newsom leads Polymarket. This suggests:
   - Polls measure current voter sentiment
   - Markets may reflect electability perceptions or insider knowledge
   - **Decision:** Weight recent polls (Feb 2026) heavily but don't ignore market signal entirely

2. **Expert Opinion vs. Data:** Carville says Harris has "no chance" but she's polling first. 
   - **Decision:** Trust data over single expert opinion when they conflict
   - But incorporate Carville's Pritzker endorsement as signal

3. **Time Horizon:** 29 months is long enough for significant changes but short enough that current positioning matters
   - **Decision:** Top candidates should get 60-70% combined probability
   - Reserve 10-15% for candidates currently polling 1-3%
   - Reserve 5-10% for true surprises/unlisted candidates

4. **Overconfidence Check:** 
   - 2008 showed major upset possible (Obama over Clinton)
   - Should avoid putting >30% on any single candidate
   - Small probability differences matter: 25% vs 20% is 5:4 odds

5. **Blind Spots:**
   - 2026 midterm results could dramatically shift landscape
   - Unexpected candidate entry (e.g., major figure not currently discussed)
   - Harris's actual decision to run or not
   - Major political events in next 6 months

**Final Distribution Strategy:**

**Tier 1 (Combined ~50%):**
- Harris: 25% (current polling leader + VP experience)
- Newsom: 21% (structural advantages + market favorite, but trailing polls)

**Tier 2 (Combined ~30%):**
- Shapiro: 11% (swing state governor + war chest)
- Buttigieg: 10% (consistent polling + experience)
- Pritzker: 9% (expert endorsement + rising profile)
- AOC: 9% (consistent progressive support)

**Tier 3 (Combined ~15%):**
- Whitmer: 4%
- Beshear: 3%
- Wes Moore: 2%
- Mark Kelly: 2%
- Others: 1-2% each for viable politicians

**Tier 4 (Combined ~5%):**
- Long shots, non-politicians, extremely unlikely: <1% each

# Checklist

1. **Paraphrase:** Predict which individual will win and accept the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, to be determined by July/August 2028.
   - ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria

2. **Base rate:** Outside view had Newsom 24%, Harris 18%, Shapiro 14%, Buttigieg 11%, Pritzker 8%
   - ✓ Final prediction maintains similar structure but adjusts for current polling showing Harris ahead

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Harris/Newsom (combined 46%); Least likely = non-politicians, ineligible candidates (<0.5% each)
   - ✓ Makes sense given current polling and structural factors

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - February 2026 polls show Harris leading Newsom by 6 points average
   - Polymarket shows Newsom at 32% vs Harris 6% (market-poll divergence)
   - Carville (expert) endorses Pritzker, dismisses Harris
   - AOC consistently polling 8-12% with clear progressive lane
   - Newsom has largest PAC ($4M) and California donor base

5. **Blind spot:** If Harris definitively announces she's NOT running in next 3 months, would dramatically shift probabilities (Newsom to 35%, Shapiro to 15%, Pritzker to 13%, AOC to 12%). Also, 2026 midterm results could elevate/diminish governors significantly.

6. **Technicalities:** ✓ All probabilities 0-100, sum to 100, no % signs
