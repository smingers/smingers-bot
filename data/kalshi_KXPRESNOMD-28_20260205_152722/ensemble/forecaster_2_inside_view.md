## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
1. **Polling convergence (Feb 2026):** Multiple recent polls show Harris and Newsom as clear frontrunners:
   - YouGov: Harris 23%, Newsom 19%
   - Harvard-Harris: Harris 39%, Newsom 30%
   - Big Data: Harris 31%, Newsom 20%
   - RCP average: Harris +6
   
   **Assessment:** This is the strongest evidence. Multiple independent polls from Jan-Feb 2026 consistently show Harris leading Newsom, with both far ahead of other candidates.

2. **Demographic strengths/weaknesses:** Harris leads significantly with Black voters (32% to 15% in YouGov) and younger voters, while Newsom leads with older voters and white voters. Black voters are crucial in Democratic primaries.

3. **Structural factors:** 
   - Time until resolution: ~33 months (Feb 2026 to Nov 2028)
   - Early primary calendar still being determined (12 states competing)
   - No incumbent or VP running (first since 1988)

### Moderate Evidence:
1. **Prediction markets:** Polymarket shows Newsom at 32% vs Harris at 6%, directly contradicting polls. Markets may reflect different information (fundraising, elite support, media narrative) but have been wrong before.

2. **Expert opinion (Carville):** Single high-profile strategist endorses Pritzker, dismisses Harris. However, this contradicts polling data and represents one opinion.

3. **Tier 2 candidates:** AOC (8-12%), Buttigieg (5-10%), Pritzker (7-9%), Shapiro (5-6%) show consistent second-tier support across sources.

4. **Fundraising/infrastructure:** Newsom's PAC has $3.9M, demonstrated ability to raise $114M for redistricting. Pritzker has personal wealth. Harris establishing super PAC.

### Weak Evidence:
1. **Early state positioning:** Various candidates campaigning in early states, but primary calendar not yet set.

2. **Celebrity/non-politician candidates:** Jon Stewart (2% in markets), Michelle Obama, etc. have minimal serious support.

3. **Historical precedent:** Harris would be first nominee to lose nomination after losing general election since Adlai Stevenson (1956). However, circumstances differ significantly.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe:** 33 months until resolution (Feb 2026 to Nov 2028 when nominee is determined, likely by summer 2028 convention).

**If halved (16-17 months):** Would dramatically increase probability of current frontrunners (Harris, Newsom) as less time for field dynamics to shift. Reduce probability of dark horses.

**If doubled (66 months):** Would significantly increase uncertainty and probability of currently unknown or second-tier candidates emerging. Historical example: Obama was not a frontrunner 66 months before 2008 nomination.

**Current assessment:** 33 months is substantial time, but not enough to completely discount current polling. Comparison:
- 33 months before 2008 nomination (Jan 2005): Hillary Clinton was frontrunner but Obama emerged
- 33 months before 2020 nomination (Jan 2017): Biden wasn't running yet
- However, in both cases, the eventual nominee was a known national figure

## (d) Justification and Calibration

### Key Factors Shifting from Base Rate:

**Outside view base rate:** Without specific historical reference class established, I'll use general principles:
- Frontrunners 2-3 years out often win but not always
- Wide-open primaries (no incumbent/VP) are more volatile
- Polling this far out has moderate predictive value
- Black voter support is crucial in Democratic primaries

### Inside View Adjustments:

**Strong upward adjustments:**
1. **Kamala Harris:** Recent polling shows consistent lead (6-16 points over Newsom). Despite concerns about her 2024 loss, she maintains strong support with key Democratic constituencies (Black voters, younger voters). Carville's dismissal contradicts data. **Adjustment: Major upward from base rate**

2. **Gavin Newsom:** Consistently second in polls, leads prediction markets, strong fundraising, high name recognition. California governance concerns may be overstated by partisan sources. **Adjustment: Major upward from base rate**

**Moderate upward adjustments:**
3. **AOC:** Consistently 8-12% in polls, clear progressive lane with Sanders (84) not running. However, concerns about electability and party elite opposition. **Adjustment: Moderate upward**

4. **Pete Buttigieg:** Consistent 5-10% support, Biden administration veteran, strong communicator. Concerns about Black voter support and being gay remain. **Adjustment: Moderate upward**

5. **J.B. Pritzker:** 7-9% in polls, Carville endorsement, personal wealth, strong anti-Trump record. Less name recognition nationally. **Adjustment: Moderate upward**

6. **Josh Shapiro:** 5-6% support, swing-state governor, could appeal to moderates. Less national profile. **Adjustment: Small-moderate upward**

**Small upward adjustments:**
7-10. **Andy Beshear, Gretchen Whitmer, Wes Moore, Mark Kelly:** All mentioned as potential contenders in multiple sources, some early state activity, but minimal polling support currently. **Adjustment: Small upward**

**Minimal/no adjustment:**
- Celebrity candidates (Jon Stewart, Stephen A. Smith, LeBron James, Dwayne Johnson): No serious evidence of candidacy
- Impossible candidates (Barack Obama - constitutionally barred, Hunter Biden - no political viability)
- Past candidates unlikely to run again (Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders too old)
- Tim Walz explicitly withdrew from politics per sources

### Reconciling Polls vs. Prediction Markets:

The stark divergence (Harris leads polls by 6-16 points but Newsom leads markets 32% to 6%) requires explanation:
1. **Markets may reflect elite/donor sentiment** rather than voter preferences
2. **Markets may be betting on electability** in general election, not primary
3. **Polls may be more accurate** for measuring current Democratic voter preferences
4. **Both could be wrong** - field is wide open

Given this is about the Democratic **nominee** (determined by Democratic voters in primaries), I weight polls more heavily than prediction markets.

### Probability Calibration:

**Top Tier (60-65% combined):**
- Harris: Recent polling lead, strong Black voter support, name recognition. Despite 2024 loss concerns, data shows continued support. **28%**
- Newsom: Consistent second place, prediction market leader, strong fundraising, aggressive Trump opposition. **25%**

**Second Tier (25-30% combined):**
- AOC: Clear progressive lane, consistent 8-12% support. Concerns about party elite opposition. **10%**
- Buttigieg: Veteran communicator, 5-10% support. Concerns about demographic weaknesses. **7%**
- Pritzker: Carville endorsement, personal wealth, 7-9% polling. Lower name recognition. **6%**
- Shapiro: Swing-state governor, moderate appeal, 5-6% support. **5%**

**Third Tier (8-10% combined):**
- Whitmer, Beshear, Moore, Kelly: Mentioned frequently, some activity, minimal current polling. **2% each = 8%**

**Long shots (remaining ~5%):**
- Remaining credible politicians split remaining probability
- Celebrity/impossible candidates: minimal probability

### Blind Spots and Confidence Adjustment:

**Potential blind spots:**
1. **Unexpected candidate emergence:** Someone not currently on radar (like Obama in 2005-2006)
2. **Major scandal or health issue** affecting frontrunner
3. **Dramatic shift in political environment** (economic crisis, major policy success/failure)
4. **Underestimating party elite influence** in stopping certain candidates
5. **2026 midterm results** could dramatically reshape field

**Confidence level:** Given 33-month timeframe and wide-open field, I should maintain meaningful probability (20-25%) in "field" beyond top 2-3 candidates. The top two (Harris, Newsom) should not exceed 60% combined.

**Adjustment:** Slightly reduce Harris and Newsom to ensure adequate probability mass in second/third tier and unexpected scenarios.

## Probability Calibration

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Democratic Party nominee for 2028 presidential election, determined by primary/convention process by summer 2028.

2. **Base rate:** Wide-open primary (no incumbent/VP) with 2-3 year polling having moderate predictive value. Adjusted heavily based on current polling convergence.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Harris (26%), Newsom (24%); Least likely = Obama (0.03%), Hunter Biden (0.02%). Makes sense given polling data and constitutional/viability constraints.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Multiple Jan-Feb 2026 polls show Harris leading Newsom by 6-16 points
   - Harris strong with Black voters (32% vs 15%), crucial Democratic constituency
   - Newsom leads prediction markets 32% but trails in voter polls
   - AOC/Buttigieg/Pritzker/Shapiro consistently 5-12% across sources
   - 33 months to resolution allows for field evolution

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected candidate emergence (like Obama 2006-2008) or major scandal/health issue affecting frontrunner. If this occurs, probability would shift to second-tier candidates (Shapiro, AOC, Pritzker, Buttigieg).

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
