Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

1. **Ballotpedia (February 2026)**: High-quality, factual source. Lists 37 potential Democratic candidates based on media speculation. Key fact: No noteworthy campaign announcements as of February 2026, which is historically normal at this stage.

2. **YouGov Poll (September 2025)**: Credible polling organization with proper methodology (n=1,114, ~4% MOE). Shows Newsom (55% would consider, 23% ideal) and Harris (54% would consider, 19% ideal) leading. Notable that Newsom's support increased 24 points from April to September 2025. This is factual polling data, not opinion.

3. **MassLive/James Carville (January 2026)**: Expert opinion from a prominent Democratic strategist. Carville states Harris has "no chance" (opinion) and identifies Pritzker as "the Democrat worth watching" (opinion). He emphasizes fundraising ability and winning Black voters as key criteria. While expert opinion carries weight, it's still subjective.

4. **NY Post/Echelon Insights Poll (July 2025)**: Shows Harris at 26%, Buttigieg 11%, Newsom 10%. Without Harris: Buttigieg and Newsom tied at 12%. Older data (7 months old) but useful for trend analysis.

5. **Agent Report (February 2026)**: Comprehensive synthesis of public statements and fundraising. Key facts: Harris explicitly stated she's "possibly" running (BBC, Oct 2025); Newsom "no longer hiding his ambition" (CalMatters, Sep 2025); Whitmer elected DGA vice-chair. Newsom has ~$4M in federal PAC, Shapiro has $30.2M in state account. No formal exploratory committees filed yet, which is historically normal.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

Possible reference classes:
1. **All Democratic primary winners (1972-2024)**: Too broad, includes vastly different political eras
2. **Post-defeat comeback attempts**: Relevant for Harris specifically
3. **Democratic primaries after losing general election (2004, 2020)**: Most relevant
4. **Early polling leaders 2+ years before primary**: Moderately relevant but historically noisy

**Most suitable**: Democratic primaries after losing the general election, specifically 2004 (after Gore's 2000 loss) and 2020 (after Clinton's 2016 loss). In both cases, the field was wide open with no clear establishment favorite initially.

Historical pattern: In 2004, early leader Howard Dean was overtaken by John Kerry. In 2020, early polling showed Biden leading, but the race was fluid with Sanders, Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg all competitive at various points. Biden ultimately won but wasn't inevitable.

Key insight: Early frontrunners don't always win, especially when there's no incumbent advantage. The candidate who best consolidates support after early contests typically prevails.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

Current date: February 5, 2026
Democratic nomination: Expected July-August 2028 (convention)
Timeframe: ~29-30 months until nomination

Historical comparison at similar timeframe (30 months before nomination):
- **2020 cycle (Sep 2017)**: Biden hadn't announced; Harris, Booker, Warren were exploring
- **2016 cycle (Jan 2014)**: Clinton was clear frontrunner in polls but hadn't announced
- **2008 cycle (Jan 2006)**: Obama hadn't entered national conversation; Clinton led early polls
- **2004 cycle (Jan 2002)**: Kerry, Edwards, Dean all relatively unknown nationally

Pattern: At 30 months out, early polling leaders often win (Clinton 2016, Biden 2020) but major shifts remain possible. Candidates typically announce 12-18 months before Iowa.

(d) **Justification:**

The outside view suggests a relatively concentrated probability distribution among 5-7 serious contenders, with a long tail of unlikely options.

**Top tier (combined ~70-75%):**
- **Newsom**: Leading in most recent polling, largest federal fundraising operation, explicitly positioning for 2028, governor of largest blue state with donor network
- **Harris**: Former VP, explicit interest, name recognition, but Carville's "no chance" assessment and declining polling trend are concerning
- **Shapiro**: Largest war chest ($30M), swing-state governor, strong early positioning but less national profile
- **Whitmer**: DGA vice-chair, strong governor record, swing-state appeal, but lower polling

**Second tier (combined ~15-20%):**
- **Buttigieg**: Strong early polling, national profile, but fundraising unclear
- **Pritzker**: Carville's endorsement, significant personal wealth, but lower polling
- **Beshear**: Red-state Democratic governor success story

**Long shots (combined ~5-10%):**
- AOC, Walz, Kelly, Ossoff, and others: Possible but currently lack infrastructure/positioning

**Essentially impossible (<1% each):**
- Barack Obama (constitutionally ineligible), Hunter Biden (no political experience, baggage), LeBron James, Dwayne Johnson, Jamie Dimon (non-politicians with no indication of interest), Bernie Sanders (will be 87)

Outside view calibration:

(a) **True probability vs. hedging**: I need to avoid overconfidence. While Newsom and Harris lead current indicators, the 30-month timeframe allows for significant shifts. Historical upset rate in Democratic primaries is moderate—frontrunners win more often than not, but dark horses emerge (Carter 1976, Obama 2008).

(b) **Previously established distributions**: The YouGov poll provides a reasonable baseline, but I should adjust for:
- Time decay (September 2025 data is 5 months old)
- Difference between "would consider" and actual nomination
- Expert assessments (Carville's skepticism of Harris)
- Structural advantages (fundraising, organization)

(c) **Probability significance**: The difference between 25% and 20% is meaningful—it's the difference between 3:1 and 4:1 odds. I should be precise.

(d) **Upset rate**: Democratic primaries since 2000 show ~30-40% upset rate where the early leader doesn't win. This suggests I should spread probability more than current polling indicates, but not uniformly.

**Calibration approach**:
- Concentrate 70% among top 4 candidates (Newsom, Harris, Shapiro, Whitmer)
- Allocate 20% to second tier (Buttigieg, Pritzker, Beshear, others with plausible paths)
- Reserve 10% for true dark horses and unexpected entrants
- Assign near-zero to constitutionally ineligible or clearly non-serious candidates
