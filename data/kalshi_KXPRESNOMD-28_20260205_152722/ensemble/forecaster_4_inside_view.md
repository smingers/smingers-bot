Analysis
(a) Source analysis (abridged)

1. Polymarket snapshot (Jan-26). Crowd-sourced prices, updated daily. Factual: current rankings (Newsom 32 %, AOC 8 %, etc.). Reliability: moderate—useful wisdom-of-crowds, but thin information value this far out.  
2. Nate Silver newsletter (20-Jan-26). Credible analyst; combines polling, markets, factional analysis. Facts: Newsom polling lead/tie, AOC lane clear, Buttigieg 3rd. Reliability: strong.  
3. Harvard-Harris poll (field 28-29 Jan-26). Methodology published; N=2,000. Facts: Harris 39 %, Newsom 30 %, AOC 12 %, Pritzker 9 %. Reliability: moderate (online opt-in).  
4. OpenSecrets (06-Jan-26). Hard money totals; Newsom PAC $3.9 M, etc. Reliability: strong.  
5. NBC & CNN mid-’25 articles. Early-state visits by Whitmer, Moore, Buttigieg, Beshear, Shapiro. Reliability: strong for factual travel schedules.  
6. The Hill op-ed (05-Feb-26). Mainly opinion; cites a YouGov aggregate showing Harris +6. Reliability: facts about poll numbers only.  
7. James Carville interviews (Feb-26). Expert opinion; tips Pritzker. Reliability: moderate—one insider’s view.  
8. Misc. partisan/foreign pieces (RedState, Epoch Times, Report.az). Mostly commentary; treat as low-weight except when corroborating polls already cited.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong  
• Structural: Since 1972, in an open Democratic race the nominee has always been a governor, senator, or VP with national name-ID and at least $30 M by mid-primary year (historical hit-rate 100 %).  
• Historic: VPs/early polling leaders win 3/4 of open-seat primaries (Gore 2000, Clinton 2016; exception Obama 2008).  
• Institutional: California governor term-limited in Jan-27; can devote full time/fundraising.  
Moderate  
• Current polling: Harris leads most national polls; Newsom leads most prediction markets.  
• Fundraising: Newsom & Pritzker already building large war chests; Harris launching super-PAC.  
• Factions: Progressive lane appears open (AOC).  
Weak  
• 2025/26 travel to early states—good optics but historically weak predictor this early.  
• Media “buzz” pieces or celebrity speculation.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Decision due July–Aug 2028 (≈ 30 months). If we were 15 months out I would spread probability more thinly (greater chance of surprise). If doubled (60 months) I would lean even more on base rates and give Harris > Newsom.

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustments

Base rate (open Democratic field, modern era):  
• Sitting/former VP 40 %  
• Large-state governor 30 %  
• Sitting senator 15 %  
• Other governor/House/celebrity 15 %

Adjustments:

1. Harris handicaps: historical precedent of losing nominees being renominated is poor (Adlai Stevenson only). Dem elites worry about electability after 2024 loss. Deduct 12  pts.  
2. Newsom tailwinds: clear fundraising edge, ubiquitous media presence, high favorability among party activists, no incumbency duties after 2027. Add 12 pts.  
3. Progressive lane (AOC) factored up because Sanders almost certainly out; polling double-digits already.  
4. Shapiro & Pritzker: strong records in swing/industrial states and insider enthusiasm (Carville, donors). Boost modestly.  
5. Crowd-market wisdom used as secondary calibration.

Blind-spot: A health scandal or campaign implosion eliminating both Harris and Newsom; could open lane for consensus Midwestern or Southern governor (Whitmer, Beshear, Moore). I hedge 14 % across those names plus long-tails.

Probability calibration
The numbers below sum to 100 and express my current belief. I expect to revisit quarterly; largest single-candidate swing I’d anticipate in next 12 months is ±8 pts.

Checklist (short)  
1. Option = which person formally wins and accepts 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. Convention expected July/Aug 2028.  
2. Outside distribution above; final still anchored.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Newsom; least likely = celebrity/business names; matches evidence.  
4. Key evidence: a) Harris leads polls but is damaged 2024 loser. b) Newsom money + media. c) VPs usually win but not after GE loss. d) Prediction markets strongly favor Newsom.  
5. Blind-spot: simultaneous Newsom/Harris flame-outs.  
6. Probabilities 0-100, sum 100.
