Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, ≥ Feb-2026 unless noted)

1. Polymarket snapshot (undated, but prices roll forward). Crowd-sourced probabilities; high liquidity, weak on fundamentals. Mostly facts (price, volume).  
2. OpenSecrets 6 Jan 2026. Describes leadership-PAC cash and Sept-2025 Yahoo/YouGov poll. Facts are FEC-verifiable; interpretation is mild opinion.  
3. Nate Silver blog 20 Jan 2026. Informed pundit opinion; factual bits (poll ranks, factions) accurate, but analysis is opinion.  
4. NYT 18 Jan 2026. Calendar jockeying for early states; purely factual.  
5. NBC 20 Oct 2025. Anecdotal trail activity; reliable but older.  
6. The Hill op-ed 5 Feb 2026. Cites multiple January polling series—factual. Tone is opinionated; numbers are usable.  
7. Harvard/Harris poll 1 Feb 2026 (Epoch Times summary). Large n=2 000, national RV; reputable fieldhouse. Hard number.  
8. RealClearPolitics 4 Feb 2026. Analysis of EV shifts; tangential.  
9. James Carville interviews 2–3 Feb 2026 (Mediaite, ET). Expert opinion; anecdotal.  
10. CNN 20 Dec 2025 & related duplicates. Broad scene-setter, mixture of fact & punditry.  
Overall: strong factual evidence = polling (Harvard/Harris, YouGov), money (FEC/OpenSecrets), structural calendar (NYT). Moderate evidence = Polymarket prices, Carville, Nate Silver. Weak = partisan op-eds.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong  
• Historical base-rate: in the eight modern “open” Democratic cycles, 37 % nominees were current/former VPs, 37 % governors, 25 % senators.  
• Renominating a defeated nominee is 0 / 7 since 1956.  
Moderate  
• Harvard/Harris (Jan 28-29 ’26): Harris 39, Newsom 30, AOC 12, Pritzker 9 among Democrats.  
• YouGov (Sept ’25): Newsom 21 > Harris 19 > AOC ≈ Buttigieg 10.  
• Leadership-PAC/FEC cash: Newsom ~$4 m federal + $37 m state, Pritzker unlimited self-funding, Harris forming Super-PAC.  
• Polymarket 5 Feb ’26: Newsom 32 %, AOC 8 %, Shapiro/Harris ~6 %.  
Weak  
• Carville backing Pritzker; partisan articles; anecdotal campaigning.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Convention ≈ Summer 2028 → ~900 days. Invisible-primary phase normally lasts another 12-18 mo. If horizon were halved (mid-2027) early money/polls would matter more—would nudge Harris up, Newsom/Pritzker down slightly. If doubled (2030) historical reversion would matter—penalise early polling, benefit governors other than Newsom, raise “none-of-the-above”.

(d) Justification of adjustments  
• Polling edge for Harris is real but narrow and almost entirely name-ID driven; historical precedent strongly penalises defeated nominees → raise her, but not to parity with Newsom.  
• Newsom combines largest cash war-chest, clear intent, favourable media coverage, and top market price → boost from 25 → 27.  
• Josh Shapiro: swing-state governor, able fundraiser, no national negatives → keep high single-digits.  
• Whitmer’s DGA chairmanship and Midwest path justify lift to 7 despite flat polls.  
• Pritzker: self-funding + some elite chatter → slight rise to 8.  
• Harvard/Harris solidifies AOC’s progressive lane but coalition ceiling obvious → 5.  
• Other governors (Beshear, Moore, Polis, Walz) and diverse senators (Warnock, Booker, Kelly) each retain small but non-trivial chances.  
• Celebrities/ex-presidents lack structural path; token 0.1–0.5.

Probability calibration  
I widened the lead pair (Newsom, Harris) but kept combined share ≈ 42 % to allow for significant uncertainty. Second tier (Shapiro, Pritzker, Whitmer, Buttigieg, AOC) totals 34 %. Long-tail 24 %. A ±10 % re-allocation between the top two would require decisive movement in early-state polling or major fundraising news—plausible within six months.

Checklist (abridged)  
1. Exactly one listed candidate who accepts 2028 Dem presidential nomination will resolve YES.  
2. Base-rate distribution: VP 37, Gov 37, Sen 25 → adapted above.  
3. Most likely = Newsom; least = many celebrities; consistent with evidence.  
4. Key evidence: a) modern base-rate of governors, b) 0 % precedent for retrying loser, c) Harris 39 % / Newsom 30 % Harvard-Harris, d) Newsom money advantage, e) Polymarket 32 % Newsom lead.  
5. Blind-spot: a fresh face (e.g., Wes Moore or Warnock) vaults after 2026 midterms; mitigated by leaving 24 % long-tail.  
6. Probabilities 0-100, sum = 100.
