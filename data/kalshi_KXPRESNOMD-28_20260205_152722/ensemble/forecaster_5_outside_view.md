Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
1. Ballotpedia snapshot (Feb 2026).  Factual, encyclopedia-style.  Reliable for “who has / has not declared”; no opinions.  
2. YouGov poll (fielded 5–8 Sept 2025, n=1,114; MOE ≈ ±4%).  Methodologically transparent; reputable pollster.  Provides early rank-order of activist-level name recognition and “would consider” sentiment.  
3. NY Post story on Echelon Insights poll (July 2025).  The underlying pollster is respectable; the Post headline is sensational but the numbers are usable.  
4. MassLive story quoting James Carville (Jan 2026).  Direct quotes from a veteran Democratic strategist—valuable as informed opinion, but still opinion.  
5. Agent report (Feb 2026).  Collates FEC filings, money in leadership PACs, public statements, DGA position, etc.; cites primary sources (FEC, OpenSecrets, Detroit Free Press, BBC, CNN).  Useful factual aggregation; any analytic color is noted as opinion.

(b)  Reference-class analysis  
Shortlist:  
• “Open Democratic nomination” cycles since 1972 (’76, ’88, ’92, ’00, ’04, ’08, ’16, ’20, ’28) → 8 cases.  
• “Major-party nominees who previously lost a general election” since 1950.  
• “Role held immediately before winning nomination” for modern Democratic nominees.  
Most germane: the first class (“open Democratic nomination” cycles).  It tells us the kinds of people who emerge when there is no sitting Democratic president.

Observed outcomes in that reference class (n=8):  
– Sitting/former VP : 3 (Mondale ’84, Gore ’00, Biden ’20) → 37%  
– Sitting governor : 3 (Carter ’76, Dukakis ’88, Clinton ’92) → 37%  
– Sitting U.S. Senator : 2 (Kerry ’04, Obama ’08) → 25%  
No one has been renominated after losing the prior general election since Adlai Stevenson in 1956 (outside our reference class).

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
Roughly 30 months (≈900 days) until the Democratic convention summer 2028.  Historically, first exploratory committees appear 9-14 months before Iowa; polling winners 2½ years out rarely go wire-to-wire (McGovern ’72 the lone example).  Large early money and elite endorsements do correlate moderately with eventual success, but the invisible primary is still gathering steam in early 2026.

(d)  Justification of outside view  
1. Base-rate anchor: 37% governor, 25% senator, 37% (ex-)VP.  
2. Discount factor for “defeated nominees”: Democrats have awarded a second nomination 0% of the time in the last 70 years.  Therefore Kamala Harris starts well below the 37% VP base-rate.  
3. Governors with obvious national profiles, large donor networks, and no disqualifying baggage (Newsom, Whitmer, Shapiro, Pritzker) inherit most of the gubernatorial base-rate.  
4. Senators enjoy a smaller base-rate; none right now stands out as Obama-style phenomenon.  I spread the 25% mainly across Warnock, Kelly, Booker, Sanders et al., each at low single digits.  
5. Polls: YouGov shows Newsom and Harris essentially tied in “would consider,” but Newsom is rising sharply while Harris is sliding.  Echelon shows Harris narrowly first in name-ID but Newsom competitive.  Early polling thus nudges Newsom upward, Harris downward.  
6. Money & signals: Leadership-PAC cash (Newsom ≈ $4 m federal; Shapiro $30 m state; Pritzker self-funding ability), plus explicit interest (Harris, Newsom) and national roles (Whitmer at DGA) further sharpen the spread.  
7. Long-shot celebrities, ex-presidents, or Republicans (Obama, Liz Cheney, LeBron, etc.) are given ~0–1% total because neither precedent nor party rules make them realistic.  
8. Because the market restricts resolution to the listed 39 names, the “someone else” probability must be redistributed proportionally to those on the list; I allocate most of that residual to the highest-plausibility tier rather than thinly across implausible names.

Outside view calibration:

• Historical upset rate: in six of the eight modern open contests, the nominee was in the top-five of party insiders’ “shadow primary” lists two years out.  True black-swans (e.g., Carter ’76, Obama ’08) happen roughly 25% of the time.  I allocate ~25 percentage points collectively to lesser-known or currently low-polling names.  
• Market prices: No liquid 2026 futures yet, so no strong anchoring signal to override the historical priors.  
• The resulting distribution keeps 75 % on eight leading contenders, 25 % on the remaining 31 names, and sums to 100 %.
