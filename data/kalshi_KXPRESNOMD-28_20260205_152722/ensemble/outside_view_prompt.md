**Author:** Advance Local Express Desk

## Key Points:

### Named Source Opinion:
**James Carville (Democratic strategist)** provided insights on potential 2028 Democratic presidential nominees during an interview with Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo:

- **Kamala Harris:** Carville stated Harris has "no chance" of winning the presidency in 2028 if she decides to run
- **JB Pritzker (Illinois Governor):** Identified as "the Democrat worth watching for the next nomination." Carville said he would "take" Pritzker if he were "betting the Kentucky Derby," noting "He campaigns hard"
- **Other potential candidates mentioned:** Governors Gavin Newsom (California) and Josh Shapiro (Pennsylvania) were noted as possessing necessary donor networks as leaders of big states

### Carville's Criteria for Nominees:
Two "really important questions" potential nominees must answer:
1. Ability to raise significant early funding
2. Ability to win over Black voters

### Additional Context:
- Pritzker has recently sparred with President Donald Trump over the Insurrection Act and Texas National Guard deployment to Chicago, filing a lawsuit on Oct. 6, 2025
- Early polling from Emerson College suggests Harris may be losing her initial edge
- Carville stated Democrats don't want to revisit the 2024 loss, saying of Harris and Biden: "Not that we dislike them...This is not what we're doing"
- Carville predicted the Democratic base prioritizes victory over demographic representation: "If we nominate two white males, no one's going to give a (expletive)"
- "Politics is not about being pure...It's not about having a rooted ideology. It's about winning, and winning is its own cause"

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Summarize current endorsements, fundraising, exploratory committees for potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidates; highlight any public statements by Biden, Harris, Whitmer, Newsom, Shapiro, Buttigieg since Jan 2025; compare with historical primary timelines 2004-2020
Below is a February 2026 status report on the still-nascent 2028 Democratic presidential field that incorporates every datapoint contained in the new search set.

1.  Exploratory committees  
•  The Federal Election Commission’s public database continues to show zero Statements of Candidacy (Form 2) or “testing-the-waters” committees for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro or Pete Buttigieg. Nothing in the new material alters that finding; the only 2028-cycle filing on record remains the routine “2028 Democratic National Convention Committee.” (FEC.gov, browse page).  
•  Taken together with the 2004-2020 historical record (first filings typically appear 9-14 months before Iowa/New Hampshire), the absence of 2028 paperwork in early 2026 remains normal.

2.  Fundraising infrastructure  
No formal presidential committees exist yet, but leadership PACs, super-PACs and state accounts are providing the first monetary clues.

•  Gavin Newsom – His federal leadership PAC “Campaign for Democracy” was already sitting on roughly $4 million as of January 2026; no newer figure surfaced, but nothing contradicts that cash-lead status (prior OpenSecrets data).  
•  Kamala Harris – The super-PAC “Fight for the People” still has not posted a 2025 year-end report, so her hard number is still missing. However, Harris’s book tour (see Section 4) is being financed through the same political network.  
•  Gretchen Whitmer – Her state-level “Fight Like Hell PAC” “raised millions in the 2024 cycle,” according to the Detroit Free Press (8 Dec 2025) and OpenSecrets’ hybrid-PAC profile (OpenSecrets summary, 2024). But the federal Form 3X covering 2025 is still not online, so exact receipts and cash-on-hand remain unknown.  
•  Josh Shapiro – Pennsylvania’s campaign-finance portal still lists $30.2 million in his gubernatorial account at 2025 year-end (previous round).  
•  Pete Buttigieg – His “Win the Era” PAC continues national e-mail solicitations; 2025 figures are still not posted.  
•  Joe Biden – No 2028-related entity discovered.

Bottom line: Newsom keeps the largest disclosed federal pile; Shapiro keeps the largest overall piggy-bank; precise 2025 numbers for Harris, Whitmer and Buttigieg are still the largest data holes.

3.  Endorsements  
The search results reveal no formal endorsements by incumbent or former Democratic elected officials for any 2028 aspirant. The field therefore remains endorsement-free as of February 2026.

4.  Public statements and positioning since 1 Jan 2025  
The new clips deepen—but do not fundamentally change—the portrait of each contender.

•  Kamala Harris  
   – 31 Jul 2025, CBS: “Leaving every option on the table.” (prior round)  
   – 25 Oct 2025, BBC: “I am not done… possibly” when asked if she would seek the presidency again (BBC, 25 Oct 2025).  
   – 19 Sep 2025, CNN advance copy of her memoir “107 Days” shows Harris dissecting potential 2028 rivals and confirming she is weighing another run (CNN, 19 Sep 2025).  
   These on-record remarks make Harris the only potential candidate who has explicitly acknowledged interest.

•  Gavin Newsom  
   – CalMatters column (25 Sep 2025) notes that Newsom is “no longer hiding his ambition” and recaps his anti-Trump media blitz, including a Stephen Colbert appearance calling Democrats’ 2024 losses “our failures.” The article flatly states Newsom “finally admits he’s contemplating a run for president.”  
   Though still no literal “I’m running,” the quote marks his clearest public signal to date.

•  Gretchen Whitmer  
   – Elected Democratic governors unanimously chose Whitmer as vice-chair of the Democratic Governors Association for the 2026 cycle (Detroit Free Press, 8 Dec 2025). The post positions her as a national fundraiser and surrogate but she continues to dodge 2028 questions.

•  Josh Shapiro  
   – No fresh statements beyond his 21 Oct 2025 memoir announcement and September 2025 radio interview (prior round).

•  Pete Buttigieg  
   – No new remarks surfaced, leaving his July 2025 NPR interview Sidestepping direct questions as the latest word.

•  Joe Biden  
   – No additional 2028 comments beyond his May 2025 BBC interview denying interest (prior round).

5.  Comparative timing vs. past primary cycles  
First exploratory/full committees before Iowa/New Hampshire:  
• Kerry 2004: Dec 2002 (-14 mo)  
• Obama/Clinton 2008: Jan 2007 (-11 mo)  
• Clinton 2016: Apr 2015 (-9 mo)  
• Warren/Harris/Buttigieg 2020: Dec 2018–Jan 2019 (-13 to -12 mo)

If Iowa/NH remain early Feb 2028, filings would normally begin Q1–Q2 2027. By that yardstick the absence of 2028 committees in early 2026 is fully in line with precedent, even as PAC fundraising, memoir rollouts and early-state travel appear roughly 9-12 months ahead of past invisible primaries.

6.  Candidate snapshots – February 2026  
• Gavin Newsom – Largest disclosed federal cash; newly explicit interest in 2028; national media omnipresence.  
• Kamala Harris – Only figure openly conceding she’s “possibly” running; super-PAC plus book tour provide both narrative and fundraising scaffolding.  
• Josh Shapiro – Biggest single pot of money ($30 m state); memoir and early-state travel remain his primary signals.  
• Gretchen Whitmer – DGA vice-chair role boosts national profile; awaiting PAC filings to gauge cash.  
• Pete Buttigieg – Active email list and policy media but opaque finances.  
• Joe Biden – Structurally dormant; no sign of comeback bid.

7.  Early-state calendar  
Nine states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, have petitioned the DNC for early-window slots (previous round). A favorable Rules & Bylaws Committee decision—still pending—could materially advantage Whitmer or Shapiro.

8.  What’s new compared with the last report  
• Harris escalated from vague hints to declaring she is “not done” and “possibly” running (BBC).  
• Newsom shed coyness, telling national audiences he is contemplating 2028 (CalMatters).  
• Whitmer assumed a high-visibility national fundraising role (DGA vice-chair).  
No structural changes occurred in filings, endorsements or published fundraising totals.

9.  Remaining information gaps  
a. FEC year-end 2025 receipts & cash-on-hand for Whitmer’s “Fight Like Hell PAC,” Harris’s “Fight for the People,” and Buttigieg’s “Win the Era.”  
b. Any first-tier endorsement by sitting or former Democratic officials.  
c. Definitive DNC ruling on 2028 primary calendar.  
d. Any explicit statement from Joe Biden closing—or reopening—the door to a bid.

Until those numbers and statements surface, the 2028 Democratic race will remain an invisible primary fought mainly through PAC ledgers, memoir tours and cable-news appearances.

(The analysis relies on Detroit Free Press 8 Dec 2025; OpenSecrets Fight Like Hell PAC profile 2024; CNN 19 Sep 2025; BBC 25 Oct 2025; CalMatters 25 Sep 2025; FEC browse page 2026.)

Verification checklist  
1. Analysis correctly formatted.  
2. No “</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
