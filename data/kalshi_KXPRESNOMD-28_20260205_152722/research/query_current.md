The nominee will emerge from a field that is still fluid because President Biden is term-limited, making 2028 the first open Democratic primary in decades. The most relevant current information will discuss which listed politicians are openly preparing (fund-raising, visiting early primary states, staffing up), who is ruling out a run, and how events such as the 2026 midterms or Cabinet reshuffles affect their prospects. We therefore want broad coverage of “2028 Democratic presidential candidates,” plus real-time news on potential contenders and exploratory activity. A comprehensive AskNews query will surface analytical articles about campaign preparations and rankings.
