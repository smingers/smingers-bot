(In 2028)\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Can Newsom troll his way to the Democratic nomination in 2028?**\nThe article examines the emerging 2028 Democratic presidential primary race, focusing on the contest between former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom. Despite Newsom\u2019s media savvy, consistent TV appearances, and strategic online trolling that appeals to left-leaning media elites, polling data from multiple sources\u2014including RealClearPolitics, Harvard-Harris, YouGov, Morning Consult, Big Data, and Rasmussen\u2014shows Harris leading by an average of 6 points. The January YouGov poll found Harris ahead among Democrats 23% to 19% and leading with Black voters (32% to 15%) and younger voters (27% to 10%), while Newsom holds an edge with white voters (19% to 13%) and a significant lead among voters aged 65 and older (30% to 8%). Harris is perceived as more disappointing as a nominee, with 18% of Democrats and 34% of independents expressing disappointment, compared to only 7% for Newsom. She also trails in electability, with 33% of Democrats viewing Newsom as more electable versus 19% for Harris, except among voters aged 30\u201344 and Black voters. The Harvard-Harris poll shows Harris with a 9-point lead (39% to 30%), though it excludes Pete Buttigieg and asks all voters\u2014including Republicans\u2014to pick a nominee. The article notes that both candidates have significant flaws, and while Newsom\u2019s media-driven campaign and trolling tactics have momentum, his age, governance record in California (marked by dysfunction, deficits, and net outmigration), and demographic weaknesses pose challenges. The race remains fluid, with the possibility of other candidates emerging if either Harris or Newsom stumbles. The last competitive multi-way Democratic primary was in 1992, and the last nominee to defeat a prominent national figure was Barack Obama in 2008, who had strong institutional backing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 02:00 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5722972-harris-newsom-2028-democrats/)\n\n**Vance or Rubio? Trump declines to take sides in 2028 successor debate**\nPresident Donald Trump declined to take sides in the 2028 Republican presidential succession debate between his vice president, JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump stated he would be 'inclined' to endorse a successor but emphasized he does not want to engage in the discussion now, noting there are three years until the election. He praised both men as 'fantastic' and of 'very high intelligence,' highlighting their different styles\u2014calling Rubio 'slightly more diplomatic'\u2014and suggested their combination on a ticket would be 'very hard to be beaten.' Vance, a former Ohio senator, has indicated he will discuss a potential run with Trump after the November 2026 midterm elections. Rubio, a former Florida senator who ran for the 2016 Republican nomination, has not ruled out a 2028 run but has publicly endorsed Vance. Trump also re-ignited speculation about a potential third term, saying, 'I don't know. It would be interesting,' when asked if he could still be president in January 2029. The 2028 election is expected to feature wide-open fields on both the Republican and Democratic sides.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 06:13 AM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/united-states/2026/02/05/vance-or-rubio-trump-declines-to-take-sides-in-2028-successor-debate)\n\n**Trump Hints Again at Third Presidential Term and Avoids Choosing Between Vance and Rubio**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump hinted again on Wednesday, February 5, 2026, at the possibility of a third non-constitutional presidential term, reigniting a debate he previously dropped. When asked by NBC News if there could be a scenario where he remains president beyond the 2029 inauguration, Trump responded, 'I don't know. That would be interesting.' He refused to take a stance on whether Ohio Senator J.D. Vance or Florida Senator Marco Rubio would be his preferred successor for the 2028 Republican presidential campaign. Vance, a former Republican senator, said he would discuss his potential candidacy with Trump after the November midterm elections. Meanwhile, sources within the Republican Party speculate that Rubio, who previously ran for president in 2016 and lost to Trump, may also seek the nomination. Rubio has not ruled out a 2028 run but praised Vance as a strong potential candidate. Trump stated he would 'lean toward' supporting a successor but said he doesn't want to engage in conflict, emphasizing both men are doing 'great' work. He described the two as highly intelligent and noted a stylistic difference\u2014'one is a little more diplomatic than the other'\u2014while asserting that a joint ticket of Vance and Rubio would be 'very hard to beat.' The 2028 election is expected to feature a wide-open race with strong competition on both the Republican and Democratic sides.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 05:33 AM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/world/1850999-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD-%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%AF%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D8%A9-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%88)\n\n**Why 2028 May Be Democrats' Last Best Chance**\nAccording to the American Redistricting Project's 2030 census projections, 11 electoral votes and congressional seats will shift: four from California and one each from Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island; four to Texas, two to Florida, and one each to Idaho, Utah, Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. This results in Democratic states losing nine electoral votes and Republican states gaining nine, reducing Democrats\u2019 projected 2024 electoral vote total from 226 to 217. In 2028, Democrats must win 44 of 93 electoral votes from seven swing states to reach 270. By 2032, with nine additional electoral votes shifting to Republican-leaning states, Democrats would need 53 electoral votes from the same seven swing states\u2014effectively requiring them to win another swing state, equivalent to Wisconsin\u2019s projected electoral vote. The article also argues that Democrats\u2019 anti-Trump messaging, central since 2016, will be outdated by 2032 when Trump is no longer on the ballot. Without a positive, forward-looking platform, Democrats face a leadership vacuum: Joe Biden has exited the race, Kamala Harris is supported by only 21.3% of Democrats in 2028 nomination polling, and Tim Walz has withdrawn from politics. The article concludes that 2028 is Democrats\u2019 last viable chance to win the presidency, rebuild their message, and create a credible record\u2014before the electoral and strategic landscape becomes even more unfavorable.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 12:15 PM\nSource:[Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2026/02/04/why_2028_may_be_democrats_last_best_chance_153791.html)\n\n**Harvard/Harris Poll Reveals Top 2028 Presidential Contenders Amid Political Divisions**\nAccording to the Harvard/Harris Poll released on February 1, 2026, J.D.

Twelve states\u2014Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia\u2014were all granted approval to present their waiver requests for early contests ahead of Super Tuesday. The RBC will evaluate states based on the rigor, efficiency, and fairness of their nominating processes, with the goal of selecting a calendar that produces the strongest possible Democratic nominee. Under DNC bylaws, only one state from each of four regions (Eastern, Western, Southern, Midwestern) may hold an early contest, plus one additional waiver. Iowa is competing with Michigan and Illinois for the Midwestern early slot. Iowa\u2019s application, submitted January 16, emphasized its historical role in providing opportunities for underdog presidential candidates, citing its infrastructure and experience. The state highlighted reforms such as the 2024 mail-in caucus system and proposed options including satellite and virtual caucuses to improve accessibility for voters with disabilities, childcare responsibilities, or late work shifts. However, RBC members Michael Kapp and Frank Leone questioned the lack of a specific proposal, urging Iowa to present a clear plan rather than a 'menu' of options. Concerns were raised about the open, undefined universe of participants in caucuses versus the closed, known universe of convention voters. The committee has not yet set dates for Iowa\u2019s presentation or the final decision, with the next RBC meeting scheduled for April in New Orleans. The Iowa Democratic Party expressed disappointment that the DNC previously excluded them from the early calendar, stating it allowed Republican attacks to go unanswered while enabling massive Republican advertising and media attention in Iowa.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 07:36 AM\nSource:[georgiarecorder.com](https://georgiarecorder.com/2026/02/02/repub/dnc-will-allow-iowa-democrats-to-compete-for-early-date-for-2028-caucuses/)\n\n**James Carville Reveals Which Democrat He'd Back for President in 2028**\nPolitical strategist James Carville revealed on the show Arroyo Grande that he believes Illinois Governor JB Pritzker is the ideal Democratic candidate for the 2028 U.S. presidential election. Carville outlined two key criteria for a winning Democratic nominee: the ability to raise substantial campaign funds early and the ability to be warmly received in Black communities. While he named California Governor Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Pritzker as top fundraisers, only Pritzker met the second criterion. Carville dismissed former Vice President Kamala Harris, stating she has 'no chance' due to her association with the 2024 election and a lack of enthusiasm among Democrats. He argued that polling showing Harris as a top name is meaningless, as it reflects name recognition rather than genuine support. Carville emphasized Pritzker\u2019s relatability, citing his $1.5 million casino winnings in Las Vegas, and claimed he is involved in Black church building fund committees across South Carolina, stating, 'They like him, man.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:20 PM\nSource:[Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/podcasts/james-carville-reveals-which-democrat-hed-back-for-president-in-2028/)\n\n**WP Names Likely Democratic Candidate for U.S. President in 2028**\nAccording to The Washington Post (WP), California Governor Gavin Newsom is considered a likely candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in the 2028 U.S. elections.

In October 2025, Newsom stated he intends to run for president as a Democrat, adding that he will wait for the results of the 2026 midterm elections before making a final decision and emphasizing that he does not see himself as the only possible Democratic candidate. In December, the Axios portal reported that former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris may also seek the presidency in 2028, with her actions already being viewed by Democratic Party insiders as the beginning of a new presidential campaign.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 06:10 PM\nSource:[Report \u0130nformasiya Agentliyi](https://report.az/ru/drugie-strany/wp-nazvala-veroyatnogo-kandidata-v-prezidenty-ot-demokratov-na-vyborah-v-2028-godu)\n\n**JD Vance Predicts 2028 Democrat Presidential Nominee  --  His Pick Is Hilarious and Spot On**\nIn an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters on January 8, 2026, Vice President JD Vance predicted that the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee would likely be either Kamala Harris or Gavin Newsom, whom he described as the party's two leading but deeply flawed front-runners. Vance criticized Harris for being unqualified, citing her 2024 presidential loss to Donald Trump and her tendency to deflect blame. He labeled Newsom as 'unbelievably corrupt and incompetent,' referencing California's governance and a claimed 'fraud investigation.' Vance argued that the Democratic Party lacks substantive policy platforms, instead focusing obsessively on opposing Donald Trump. When asked who would win between Harris and Newsom, Vance quipped, 'The dumbest candidate will probably win, [is] my guess, with the Democratic Party,' a statement met with laughter. The article, published by RedState.com, frames California as a 'poster child for everything that is wrong with the Democrat Party and the 'progressive' movement,' and attributes the Democratic Party's struggles to decades of misleading voters and a reliance on anti-Trump sentiment over policy. The article's tone is strongly partisan, with Vance portrayed as a calm yet incisive critic of Democratic leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 06:55 PM\nSource:[Redstate](https://redstate.com/mike_miller/2026/01/08/vance-predicts-wholl-win-2020-democrat-nomination-and-why-which-is-both-hilarious-and-spot-on-n2197906)\n\n**Analysis: Democrats are making 2028 moves. Here's what to know**\nDemocrats are actively preparing for the 2028 presidential election, which will occur after Donald Trump is barred from the ballot. Despite a sense of optimism following recent electoral gains and perceived erosion of Trump\u2019s support, the party faces a wide-open primary with no clear frontrunner. The absence of a unifying figure like Kamala Harris\u2014whose potential re-election is uncertain\u2014marks the first time since 1988 that no anchor candidate defines the race. Key figures in the emerging field include California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited and has gained national visibility through his aggressive stance against Trump, including redistricting reforms and public advocacy. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, though not running for governor, is maintaining high visibility through a successful book tour and is likely positioning herself for a 2028 run, though historical precedent\u2014being the first nominee to lose after losing the nomination since Adlai Stevenson in 1956\u2014poses a challenge. Pete Buttigieg, lacking a current platform, is relying on his communication skills and anti-Trump rhetoric to remain relevant. The progressive wing, previously led by Bernie Sanders, may be filled by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), who is constitutionally eligible and has strong support, though her intentions remain ambiguous. Her potential run could fracture the progressive vote, which may also be contested by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a billionaire with a strong anti-Trump record and national influence. Other notable contenders include Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who could appeal to moderate, non-college-educated White voters, and Arizona Senators Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly, who are building national profiles through Latino outreach and public defiance of Trump. Governors like Andy Beshear of Kentucky and lawmakers such as Chris Murphy and Cory Booker are also making early appearances. The 2026 midterm elections will serve as a critical test of momentum, with candidates seeking credit for Democratic gains. While the field may include 6\u201310 major candidates, concerns remain about diversity in the race, with Michelle Obama suggesting the country may not yet be ready for a woman president\u2014though the precedent of Barack Obama\u2019s election counters that view. Overall, the 2028 race is shaping up as a dynamic, high-stakes contest with multiple potential paths to the nomination.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 20, 2025 12:01 PM\nSource:[CNN International](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/20/politics/2028-presidential-election-democrats)\n\n**Democrats are making 2028 moves. Here's what to know**\nDemocrats are actively preparing for the 2028 presidential election, which will occur after Donald Trump is barred from the ballot. While unified in their desire to move past Trump, the party faces a fragmented primary landscape without a clear frontrunner. CNN senior reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere outlines the current state of play, noting that Democrats are less in existential panic following modest 2025 electoral wins and signs of Trump\u2019s declining support. Key potential candidates include California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited and has gained national attention through his aggressive opposition to Trump, including leading efforts to redistrict California and engaging in high-profile media and social media campaigns. Kamala Harris, though not running for governor, is expanding her book tour into 2026 and remains a figure of interest, though her past loss as the 2024 nominee raises concerns about her viability. Pete Buttigieg lacks a current platform and relies solely on communication skills, while Bernie Sanders, now 84, has indicated he will not run again. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is seen as the likely successor to Sanders\u2019 progressive base, with strong support and political influence, though her intentions remain ambiguous. Other contenders include Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who has gained traction through strong anti-Trump rhetoric and leadership on issues like ICE and National Guard deployments; senators Cory Booker and Chris Murphy, who are testing the anti-Trump political waters; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who is building national visibility through his role as chair of the Democratic Governors Association; and Arizona senators Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, who are campaigning to broaden Democratic appeal among Latinos and younger men. The 2026 midterm elections will serve as a critical test for these candidates, offering opportunities to build coalitions and claim credit for Democratic gains. The field is expected to include six to ten significant candidates, with the primary likely to be shaped by performance in early 2027. Despite concerns about gender and identity, Dovere argues that the country may not be ready for a woman or LGBTQ+ candidate today, but will be ready when the right individual emerges. The race is not yet officially underway, but strategic groundwork is already in motion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 20, 2025 12:01 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/democrats-making-2028-moves-know-120100237.html)\n\n**Kamala Harris' 2028 presidential chances get boost**\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is the leading candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, according to a December 2025 poll by Big Data Poll, a Florida-based firm. Harris received 31.1% support, ahead of California Governor Gavin Newsom (20.3%) and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (10%). This surge in momentum comes after Harris announced plans to expand her book tour in 2026 and delivered a message at a Democratic National Committee (DNC) meeting in Los Angeles, urging attendees to develop a 'clear vision for what comes after the midterms and then after Trump.' The statement was met with audience enthusiasm, including a shouted 'You!' from one attendee, as reported by multiple outlets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 15, 2025 10:19 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-2028-presidential-chances-get-boost-11211876)\n\n**Harris, Newsom, and Pritzker Converge at High-Stakes Democratic National Committee Summit Ahead of 2028 Race**\nThree prominent U.S. Democrats\u2014Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and JB Pritzker\u2014are converging at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s (DNC) annual winter meeting in Los Angeles, signaling early preparations for the 2028 presidential nomination race. Although the primary focus of the conference is on analyzing the Democratic Party\u2019s strong 2025 election results and preparing for the 2026 midterm elections, the gathering also serves as a strategic platform for potential 2028 presidential contenders. Harris, who previously ruled out a 2026 gubernatorial run in California, has left her 2028 candidacy open, stating she has 'dedicated her entire professional career to public service.' Newsom confirmed he would be 'seriously' considering a presidential bid after the 2026 midterms, while Pritzker said he 'cannot rule out anything' regarding a White House run. The meeting is seen as a preliminary 'test screen' for these top-tier Democrats, allowing them to build visibility and shape a winning message for 2028. Other potential 2028 candidates include governors Josh Shapiro (Pennsylvania), Andy Beshear (Kentucky), Wes Moore (Maryland), Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan), and senators Cory Booker (New Jersey), Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota), Rub\u00e9n Gallego and Mark Kelly (Arizona), Chris Murphy (Connecticut), representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (New York) and Ro Khanna (California), former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Rahm Emanuel (Chicago). With Democrats aiming to regain control of the House and possibly the Senate in 2026, political activity from 2028 hopefuls is expected to intensify. Ray Buckley, a long-time DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee member, noted that while the immediate focus is on 2026, 'there is interest in 2028,' and these gatherings allow 'all our stars to head to the DNC.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!](https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/2028-avecina-harris-newsom-pritzker-100033056.html)\n\n**2028 looms large: Harris, Newsom, Pritzker converge at high-stakes Democratic Party summit**\nThree prominent Democrats\u2014former Vice President Kamala Harris, Governor Gavin Newsom of California, and Governor JB Pritzker of Illinois\u2014are attending the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) annual winter meeting in Los Angeles, which began on December 12, 2025. The summit\u2019s primary focus is reviewing the party\u2019s strong performance in the 2025 elections and preparing for the 2026 midterms, but the event has also become a strategic stage for potential 2028 presidential contenders. Harris, the 2024 Democratic nominee, has not ruled out a 2028 run, stating in an October BBC interview, 'I am not done... it's in my bones.' Newsom confirmed he is considering a presidential bid after the 2026 midterms, saying, 'Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise.' Pritzker, seeking re-election in Illinois, told NBC News in August, 'I can't rule anything out.' All three have been active in early-voting states: Harris on her book tour, Newsom in South Carolina, and Pritzker in New Hampshire and Nevada. The DNC\u2019s Rules and Bylaws Committee chair, Ray Buckley, noted that while the immediate focus is on 2026, 'there's interest in 2028.' Other potential 2028 candidates include governors Josh Shapiro, Andy Beshear, Wes Moore, and Gretchen Whitmer; senators Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Ruben Gallego, Mark Kelly, and Chris Murphy; representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ro Khanna; former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg; and former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel. Buckley emphasized that these candidates are expected to remain highly engaged in 2026 to help secure House and Senate majorities and strengthen the party\u2019s ballot-line presence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2028-looms-large-harris-newsom-pritzker-converge-high-stakes-democratic-party-summit)\n\n**Surprise candidate emerges as potential 2028 Democratic presidential nominee**\nU.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio\u2011Cortez, D\u2011NY, has emerged as a potential surprise candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, according to CNN data analyst Harry Enten.
