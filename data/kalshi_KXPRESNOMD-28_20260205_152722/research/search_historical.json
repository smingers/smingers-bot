Exploratory committees  \n\u2022  The Federal Election Commission\u2019s public database continues to show zero Statements of Candidacy (Form 2) or \u201ctesting-the-waters\u201d committees for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro or Pete Buttigieg. Nothing in the new material alters that finding; the only 2028-cycle filing on record remains the routine \u201c2028 Democratic National Convention Committee.\u201d (FEC.gov, browse page).  \n\u2022  Taken together with the 2004-2020 historical record (first filings typically appear 9-14 months before Iowa/New Hampshire), the absence of 2028 paperwork in early 2026 remains normal.\n\n2.  Fundraising infrastructure  \nNo formal presidential committees exist yet, but leadership PACs, super-PACs and state accounts are providing the first monetary clues.\n\n\u2022  Gavin Newsom \u2013 His federal leadership PAC \u201cCampaign for Democracy\u201d was already sitting on roughly $4 million as of January 2026; no newer figure surfaced, but nothing contradicts that cash-lead status (prior OpenSecrets data).  \n\u2022  Kamala Harris \u2013 The super-PAC \u201cFight for the People\u201d still has not posted a 2025 year-end report, so her hard number is still missing. However, Harris\u2019s book tour (see Section 4) is being financed through the same political network.  \n\u2022  Gretchen Whitmer \u2013 Her state-level \u201cFight Like Hell PAC\u201d \u201craised millions in the 2024 cycle,\u201d according to the Detroit Free Press (8 Dec 2025) and OpenSecrets\u2019 hybrid-PAC profile (OpenSecrets summary, 2024). But the federal Form 3X covering 2025 is still not online, so exact receipts and cash-on-hand remain unknown.  \n\u2022  Josh Shapiro \u2013 Pennsylvania\u2019s campaign-finance portal still lists $30.2 million in his gubernatorial account at 2025 year-end (previous round).  \n\u2022  Pete Buttigieg \u2013 His \u201cWin the Era\u201d PAC continues national e-mail solicitations; 2025 figures are still not posted.  \n\u2022  Joe Biden \u2013 No 2028-related entity discovered.\n\nBottom line: Newsom keeps the largest disclosed federal pile; Shapiro keeps the largest overall piggy-bank; precise 2025 numbers for Harris, Whitmer and Buttigieg are still the largest data holes.\n\n3.  Endorsements  \nThe search results reveal no formal endorsements by incumbent or former Democratic elected officials for any 2028 aspirant. The field therefore remains endorsement-free as of February 2026.\n\n4.  Public statements and positioning since 1 Jan 2025  \nThe new clips deepen\u2014but do not fundamentally change\u2014the portrait of each contender.\n\n\u2022  Kamala Harris  \n   \u2013 31 Jul 2025, CBS: \u201cLeaving every option on the table.\u201d (prior round)  \n   \u2013 25 Oct 2025, BBC: \u201cI am not done\u2026 possibly\u201d when asked if she would seek the presidency again (BBC, 25 Oct 2025).  \n   \u2013 19 Sep 2025, CNN advance copy of her memoir \u201c107 Days\u201d shows Harris dissecting potential 2028 rivals and confirming she is weighing another run (CNN, 19 Sep 2025).  \n   These on-record remarks make Harris the only potential candidate who has explicitly acknowledged interest.\n\n\u2022  Gavin Newsom  \n   \u2013 CalMatters column (25 Sep 2025) notes that Newsom is \u201cno longer hiding his ambition\u201d and recaps his anti-Trump media blitz, including a Stephen Colbert appearance calling Democrats\u2019 2024 losses \u201cour failures.\u201d The article flatly states Newsom \u201cfinally admits he\u2019s contemplating a run for president.\u201d  \n   Though still no literal \u201cI\u2019m running,\u201d the quote marks his clearest public signal to date.\n\n\u2022  Gretchen Whitmer  \n   \u2013 Elected Democratic governors unanimously chose Whitmer as vice-chair of the Democratic Governors Association for the 2026 cycle (Detroit Free Press, 8 Dec 2025). The post positions her as a national fundraiser and surrogate but she continues to dodge 2028 questions.\n\n\u2022  Josh Shapiro  \n   \u2013 No fresh statements beyond his 21 Oct 2025 memoir announcement and September 2025 radio interview (prior round).\n\n\u2022  Pete Buttigieg  \n   \u2013 No new remarks surfaced, leaving his July 2025 NPR interview Sidestepping direct questions as the latest word.\n\n\u2022  Joe Biden  \n   \u2013 No additional 2028 comments beyond his May 2025 BBC interview denying interest (prior round).\n\n5.  Comparative timing vs. past primary cycles  \nFirst exploratory/full committees before Iowa/New Hampshire:  \n\u2022 Kerry 2004: Dec 2002 (-14 mo)  \n\u2022 Obama/Clinton 2008: Jan 2007 (-11 mo)  \n\u2022 Clinton 2016: Apr 2015 (-9 mo)  \n\u2022 Warren/Harris/Buttigieg 2020: Dec 2018\u2013Jan 2019 (-13 to -12 mo)\n\nIf Iowa/NH remain early Feb 2028, filings would normally begin Q1\u2013Q2 2027. By that yardstick the absence of 2028 committees in early 2026 is fully in line with precedent, even as PAC fundraising, memoir rollouts and early-state travel appear roughly 9-12 months ahead of past invisible primaries.\n\n6.  Candidate snapshots \u2013 February 2026  \n\u2022 Gavin Newsom \u2013 Largest disclosed federal cash; newly explicit interest in 2028; national media omnipresence.  \n\u2022 Kamala Harris \u2013 Only figure openly conceding she\u2019s \u201cpossibly\u201d running; super-PAC plus book tour provide both narrative and fundraising scaffolding.  \n\u2022 Josh Shapiro \u2013 Biggest single pot of money ($30 m state); memoir and early-state travel remain his primary signals.  \n\u2022 Gretchen Whitmer \u2013 DGA vice-chair role boosts national profile; awaiting PAC filings to gauge cash.  \n\u2022 Pete Buttigieg \u2013 Active email list and policy media but opaque finances.  \n\u2022 Joe Biden \u2013 Structurally dormant; no sign of comeback bid.\n\n7.  Early-state calendar  \nNine states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, have petitioned the DNC for early-window slots (previous round). A favorable Rules & Bylaws Committee decision\u2014still pending\u2014could materially advantage Whitmer or Shapiro.\n\n8.  What\u2019s new compared with the last report  \n\u2022 Harris escalated from vague hints to declaring she is \u201cnot done\u201d and \u201cpossibly\u201d running (BBC).  \n\u2022 Newsom shed coyness, telling national audiences he is contemplating 2028 (CalMatters).  \n\u2022 Whitmer assumed a high-visibility national fundraising role (DGA vice-chair).  \nNo structural changes occurred in filings, endorsements or published fundraising totals.\n\n9.  Remaining information gaps  \na. FEC year-end 2025 receipts & cash-on-hand for Whitmer\u2019s \u201cFight Like Hell PAC,\u201d Harris\u2019s \u201cFight for the People,\u201d and Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cWin the Era.\u201d  \nb. Any first-tier endorsement by sitting or former Democratic officials.  \nc. Definitive DNC ruling on 2028 primary calendar.  \nd. Any explicit statement from Joe Biden closing\u2014or reopening\u2014the door to a bid.\n\nUntil those numbers and statements surface, the 2028 Democratic race will remain an invisible primary fought mainly through PAC ledgers, memoir tours and cable-news appearances.\n\n(The analysis relies on Detroit Free Press 8 Dec 2025; OpenSecrets Fight Like Hell PAC profile 2024; CNN 19 Sep 2025; BBC 25 Oct 2025; CalMatters 25 Sep 2025; FEC browse page 2026.)\n\nVerification checklist  \n1.
