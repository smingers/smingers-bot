Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Recent AskNews Articles (Feb 7, 2026):**
- **Quality:** High - Multiple articles from established sources (AFP, Semana, Infobae) all citing the same AtlasIntel survey (Jan 27-Feb 4, 2026, n=7,298, ±1% margin)
- **Date:** 1 day old - extremely current
- **Key facts:** De la Espriella 32.1%, Cepeda 31.4% (technical tie); runoff scenarios favor de la Espriella; high rejection rates (43.9% Cepeda, 33.6% de la Espriella)
- **Expert opinion:** Andrei Roman (AtlasIntel CEO) on digital presence and anti-Petro dynamics - identifiable expert with direct data access
- **Factual vs. opinion:** Poll numbers are factual; candidate characterizations ("eccentric," "tiger") are descriptive but sourced to candidate statements; rejection data is factual

**Gran Consulta Articles (Feb 7, 2026):**
- **Quality:** Moderate-high - Semana reporting on AtlasIntel primary polling
- **Key facts:** Valencia leads primary at 26.9%, Dávila surged to 15.4% (doubled from 7% in January); hypothetical runoffs show Cepeda beats Valencia by 8.3 points, beats Pinzón by 17 points
- **Critical insight:** Even if Valencia wins primary, her national support only rises to 8.7% - insufficient to challenge frontrunners
- **Factual:** Primary polling numbers are data; strategic implications are analysis

**Roy Barreras Article (Feb 7, 2026):**
- **Quality:** Moderate - Semana analysis piece
- **Key facts:** Barreras attempting to divide left through "Frente por la Vida" consultation; Cepeda has unified petrista sector; Barreras lacks Petro backing
- **Opinion vs. fact:** Strategic assessments are opinion, but Barreras' isolation from Petro/key allies is factual
- **Relevance:** Moderate - shows left consolidating around Cepeda, reducing fragmentation risk

**Older Sources (Dec 2025-Jan 2026):**
- **AS/COA (Dec 17, 2025):** Invamer poll showing Cepeda 32%, de la Espriella 18% - now superseded by more recent data
- **City Paper (Jan 13, 2026):** AtlasIntel showing de la Espriella 28%, Cepeda 26.5% - trend toward de la Espriella confirmed by latest data
- **Americas Quarterly:** Economic context (2.7% GDP growth, 5%+ inflation) and security concerns remain relevant background
- **Polymarket (Dec 7, 2025):** Cepeda 42%, de la Espriella 35% - prediction market, now outdated but shows sentiment shift

**Historical Context (Oct 2025):**
- **Pacto Histórico Primary:** Cepeda won with 64.4% (1.02M votes) vs. Corcho 29.5% - demonstrates organizational strength
- **Turnout:** Low relative to 41.2M registered voters - suggests enthusiasm gap

**Discarded Sources:**
- Astrologer prediction (Sept 2025) - not credible evidence
- World Politics Review - too general, no specific data

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **Polling convergence (Feb 2026):** AtlasIntel survey showing de la Espriella 32.1%, Cepeda 31.4% is consistent with January trend (28% vs. 26.5%) and represents largest, most recent poll. Multiple independent articles confirm same data. **Impact:** Confirms two-horse race, slight de la Espriella advantage.

2. **Runoff dynamics:** AtlasIntel runoff scenarios show de la Espriella defeating Cepeda by 2.2 points (36.8% vs. 34.6%), defeating Fajardo by 10.1 points. Cepeda defeats Valencia by 8.3 points, Pinzón by 17 points. **Impact:** De la Espriella has broader coalition potential; Valencia/Fajardo unlikely to reach runoff.

3. **Rejection rates:** Cepeda 43.9%, de la Espriella 33.6%, both rejected by 22.5%. **Impact:** High polarization limits both frontrunners' ceilings; creates opening for compromise candidate but also suggests consolidation around top two.

4. **Primary polling structure:** Valencia leads Gran Consulta at 26.9%, but national support only 3.8% (rises to 8.7% if she wins). Dávila at 15.4% in primary but not in national race. **Impact:** Primary winner unlikely to challenge frontrunners; may become VP candidate.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

1. **Left consolidation:** Cepeda won Pacto Histórico primary with 64.4%; Barreras isolated from Petro/key allies; CNE ruling excludes Cepeda from March 8 primary. **Impact:** Reduces left fragmentation risk for Cepeda, but Barreras/Quintero could still split vote.

2. **Petro's unpopularity:** 57% disapproval, 35.7% approval per multiple sources. 81% want good U.S. ties. **Impact:** Anti-Petro sentiment favors de la Espriella, but Petro's 38% base supports Cepeda.

3. **Security concerns:** Multiple sources cite rising violence, crime as top voter concern. **Impact:** Favors de la Espriella's hardline stance over Cepeda's negotiation approach.

4. **Fajardo's stagnation:** Consistently 7-10% across multiple polls over 3 months. **Impact:** Centrist theory not translating to practice; unlikely to surge.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

1. **Dávila's surge:** Doubled from 7% to 15.4% in primary polling (Jan to Feb). **Impact:** Shows volatility possible, but she's not running nationally yet.

2. **De la Espriella's "phenomenon" framing:** Self-described outsider with no political experience. **Impact:** Narrative momentum but hard to quantify.

3. **Polymarket shift:** Showed Cepeda leading in December, now outdated. **Impact:** Demonstrates sentiment can shift but superseded by current data.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 112 days to first round (May 31), 133 days to potential runoff (June 21)

**Critical inflection point:** March 8 primary (28 days away) will:
- Consolidate or fragment right-wing vote
- Potentially produce VP candidate for de la Espriella
- Test organizational strength of various factions
- Provide momentum signal

**If timeframe halved (56 days):** Would increase confidence in current frontrunners as insufficient time for major shifts. Polling would be more predictive. Would increase de la Espriella/Cepeda combined probability to ~75-80%.

**If timeframe doubled (224 days):** Would significantly increase uncertainty. Costa Rica 2022 precedent shows candidates can surge from 5th place. Would increase "Another candidate" probability to 25-30% and reduce frontrunner confidence.

**Current assessment:** 3.7 months is sufficient time for one major shift (e.g., primary winner surge, scandal, external shock) but not multiple dramatic reversals. Frontrunner status is meaningful but not determinative.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rates:**
- De la Espriella: 38%
- Cepeda: 32%
- Fajardo: 10%
- Valencia: 6%
- Another candidate: 14%

**Key shifts based on current evidence:**

1. **De la Espriella (+2-4%):** Latest polling shows strengthening position (32.1% vs. 28% in January). Runoff advantage over all opponents is strong evidence. Anti-Petro sentiment (57% disapproval) and security focus align with voter priorities. **Shift to 40-42%.**

2. **Cepeda (-2-3%):** While maintaining strong second place (31.4%), high rejection rate (43.9%) is concerning. Left consolidation around him is positive, but ceiling appears lower than de la Espriella's. Petro association is double-edged. **Shift to 29-30%.**

3. **Fajardo (-1-2%):** Three months of stagnation at 7-10% despite theoretically optimal centrist positioning. No evidence of momentum. Runoff scenarios show him losing badly to de la Espriella. **Shift to 8-9%.**

4. **Valencia (+2-3%):** Primary polling shows her leading at 26.9%, and Dávila's surge to 15.4% shows volatility in that lane. Uribe endorsement and potential VP slot with de la Espriella creates plausible path. However, national support remains very low (3.8-8.7%). **Shift to 8-9%.**

5. **Another candidate (-2-3%):** Field has consolidated significantly since 100+ initial aspirants. Major candidates are now defined. Quintero is only new wildcard but faces organizational challenges. March 8 primary will further consolidate field. **Shift to 11-13%.**

**Justification for magnitude:** The shifts are modest (2-4 percentage points) because:
- We're still 3.7 months out with major primary intervening
- Polling shows technical tie between top two
- High rejection rates and undecided voters create uncertainty
- Historical precedent (Costa Rica 2022) shows late surges possible
- Two-round system allows coalition building

However, the evidence is strong enough to warrant some adjustment:
- Multiple independent polls converging
- Structural factors (rejection rates, runoff dynamics) favor de la Espriella
- Left consolidation reduces Cepeda fragmentation risk
- Primary dynamics unlikely to produce viable challenger to top two

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo continuation:** If current trends hold, de la Espriella maintains slight lead, reaches runoff with Cepeda, wins runoff by 2-5 points based on broader coalition appeal.

**True probability vs. hedged:** Must avoid overconfidence. Technical tie in polling (32.1% vs. 31.4%) should not translate to large probability gap. However, runoff dynamics and rejection rates provide structural advantage to de la Espriella beyond first-round polling.

**Probability granularity check:**
- 42% vs. 29% represents roughly 3:2 odds vs. 2:1 odds
- This 13-point gap is justified by: (a) runoff advantage, (b) lower rejection rate, (c) momentum trend, (d) alignment with voter priorities
- But gap should not exceed 15 points given polling margin of error and timeframe

**Upset scenarios:**
- Valencia wins primary convincingly, becomes VP candidate, consolidates right: 8-9%
- Fajardo surges as compromise candidate: 8-9%
- Quintero or other leftist fragments Cepeda support, new candidate emerges: 5-6%
- External shock (scandal, economic crisis, security event): 6-7%
- Combined "Another candidate": 11-13%

**Final calibration:**
- De la Espriella: 42% (up from 38%)
- Cepeda: 29% (down from 32%)
- Fajardo: 9% (down from 10%)
- Valencia: 8% (up from 6%)
- Another candidate: 12% (down from 14%)

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Colombian presidential election May 31/June 21, 2026. Winner determined by name on ballot in deciding round. Four named candidates vs. field.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view: de la Espriella 38%, Cepeda 32%, Fajardo 10%, Valencia 6%, Another 14%. Current prediction maintains this structure with modest adjustments.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely: de la Espriella (42%) and Cepeda (29%) - makes sense given polling convergence and runoff dynamics. Least likely: Fajardo (9%), Valencia (8%), Another (12%) - aligned with evidence of stagnation and field consolidation.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - AtlasIntel Feb 2026: de la Espriella 32.1%, Cepeda 31.4% (technical tie, largest recent poll)
   - Runoff scenarios: de la Espriella defeats all opponents; Cepeda beats Valencia/Pinzón but loses to de la Espriella
   - Rejection rates: Cepeda 43.9%, de la Espriella 33.6% (ceiling constraints, polarization)
   - Primary dynamics: Valencia leads at 26.9% but national support only 8.7% maximum
   - Left consolidation: Cepeda won primary 64.4%, Barreras isolated (reduces fragmentation)

5. **Blind spot:** Valencia wins primary decisively, becomes de la Espriella's VP, creating unified right-wing ticket that dominates. Or: Major scandal/external shock (U.S.-Colombia tensions, security crisis) reshuffles race entirely. Would shift 10-15% probability from frontrunners to Valencia or Another.

6. **Status quo:** Current polling shows stable two-horse race with slight de la Espriella advantage. March 8 primary unlikely to fundamentally alter this unless Valencia surges dramatically. Modest shift toward de la Espriella justified but should remain conservative given 3.7-month timeframe.

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 8-42, no % signs.

Probabilities: [29, 42, 9, 8, 12]
