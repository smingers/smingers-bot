Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Outside View Sources:**
1. **AS/COA (Dec 17, 2025)**: Reputable regional policy organization. Reports November 2025 Invamer poll showing Cepeda 32%, De la Espriella 18%. Factual polling data, though 2.5 months old. Expert commentary is general analysis rather than specific predictions.

2. **The City Paper Bogotá (Jan 13, 2026)**: Reports Atlas Intel poll with De la Espriella 28%, Cepeda 26.5%, Fajardo 9.4%. One month old. Includes expert quote from Andrei Roman (Atlas Intel CEO) - identifiable source discussing methodology and race structure. Mix of factual polling and strategic analysis.

3. **Americas Quarterly (date unclear, likely Jan 2026)**: Reputable policy journal. Discusses Atlas Intel polling, economic data, security concerns. Expert quote from Camilo Granada (political analyst) - identifiable but speculative about voter considerations. Factual on context, opinion on impact.

4. **World Politics Review (Jan 12, 2026)**: Broad overview, minimal specific data. Notes race is "muddled" and "inconclusive" - general observation rather than hard evidence.

5. **CFR (Dec 9, 2025)**: Highly reputable source. Reports polling showing Cepeda and Fajardo both at 24%. Three months old, predates recent momentum shifts. Factual on context and candidates.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 7-8, 2026 - MOST RECENT):**
6. **Multiple AFP/Spanish sources (Feb 7, 2026)**: Report latest AtlasIntel survey (Jan 27-Feb 4, n=7,298): De la Espriella 32.1%, Cepeda 31.4% - technical tie. This is the freshest polling data, conducted just days ago. Factual polling results with candidate profiles.

7. **Semana.com articles (Feb 7, 2026)**: Multiple articles on same AtlasIntel poll, plus Gran Consulta primary polling showing Valencia leading at 26.9%, Dávila 15.4% (doubled from 7% in January). Factual polling data from identifiable pollster.

8. **Historical articles (Oct 2025)**: Report Cepeda won Pacto Histórico internal consultation with 65% (1.02M votes), defeating Corcho. Factual outcome, establishes Cepeda as official left candidate.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Latest AtlasIntel poll (Feb 7, 2026)**: Multiple independent sources confirm same data - De la Espriella 32.1%, Cepeda 31.4%, technical tie. This is a large-sample (n=7,298), recent poll from a reputable pollster. Shows clear two-horse race structure.
- **Historical consolidation pattern**: Multiple sources confirm that in runoff scenarios, De la Espriella defeats Cepeda by 9.3 points (36.8% vs 34.6%), while Cepeda defeats all other candidates. This suggests structural advantage for right-wing consolidation.
- **Gran Consulta dynamics (March 8)**: Valencia leads primary at 26.9%, but even if she wins, her first-round support only rises to 8.7%. This structural barrier makes her unlikely to reach runoff.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Momentum trends**: Dávila doubled support (7% to 15.4%) in one month, showing volatility in right-wing primary. However, she remains far behind leaders.
- **Rejection rates**: Cepeda has 43.9% rejection vs De la Espriella's 33.6%. This asymmetry favors De la Espriella in runoff scenarios.
- **Petro's unpopularity**: 57% disapproval, but maintains 38% base. Cepeda is closely tied to Petro, creating both floor and ceiling effects.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Polymarket prediction (Dec 2025)**: Showed Cepeda at 42%, but this is outdated and prediction markets can be thin/volatile.
- **Expert speculation**: Various analysts discuss "anti-Petro front" and consolidation, but these are forward-looking opinions rather than established facts.
- **Fajardo's trajectory**: Placed 4th in 2022 with only 4.2%, suggesting structural weakness. Current 7.6% polling is consistent with limited appeal.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeline**: 113 days to first round (May 31, 2026), 134 days to potential runoff (June 21, 2026).

**Critical upcoming events**:
- March 8, 2026 (29 days): Gran Consulta primary + legislative elections - will consolidate right-wing field
- March-May: Historical consolidation window in Colombian elections

**If timeframe halved (56 days)**: Current polling would be more predictive; less time for consolidation or surprises. Would increase confidence in De la Espriella/Cepeda duopoly, reduce "Another candidate" probability.

**If timeframe doubled (226 days)**: More time for momentum shifts, scandals, or new entrants. Would increase uncertainty, raise "Another candidate" probability, and allow more time for Fajardo or Valencia to gain traction.

Current timeframe (113 days) is in the "sweet spot" where recent polling is meaningful but consolidation dynamics will still play out significantly.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rates**: De la Espriella 35%, Cepeda 25%, Fajardo 20%, Valencia 10%, Another 10%

**Key factors warranting adjustments**:

1. **Two-horse race structure (Strong evidence)**: Latest polling shows De la Espriella and Cepeda in technical tie, both ~32%, with third place (Fajardo) at only 7.6%. This is more concentrated than historical Colombian races. The gap between top-2 and rest is unusually large this early.
   - **Impact**: Reduces Fajardo and "Another candidate" probabilities significantly.

2. **Right-wing consolidation advantage (Strong evidence)**: Runoff polling consistently shows De la Espriella defeating Cepeda by 9+ points, while Cepeda defeats all others. The Gran Consulta on March 8 will consolidate right-wing support behind one candidate (likely Valencia), who will then likely endorse De la Espriella.
   - **Impact**: Increases De la Espriella probability above outside view baseline.

3. **Cepeda's structural ceiling (Moderate-Strong evidence)**: 43.9% rejection rate and close association with unpopular Petro (57% disapproval) creates a ceiling. However, he has a solid 38% base and leads in Caribbean/Pacific regions.
   - **Impact**: Keeps Cepeda competitive but slightly below De la Espriella.

4. **Fajardo's limited viability (Strong evidence)**: Historical 4.2% in 2022, current 7.6% polling, described as "struggling to expand base." No clear path to runoff.
   - **Impact**: Reduces Fajardo significantly from 20% baseline.

5. **Valencia's structural barriers (Strong evidence)**: Even winning Gran Consulta only yields 8.7% first-round support. Would need massive consolidation to reach runoff.
   - **Impact**: Reduces Valencia from 10% baseline.

6. **Time until consolidation (Moderate evidence)**: March 8 primary is 29 days away. Historical pattern shows consolidation happens March-May. We're at the cusp of this window.
   - **Impact**: Moderate uncertainty remains, but current structure is likely to persist.

**Justification for large shifts**: The current race structure is MORE consolidated than historical Colombian elections at this stage. The 32%-32%-8% polling distribution is unusually top-heavy. This makes the reference class somewhat less analogous - typically Colombian races had 3-4 viable candidates at this stage, not a clear duopoly.

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo continuation**: If current trends hold, De la Espriella and Cepeda advance to runoff, with De la Espriella winning 37-35% based on polling. This suggests ~55-60% probability for De la Espriella, ~35-40% for Cepeda.

**Adjustments from outside view**:

1. **De la Espriella**: Outside view 35% → Inside view 45%
   - +10 points for: technical tie in polling, runoff advantage, right-wing consolidation dynamics, lower rejection rate
   - Current momentum and structural advantages warrant increase

2. **Cepeda**: Outside view 25% → Inside view 35%
   - +10 points for: technical tie in polling, solid base, won internal consultation decisively
   - But ceiling effects and rejection rate prevent parity with De la Espriella

3. **Fajardo**: Outside view 20% → Inside view 8%
   - -12 points for: only 7.6% in latest poll, historical weakness, no clear consolidation path
   - Centre bloc historically weaker than 20% baseline suggests

4. **Valencia**: Outside view 10% → Inside view 5%
   - -5 points for: structural barriers even if winning primary, would need extraordinary consolidation
   - Some probability remains as she could theoretically consolidate entire right-wing

5. **Another candidate**: Outside view 10% → Inside view 7%
   - -3 points for: race is more consolidated than historical norm, but 113 days still allows surprises
   - Maintains non-trivial probability for late entrant or unexpected consolidation

**Calibration check**: 
- 45% for De la Espriella reflects slight favorite status (9:11 odds against), consistent with technical polling tie but structural advantages
- 35% for Cepeda reflects strong second (13:7 odds against), consistent with solid base but ceiling
- Combined 80% for top-2 reflects unusually consolidated race structure
- 8% for Fajardo reflects long-shot status (11.5:1 against), consistent with single-digit polling
- 12% combined for Valencia/Another reflects uncertainty but acknowledges low base probabilities

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Winner of May 31/June 21, 2026 Colombian presidential election among five named candidates.

2. **Base rate check**: Outside view was De la Espriella 35%, Cepeda 25%, Fajardo 20%, Valencia 10%, Another 10%. Final prediction shifts toward top-2 due to unusually consolidated race structure.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = De la Espriella (45%) and Cepeda (35%); Least likely = Valencia (5%). Makes sense given technical tie in polling but De la Espriella's structural advantages.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - AtlasIntel Feb 7: De la Espriella 32.1%, Cepeda 31.4%, Fajardo 7.6% (technical tie, consolidated field)
   - Runoff polling: De la Espriella defeats Cepeda by 9+ points consistently
   - Rejection rates: Cepeda 43.9% vs De la Espriella 33.6% (ceiling effect)
   - Valencia primary: Even if wins, only 8.7% first-round support (structural barrier)
   - Historical pattern: Right-wing consolidation typically successful in Colombia

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected scandal involving De la Espriella (past defense of controversial clients) or major security crisis that shifts voter priorities dramatically. Could boost Cepeda to 45-50% or open door for "Another candidate" to 15-20%.

6. **Status quo**: Current polling shows technical tie with slight structural advantage to De la Espriella. 113 days allows consolidation but race structure likely persists. Slight nudge toward De la Espriella (45% vs 40%) reflects this.

7. **Technical check**: Probabilities sum to 100, all between 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [35, 45, 8, 5, 7]
