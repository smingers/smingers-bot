## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Colombian presidential elections with term-limited incumbents (2002, 2010, 2018):**
   - Suitability: High - directly comparable institutional context
   - Pattern: Incumbent party typically struggles; 2018 saw Duque (right) defeat Petro after Santos (center-left)
   - Runoffs common; first-round leader often wins

2. **Latin American elections with unpopular left-wing incumbents (2023-2024):**
   - Suitability: Moderate - regional trend data
   - Pattern: Argentina 2023 (Milei upset), Chile 2021 (Boric win then backlash)
   - High volatility, outsider candidates performing well

3. **Colombian elections with high undecided voters (2022, 2018):**
   - Suitability: High - 62% undecided in Nov 2025 mirrors historical patterns
   - Pattern: Late momentum shifts common; 2022 saw Petro overcome skepticism
   - Centrist candidates historically underperform expectations

4. **Elections with fragmented fields and March primaries (2022, 2018):**
   - Suitability: Very High - identical electoral calendar and structure
   - Pattern: Primaries consolidate but don't always predict winners; coalition-building crucial
   - "Another candidate" outcomes rare once field narrows by March

**Selected Reference Class:** Colombian presidential elections with term-limited incumbents and fragmented fields (2002, 2010, 2018), weighted toward recent 2018/2022 patterns given similar polarization dynamics.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 134 days until first round (May 31, 2026); 163 days until potential runoff (June 21, 2026)

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods:**

- **4-5 months before election (current position):**
  - 2022: Petro led polls but margin fluctuated; Hernández surged late
  - 2018: Duque maintained lead; Petro consolidated left
  - 2010: Santos dominated after party primary
  - Pattern: Frontrunners at this stage win ~60% of the time, but upsets occur

- **March primaries impact:**
  - Historically consolidate support within blocs
  - Winners gain 5-10 point bounces
  - Losers who don't unite behind winner fragment vote

- **Late-stage dynamics:**
  - Security crises, scandals, or economic shocks can shift 10-15 points
  - Undecided voters break late (final 2-4 weeks)
  - Runoffs typically favor candidate with broader coalition potential

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors for Outside View:**

1. **Current polling convergence:** Despite methodological differences, De la Espriella and Cepeda consistently occupy top two positions across all recent polls (Atlas Intel, Invamer, GAD3). This is a strong signal.

2. **Anti-incumbent dynamics:** Petro's 35.7% approval with 53.7% disapproval creates strong headwinds for Cepeda as the Pacto Histórico candidate. Historical pattern: incumbent party candidates underperform when president below 40% approval.

3. **Fragmentation risk:** 
   - Left: Quintero's Feb 5 reinstatement creates split progressive vote risk
   - Right: Valencia/De la Espriella competition, though De la Espriella leads decisively
   - Center: Fajardo isolated, historically underperforms

4. **Outsider advantage:** De la Espriella's "anti-establishment" positioning aligns with regional trend (Bukele, Milei) and benefits from security concerns being top voter priority.

5. **Structural factors:**
   - March 8 consultas will clarify but likely consolidate current leaders
   - Runoff dynamics favor candidate who can build broader coalition
   - De la Espriella's runoff polling shows consistent advantages

6. **Uncertainty factors:**
   - 62% undecided (Nov 2025) means high volatility potential
   - No post-Feb 5 CNE ruling polls available
   - VP selections unknown
   - 134 days allows for significant momentum shifts

7. **Base rates from reference class:**
   - Frontrunner at 4 months out wins: ~60%
   - Top-2 at this stage make runoff: ~85%
   - "Another candidate" (outside current top-4) wins: ~5-10%

**Outside View Calibration:**

## (a) True Probability vs. Hedged Projection

I must avoid:
- Overconfidence in current polling (methodological splits evident)
- Underweighting uncertainty (62% undecided, 134 days remaining)
- Ignoring historical upset rates in Colombian elections

I should weight:
- Consistent polling positions across multiple methodologies
- Structural advantages (anti-incumbent mood, security focus)
- Historical patterns of primary consolidation

## (b) Previously Established Distributions

**Colombian presidential election base rates (2002-2022):**
- Candidate leading at 4-5 months: 60% win probability
- Second-place at this stage: 25% win probability
- Third-place: 10% win probability
- Fourth-place or lower: 5% win probability

**Adjustment factors:**
- High undecided rate (+10% uncertainty to trailing candidates)
- Petro's unpopularity (-5% to his coalition candidate)
- Regional outsider trend (+5% to anti-establishment candidate)

## (c) Probability Granularity

- De la Espriella: Leading most recent polls, structural advantages, but 134 days of uncertainty
- Cepeda: Strong base (25% identify with Pacto Histórico), but anti-incumbent headwinds
- Fajardo: Consistently third, but centrist path theoretically viable per Guzmán
- Valencia: Distant fourth, needs primary win + consolidation + VP slot scenario
- Another: March consultas could produce surprise, but field largely set

## (d) Historical Upset Rate

Colombian presidential elections have ~20-25% upset rate (candidate not leading at 4-5 months wins). Recent Latin American elections show higher volatility (~30-35%). Split the difference at ~25-30% for uncertainty allocation.

Outside View Prediction:

Based on current polling convergence, structural factors, historical patterns, and remaining uncertainty, my outside view probabilities are:

Iván Cepeda: 30%
Abelardo de la Espriella: 42%
Sergio Fajardo: 12%
Paloma Valencia: 6%
Another candidate: 10%
