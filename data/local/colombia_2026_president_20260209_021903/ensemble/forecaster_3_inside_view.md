Analysis:

1) Resolution/Options paraphrase (≤30 words)  
Winner is the name printed on the ballot who ultimately wins Colombia’s 2026 presidency (May 31 first round; June 21 runoff if needed): Cepeda, de la Espriella, Fajardo, Valencia, or someone else.

2) (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; facts vs opinions)

- AS/COA preview (Dec 17, 2025): High-quality regional policy analysis; cites Invamer poll (Nov 2025) with Cepeda leading and Petro disapproval ~57%. Mostly factual polling + contextual interpretation (opinion) that left shouldn’t be counted out. Somewhat dated vs Feb 2026 polling.

- CFR “Ten Elections to Watch” (Dec 9, 2025): High-credibility think tank summary; notes Petro unpopularity, security deterioration, and gives a “close race” framing with polling figures. Useful structural context; dated and polling snapshot differs from newer AtlasIntel.

- World Politics Review (Jan 12, 2026): High-quality but very general; says field is muddled and polling inconclusive. Mostly commentary; little direct measurable evidence.

- City Paper Bogotá re AtlasIntel (Jan 13, 2026): Moderate quality secondary reporting but references identifiable pollster (AtlasIntel) and provides head-to-head runoff numbers (facts). Analytical claims about coalition dynamics are opinion.

- Americas Quarterly piece (date in excerpt; recent-ish): Generally strong outlet; provides AtlasIntel snapshot + macro context (economy, U.S./Venezuela angle). Mix of facts (polling, approval) and expert interpretations (Granada quote).

- AFP profile/poll story (Feb 7, 2026): High-quality wire service; reports latest AtlasIntel/Semana numbers (facts) and candidate profiles. Minimal editorializing; framing language but evidence largely polling + background.

- Infobae (Feb 7, 2026): Mass-market outlet; okay for reproducing poll tables, but more noise. Still, it cites the same AtlasIntel poll with sample size/margin (facts).

- Semana.com multiple items (Feb 7, 2026): Major Colombian outlet with clear poll sourcing (AtlasIntel for Semana). Some pieces are political narrative/opinion; the key value is the consistent reporting of the same poll results and consultation subsamples (facts).

- El Cronista (Feb 7, 2026): Secondary reporting of the same AtlasIntel/Semana poll. Useful corroboration; not primary.

- El Universal (Feb 2, 2026): Administrative/electoral logistics (candidate registration window etc.). High reliability for process facts; minimal predictive value.

- KTVZ/CNN Español pickup (Jan 22, 2026): Candidate interview (de la Espriella). Useful only as a signal of messaging; not evidence of electoral strength beyond what polls show (opinion/self-serving claims).

- El Colombiano (Jan 9, 2026): Reputable Colombian outlet; details about “Gran Consulta” mechanics and how consultations historically confer legitimacy/visibility. Mix of facts (process, parties) and expert opinion about likely narrowing.

- Semana on Polymarket (Dec 7, 2025): Prediction market snapshot (facts about market prices). Markets can be informative but can be thin/biased; moderate evidentiary weight.

- PULZO astrologer (Sep 29, 2025): Weak/entertainment; not decision-relevant.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (largest shifts)
- Convergent, very recent polling: Multiple Feb 7, 2026 reports (AFP/Infobae/Semana/El Cronista) citing the same large AtlasIntel poll (n≈7,298; ±1%) showing a technical tie in first-round intent between Abelardo de la Espriella (~32.1%) and Iván Cepeda (~31.4%). This strongly supports “two-horse race” and makes Fajardo/Valencia longshots under current preferences.
- Runoff structure + current head-to-head: Same poll shows de la Espriella narrowly ahead vs Cepeda in a direct runoff simulation (approx 36.8 vs 34.6), implying the anti-Petro coalition currently has a slight edge in the decisive matchup.
- Structural incumbency/approval environment: Petro approval mid-30s, disapproval low/mid-50s across cited sources (AS/COA, AQ, CFR). That’s a persistent headwind for the “continuity” candidate (Cepeda), and not easily changed quickly.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- High rejection/blank/undecided: AtlasIntel reports ~30% blank/undecided/nonvoter intention and high rejection for both (Cepeda rejection higher than de la Espriella). This increases uncertainty and boosts “Another candidate” via consolidation/scandal pathways.
- March 8 consultations as coordination device: El Colombiano and Semana coverage indicate consultations can produce a “bounce” and coordinate party machinery. That increases the chance a consultation winner (not in the named list) becomes viable—though current poll levels suggest they start far behind.
- Expert/analyst framing: “anti-Petro front vs continuity” (AtlasIntel CEO quote via City Paper) is a plausible causal story consistent with polling.

Weak evidence (small/no shifts)
- Candidate tweets about unity (Semana): Signals intent to coordinate but is cheap talk.
- De la Espriella self-claims of two-horse race (CNN interview): Not probative beyond polls.
- Astrology prediction: disregarded.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 2026-02-08. Time to first round (May 31): ~112 days. Time to (likely) runoff (June 21): ~133 days.

If timeframe were halved (~66 days to runoff): I’d put more weight on current polling and reduce “Another candidate” (less time for consolidation or shocks).  
If timeframe were doubled (~266 days): I’d materially increase “Another candidate” and slightly increase Fajardo/Valencia (more time for re-sorting, scandals, security/economic shocks).

5) (d) Justification: how inside view shifts the outside view

Outside view base rate distribution (given):  
Cepeda 30 / de la Espriella 42 / Fajardo 12 / Valencia 6 / Another 10

Key updates since that baseline:
- The newest (late Jan–early Feb fieldwork) AtlasIntel poll shows Cepeda essentially tied with de la Espriella in first round, rather than clearly trailing. That pushes Cepeda up modestly and trims de la Espriella somewhat (the race is closer than the outside-view “rightward shift” narrative alone).
- However, the same poll still gives de la Espriella a small advantage in the direct runoff against Cepeda, and Petro-era fatigue/security salience remains a structural drag on the Petro-aligned candidate. So de la Espriella remains the single most likely winner.
- “Another candidate” becomes more plausible than in the outside view because: (i) consultations on March 8 can coordinate elites and voters, (ii) ~30% are blank/undecided/nonvoter-intending, and (iii) both front-runners have high rejection—conditions under which a late “acceptable alternative” can emerge if the anti-left vote coordinates behind someone else or if one front-runner suffers a major scandal/security crisis misstep.

Net: move probability mass from de la Espriella (down) and from Fajardo/Valencia (down) into Cepeda (up slightly) and Another (up more).

Probability calibration

Status quo if trends continue: de la Espriella vs Cepeda runoff; slight de la Espriella edge.  
I’m treating ±10 points as meaningful: shifting 10 from de la Espriella to Cepeda would imply believing Cepeda is now clearly favored in the runoff, which current head-to-head polling does not support. Shifting 10 into “Another” would imply expecting consultations or a shock to reliably upend the top two, which seems possible but not the modal path.

Checklist:
1. Options/criteria aligned: winner is printed ballot name; May 31 / June 21; options include “Another candidate”.  
2. Outside-view anchor used: [30, 42, 12, 6, 10].  
3. Consistency check: Most likely = de la Espriella; Least likely = Valencia; yes (polling places her far back; top two dominate).  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):
   - AtlasIntel (Jan27–Feb4) shows technical tie: de la Espriella ~32.1, Cepeda ~31.4.
   - AtlasIntel runoff sim: de la Espriella narrowly leads Cepeda (~36.8 vs ~34.6).
   - Petro approval mid-30s/disapproval mid-50s → continuity candidate faces headwind.
   - ~30% blank/undecided/nonvoter + high rejection → volatility and coalition opportunities.
5. Blind spot: A consultation winner or centrist unity candidate consolidates anti-Petro vote and displaces de la Espriella. Would shift probability from de la Espriella to Another.  
6. Status quo nudge: kept de la Espriella as modal winner; didn’t overreact to one poll.  
7. Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100, in correct order.
