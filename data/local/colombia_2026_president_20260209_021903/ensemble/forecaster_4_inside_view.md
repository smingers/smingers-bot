Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of options and resolution criteria (≤30 words).  
Winner = candidate whose printed name tops the final, decisive presidential round by 22 June 2026. Options: Cepeda, De la Espriella, Fajardo, Valencia, or any other person (“Another candidate”).

2. Source analysis (quality & facts vs. opinion).

a. AFP / El Cronista / Infobae package (7 Feb 2026) – AtlasIntel nationwide poll (7 ,298 respondents, MoE ±1%). Facts: first-round tie 32.1 vs 31.4, 30 % undecided/blank; De la Espriella edges Cepeda in simulated runoff. Quality: strong (large sample, transparent dates, independent pollster), very recent → strong evidence.

b. City Paper Bogotá (13 Jan 2026) – AtlasIntel poll 28 / 26.5. Consistent direction, slightly older. Quality: moderate; corroborative → moderate evidence.

c. Americas Quarterly (19 Jan 2026) – notes AtlasIntel lead for De la Espriella, Petro approval 35.7 %. Opinion quotes from analyst Camilo Granada. Quality: medium; macro context → moderate evidence.

d. CFR (9 Dec 2025) – Invamer poll Cepeda 32 , Espriella 18. Older. Useful for trend (Cepeda lead eroded) → weak-to-moderate.

e. Polymarket odds (Dec 2025) – 42 % Cepeda, 35 % Espriella. Thin market, two months old → weak.

f. World Politics Review (12 Jan 2026) – says polling inconclusive. Broad opinion → weak.

g. News on Gran Consulta primaries (Semana 7 Feb 2026) – Valencia leads internal right primary at 26.9 %, but would still be only 8 – 9 % nationally. Good factual detail, but contingent → moderate evidence that Valencia’s ceiling is low.

h. Registration article (El Universal 2 Feb 2026) – confirms 15 certified aspirants, shows fluid field. Quality: factual; weak-moderate evidence sustaining “Another candidate” bucket.

3. Evidence weighting.

Strong evidence:  
• Two independent AtlasIntel polls (Jan & Feb) both show Espriella ≈ Cepeda, Espriella slight edge in runoff.  
• Petro disapproval > 55 % (Invamer, AtlasIntel) → historical anti-incumbent pattern.

Moderate evidence:  
• Security concerns & “Bukele effect” (AQ, AFP) logically favor hardline right option.  
• Right bloc likely to unify after March 8 primary; structure historically boosts winner (2018 Duque, 2022 Fico) but not determinative.

Weak evidence:  
• Prediction market odds (Dec 2025).  
• Speculative astrology piece (discarded).  
• WPR assertion of high uncertainty without data.

4. Timeframe analysis.  
~3.8 months to first round, 4.5 months to runoff. Halving (≈7 weeks) would solidify polls, reduce “Another” risk by ~5  pp. Doubling (≈9 months) would greatly reopen field; I’d place “Another” ≥25–30 %.

5. Justification – major factors shifting the outside view.

• Espriella’s measurable first-round and runoff lead (strong evidence) nudges him above Cepeda.  
• Sustained anti-Petro sentiment and insecurity environment favour right outsider (moderate evidence).  
• Yet 30 % undecided/blank + pending March primaries preserve uncertainty, so “Another candidate” remains non-trivial.  
• Fajardo and Valencia still poll single digits; historical Colombian campaigns rarely lift a sub-10 % candidate to victory inside four months without a seismic event → their win paths small but not zero.

Probability calibration (inside view, expressed as odds of eventually holding the presidency on 22 June 2026).

Baseline (Dec 2025) I had: Cepeda 28, Espriella 30, Fajardo 10, Valencia 7, Other 25.  
Adjustments:  
+8 pp to Espriella (recent consistent polling + runoff edge + issue salience).  
+4 pp to Cepeda (still virtually tied, strong party machine).  
–3 pp Fajardo (momentum absent).  
–1 pp Valencia (weak national numbers despite primary buzz).  
–8 pp Other (field narrowing, certifications closed).

Checklist (quick):

• Most likely = Espriella; least likely = Valencia. Consistent with evidence.  
• Key evidence: 1) Feb AtlasIntel tie/runoff edge; 2) 30 % undecided; 3) Petro 57 % disapproval; 4) March 8 primaries; 5) security concerns “Bukele effect.”  
• Blind-spot: major scandal or violence involving Espriella could collapse his support, boosting Cepeda or a consensus centrist; would swing 10–15 pp.  
• Status quo bias: keep weight on current top-two, avoid over-penalising “Other.”

Probabilities: [32, 38, 7, 6, 17]
