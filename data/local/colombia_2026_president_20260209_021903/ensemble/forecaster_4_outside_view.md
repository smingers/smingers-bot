Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Latin America Reports (05-Nov-2025).  Factual: first post-ban national poll (Cifras y Conceptos, n = 3 361).  Quality: mid-tier news-site summarising a reputable domestic pollster; survey is four months old.  Opinion quotes from Sergio Guzmán (well-known risk-analyst).  
2. Americas Quarterly (Ricardo Ávila, 27-Jan-2026).  Factual: quotes Atlas Intel’s late-January poll and macro/security indicators.  Americas Quarterly is a long-standing regional policy journal; Ávila is a named expert.  Mostly analysis, some opinion.  
3. World Politics Review (12-Jan-2026).  Broad regional article; provides no numbers, only the assertion that the race is “wide open.”  Good background, limited hard data.  
4. Colombia One (26-Dec-2025).  Factual: Invamer December poll and Polymarket prices.  Source is a small portal; Invamer is respected, Polymarket is a live real-money market.  Caveat: six weeks old.  
5. The City Paper Bogotá (13-Jan-2026).  Factual: Atlas Intel fieldwork early Jan (n ≈ 7 000).  Atlas’ online method tends to overweight urban, younger voters.  Author mixes reporting with colour commentary; nonetheless poll figures are verifiable.  
6. Agent report (09-Feb-2026).  Synthetic summary of public information up to 08 Feb 2026, including new CNE rulings and multiple January polls (Atlas, GAD-3, CNC, Guarumo).  Gives the freshest factual timeline; cites primary sources (La Silla Vacía, HSB Noticias, El País).  Reliability: good for facts, caution for any unstated assumptions.

Across sources, only the poll numbers and the CNE decision are treated as hard facts; commentary by Guzmán, Ávila, Roman, etc. is opinion, though still useful when they are identifiable experts.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate-level classes considered:  
1. Open-seat Colombian presidential elections under the 1991 Constitution that went to a first round (1994, 1998, 2002, 2010, 2018, 2022).  Six data points.  
2. All Latin-American open-seat elections since 2000 that use a majority-run-off system and occurred within ±6 months of Feb in the election year (≈25 cases).  
3. Global two-round presidential systems (≈60 cases since 2000).

Class 1 is closest: same rules, culture, parties, and historical polling environment.  It is small but the most directly relevant.  I use it as the primary reference class and sanity-check against class 2.

Patterns from class 1:  
• The ideological bloc that wins: Right 3½*; Centre 1½; Left 1 (Petro 2022).  (Santos straddles R/C in 2010, hence halves).  Fine-grained frequency → Right 50 %, Centre 25 %, Left 25 %.  
• February polling leader wins only 3/6 times (Uribe 2002, Santos 2010, Petro 2022).  So a 50 % “pre-February leader upset” rate.  
• A non-front-runner (≤10 % in February) has won once (Uribe 2002) – ≈17 % base rate for a true outsider surge.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today is 08-Feb-2026.  113 days to the first round (31-May) and 134 days to a possible run-off (21-Jun).  Historically in Colombia, the decisive turn (Duque 2018, Uribe 2002) happened during March–May after congressional/primary contests.  So we are just before the main consolidation window – plenty of time for momentum shifts.

(d) Justification (outside view)  
Step 1 – Ideological base rate: Right 50 %, Centre 25 %, Left 25 %.  
Step 2 – Map to answer options:  
   Right = De la Espriella + Valencia  
   Centre = Fajardo  
   Left = Cepeda  
Step 3 – Split the right: In five of the six reference elections, only one right-wing candidacy survived to the run-off; internal consolidation usually favours the early poll-leader.  A 70 / 30 split between the two right names is a reasonable first cut.  
   → De la Espriella 35 %, Valencia 15 %.  
Step 4 – February-leader upset factor: Cepeda and De la Espriella currently share the lead; historical 50 % upset probability implies we should keep non-leaders (Fajardo, Valencia, “Another”) materially alive.  I reallocate 10 percentage-points from the joint leaders to the trailing options proportional to their blocs.  
Step 5 – Outsider surprise: one in six Colombian cycles produced a very late outsider win (Uribe).  None of the listed “main four” count as that kind of bolt-from-the-blue; therefore I place a 10 % generic probability on “Another candidate.”

Result after adjustments (rounded to whole %):

Outside view calibration:
• Right bloc retained at 50 %, but split 35 % / 15 % for leader vs. secondary.  
• Centre bloc kept at 20 % (slightly below the 25 % base because centre has never actually won an open-seat race).  
• Left bloc set at 25 %.  
• A 10 % “wildcard” to honour the historical outsider event rate.

Outside View Prediction:
'Iván Cepeda': 25%  
'Abelardo de la Espriella': 35%  
'Sergio Fajardo': 20%  
'Paloma Valencia': 10%  
'Another candidate': 10%
