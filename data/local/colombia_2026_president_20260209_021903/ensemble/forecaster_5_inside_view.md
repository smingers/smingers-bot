Analysis
(a) Source analysis (dates ≤ 8 Feb 2026)

1. AtlasIntel/SEMANA poll (27 Jan–4 Feb 26, n =  7,298, MOE ±1). Factual: first-round 32.1 De la Espriella, 31.4 Cepeda; runoff 36.8/34.6.  Methodology published, recent, high quality.  
2. AFP & El Cronista pieces (7 Feb 26) merely re-report same Atlas numbers.  Reliable agency; duplicates data.  
3. The City Paper Bogotá (13 Jan 26) – Atlas poll of mid-Jan.  Supports rise of De la Espriella. Credible but slightly older.  
4. AS/COA (17 Dec 25) – Invamer Nov 25 poll (Cepeda 32 / Espriella 18).  Good historical baseline.  
5. CFR (9 Dec 25) – paraphrases Invamer; notes Petro’s approval 35 / 54.  Think-tank, moderate quality.  
6. Polymarket odds (7 Dec 25) – crowd prediction (Cepeda 42 %).  Thin volume, moderate at best.  
7. Semana articles on Gran Consulta (Feb 26) – factual about upcoming 8 Mar party primaries; polling shows Valencia ≤9 %.  Medium reliability, mostly descriptive.  
8. World Politics Review & WPR (Jan 26) – qualitative; “field muddled”.  Thin factual content – weak weight.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong  
• All independent February polling converges on technical tie, with >25 % undecided and high rejection of Cepeda (44 %) – directly relevant.  
• Historical pattern: since 1994, top-two in February polling have always reached runoff (8/8 cases).  
• Incumbent-backed candidate won only 1/7 opportunities since 1994 → structural anti-continuity bias.

Moderate  
• Momentum: Cepeda led by 14 pts in Nov; now trails by 0.7 → trend favours De la Espriella.  
• Right-wing may further unify after 8 Mar consultation; left already largely unified.  
• Petro net-19 disapproval likely drags Cepeda, but relationship is indirect.

Weak  
• Polymarket trades favour Cepeda (Dec 25).  Low liquidity, stale.  
• Potential scandals or newcomer surge (e.g., Vicky Dávila) are speculative.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Days to first round: 113.  Days to possible runoff: 134.  
Typical Colombian campaigns show polling swings of 5-10 pts in final 3 months (Duque 2018, Petro 2022).  If time were halved (57 d), probabilities would lean 3-4 pts more toward whoever is then leading; if doubled, reversion risk grows and tails (+“Another”) would rise ~3 pts.

(d) Justification of shifts from outside view

Base (Dec version): 44 Espriella / 30 Cepeda / 10 Fajardo / 4 Valencia / 12 Other.

Adjustments:

1. Polling tie instead of 14-pt Espriella edge → –4 Espriella, +2 Cepeda (moderate evidence).  
2. Momentum since Nov still points right → +2 Espriella (partly offset).  
3. Run-off simulations give Espriella +2.2 pts with huge undecideds (weak-moderate) → +1 Espriella.  
4. High rejection of Cepeda (+11 pts vs rival) → +2 Espriella, –2 Cepeda (strong).  
5. Prospect that Gran Consulta could crown Valencia but her ceiling <10 % → +1 Valencia, –1 Other (weak-moderate).  
6. Fajardo stagnating at ~8 % for a year → –1 Fajardo, +1 Other.

Inside-view probability calibration (rounded)

Iván Cepeda………………34  
Abelardo de la Espriella…38  
Sergio Fajardo……………8  
Paloma Valencia…………6  
Another candidate………14  
Total……………………100

Checklist
1. Options & criteria: winner printed on decisive-round ballot; election 31 May/21 Jun 26; five answer buckets.  
2. Outside view: 44/30/10/4/12.  
3. Most likely=De la Espriella 38; least likely=Valencia 6.  Consistent with evidence.  
4. Key evidence: a) Feb 26 Atlas poll tie; b) Cepeda 44 % rejection vs 34 % Espriella; c) Historical anti-incumbent bias (1/7 wins); d) Right-wing unification potential after 8 Mar; e) 30 % undecided keeps tails significant.  
5. Blind-spot: major scandal or security crisis discrediting De la Espriella, letting centrist emerge.  Would raise Fajardo/Other by >10 pts.  
6. Status-quo: tie with slight rightward drift; forecast sits close to that, modestly favouring Espriella.  
7. Numbers sum to 100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [34, 38, 8, 6, 14]
