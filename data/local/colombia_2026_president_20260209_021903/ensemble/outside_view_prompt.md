You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Who will win the 2026 presidential election in Colombia?

Question background:
With President Gustavo Petro term limited, the race to be the next president of
Colombia is wide open. The first round of Colombia's next presidential election is
scheduled for 31 May 2026, with a runoff scheduled for 21 June 2026, if needed.
If a candidate named in the answer options ceases to be a candidate, that person's
name will be replaced by the person chosen to replace that candidate under the laws
of Colombia if 1) such a replacement is named, and 2) such a replacement is not
already named in the answer options.


The options are: ['Iván Cepeda', 'Abelardo de la Espriella', 'Sergio Fajardo', 'Paloma Valencia', 'Another candidate']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
The name of the person printed on the ballot who ultimately wins will be considered
the winner of the election, even if that named candidate is replaced after the ballots
for the round that ultimately decides the winner are printed (e.g., Mel Carnahan's
"victory" in the 2000 Missouri Senate race).

# Summary of Article: "Three Upcoming Elections Offer a Cautionary Tale for Latin America"

**Source:** World Politics Review  
**Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Author:** James Bosworth

## Key Facts and Information Relevant to Colombia's 2026 Presidential Election:

### General Context:
- Three presidential elections are scheduled for the first half of 2026 in Latin America: Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia
- **Key characteristic:** Nobody knows who will win any of these elections, with candidate fields still muddled and polling inconclusive
- All three countries experienced electoral surprises in their previous presidential election cycles (4-5 years ago) that are influencing current campaigns
- The article identifies a lack of clear campaign narratives as pointing to larger problems in these countries' political systems

### Specific Information on Colombia:
- Colombia's presidential election is mentioned as one of the three upcoming elections
- President Gustavo Petro is term-limited (consistent with background information provided)
- No specific candidates, polling data, or other details about Colombia's race are provided in this article excerpt

### Comparative Context (Costa Rica example):
- The article provides detailed information about Costa Rica's election as an example of the uncertainty characterizing these races
- Costa Rica's 2022 election saw Rodrigo Chaves surge from single-digit polling (around fifth place) just two weeks before the first round to ultimately winning the presidency
- This example illustrates the potential for late-campaign surges and the unreliability of early polling in the region

**Note:** This article provides minimal specific information about Colombia's 2026 presidential race beyond confirming its timing and the general uncertainty surrounding it.

- **Abelardo De la Espriella:** 36-37% implied probability of victory (tied with Cepeda)
- **Sergio Fajardo:** ~14% odds
- Other contenders trail far behind

### Traditional Polling Data:
- **Invamer poll (published early December 2025):**
  - Ivan Cepeda: 31.9% vote share (leading)
  - Abelardo De la Espriella: 18.2% vote share (more than 13 points behind Cepeda)
  - Sergio Fajardo and other candidates lag further behind

## Candidate Profiles:

**Ivan Cepeda Castro:**
- Seasoned senator with deep roots in the left-wing Pacto Historico coalition
- Known for advocacy on human rights and progressive causes
- Seen as ideological continuation of outgoing President Gustavo Petro's political project

**Abelardo De la Espriella:**
- Lawyer and outspoken conservative voice
- Built momentum as a right-wing alternative

- Pattern of fragmentation across center and right
- Emerging "all against Cepeda" landscape
- Disparate conservative and centrist forces could rally behind single contender in runoff
- De la Espriella could consolidate right-wing factions by selecting Valencia as vice-presidential running mate, uniting coastal support with Uribe's base in conservative departments

<Agent_report>
Query: Current alliances, declared candidates, and polling data for Colombia’s 2026 presidential election; include information on Iván Cepeda, Abelardo de la Espriella, Sergio Fajardo, Paloma Valencia, and any emerging outsider candidates. Summarize key events since 2024 that have shifted support.
Since the last briefing, three new pieces of open-source evidence refine – and in one case significantly alter – the picture of Colombia’s 2026 presidential race.

1.  Candidate roster and bloc alignments (update to 9 Feb 2026)

Progressive / left  
• Iván Cepeda (Pacto Histórico) remains the de-facto government-camp nominee after winning the October 2025 internal vote. He is still barred from the 8 March “Frente por la Vida” primary but insists on registering directly for first round (La Silla Vacía, 20 Jan 2026).  
• Daniel Quintero has been re-admitted to the March primary by a 7-1 CNE ruling issued on 5 Feb 2026 (El País, 5 Feb 2026). His return partially heals the legal fight that divided the centre-left, but it also re-opens competition for non-Petrista voters inside the bloc.  
• Roy Barreras and Camilo Romero remain on the primary ballot, so the risk of a fragmented progressive vote persists.

Right / conservative  
• Abelardo de la Espriella (signatures, Defensores de la Patria) has validated five million signatures and leads national polls. He continues to refuse participation in the right-wing “Gran Consulta por Colombia”.  
• Paloma Valencia (Centro Democrático) is still the favourite to win that 8 March conservative consulta; Álvaro Uribe’s endorsement stands.  
• Other right-leaning names on the Gran Consulta ballot – Juan Carlos Pinzón, Aníbal Gaviria, Juan Daniel Oviedo, Vicky Dávila – have not withdrawn.

Centre / technocratic & regional independents  
• Sergio Fajardo confirmed an independent run and this week released a 40-page economic plan built on anti-corruption savings, a 1.5-million-job pledge and accelerated infrastructure corridors (Alianza Verde site, accessed 9 Feb 2026).  
• Juan Manuel Galán and Enrique Peñalosa continue parallel efforts without a single centrist primary.

Emerging outsider narrative  
The “outsider vs. system” framing is now part of mainstream commentary. Former senator Viviane Morales argues the next president “will be an outsider” and explicitly cites De la Espriella, journalist Vicky Dávila and statistician Juan Daniel Oviedo as embodiments of that mood (El Tiempo, 13 Oct 2025). The trope helps De la Espriella differentiate himself from Valencia and traditional Uribismo.

2.  Polling: a widening methodological split

Five legally registered national surveys have appeared since the 1 Jan lifting of the gag order; their discrepancies are large:

• Atlas Intel for Semana, 27 Jan–4 Feb (n = 7 298) – De la Espriella 32.1 %, Cepeda 31.4 %, Fajardo 8.7 %, Valencia 3.2 % (HSB Noticias, 8 Feb 2026).  
• Atlas Intel earlier quick poll, 3–7 Jan (n = 2 194) – De la Espriella 28 %, Cepeda 26.5 % (baseline used in previous memo).  
• GAD 3 for RCN, mid-Jan (telephone) – puts Cepeda clearly first and Fajardo at only 1 % (La Silla Vacía, 20 Jan 2026).  
• CNC (face-to-face) – has Cepeda leading and Fajardo back near 10 % (same source).  
• Guarumo – shows Fajardo falling to 3.9 % and a De la Espriella edge (same source).

La Silla Vacía analysed the spread and attributes it to:  
(a) different universes – some poll only “likely voters”, others all adults;  
(b) mode effects – online (Atlas), telephone (GAD 3) vs. in-person (CNC/Guarumo);  
(c) inconsistent candidate lists caused by legal uncertainty over who must be included.  
The bottom line: while De la Espriella and Cepeda consistently occupy the top two slots, the margin and the ranking change by pollster, and Fajardo’s true standing is obscured by methodological noise.

Importantly, none of the published surveys fielded work after the decisive 5 Feb CNE double-ruling (Cepeda excluded from the primary; Quintero reincorporated). Immediate post-decision sentiment therefore remains unknown.

3.  Shifting alliances and fault lines since early 2025

a)  CNE rulings, 5 Feb 2026  
• Cepeda kept off the Frente primary while Quintero was reinstated – a split verdict that angers the Pacto but energises Quintero and Barreras. The left now faces the prospect of two progressive names on the May first-round ballot unless negotiations intervene.  
b)  Security & “Bukele effect”  
• Record coca acreage and high-profile assassinations during 2025 continue to elevate public-security as the number-one voter concern, a dynamic that Atlas correlates with De la Espriella’s rise thanks to his hard-line messaging (HSB Noticias, 8 Feb 2026).  
c)  U.S. relations thaw  
• The January-February Trump-Petro détente removed a talking point from the right, potentially softening anti-government sentiment in moderate urban constituencies; however, no poll yet quantifies the impact.  
d)  Conservative consolidation scenario  
• Uribe’s blessing of Valencia plus talk of her eventually accepting a VP slot on a De la Espriella ticket keeps conservative base voters engaged in the March consulta even though their champion presently trails nationally.  
e)  Poll-law “chaos” itself becomes an event  
• La Silla Vacía reports that diverging methods and perceived legal grey zones are fuelling candidate complaints and shaping media narratives – an indirect but real influence on voter perceptions.

4.  New policy detail

• Fajardo’s newly posted economic platform spells out a three-pillar agenda (productive diversification, expanded social investment, fiscal responsibility) and offers numeric targets: 1.5 million jobs, one extra GDP point of anti-corruption revenue redeployed to education/CT&I, and fast-tracked 4G transport corridors (Alianza Verde website, accessed 9 Feb 2026).  
• No equally granular programme documents have surfaced for Valencia or De la Espriella; Valencia’s most explicit public policy line remains her January speech warning of capital flight under higher taxes (Infobae, 29 Jan 2026, previously cited).

5.  Updated race tiers

Based on the composite of polls and the new legal landscape:  
Tier 1 – Abelardo de la Espriella and Iván Cepeda, locked in a statistical tie and assured first-round ballot access.  
Tier 2 – Sergio Fajardo, oscillating between high single digits and low teens depending on pollster; still viable if he captures urban centrist abstainers.  
Tier 3 – Paloma Valencia, Daniel Quintero, Roy Barreras and minor outsiders (Oviedo, Dávila). Valencia could jump to Tier 2 if she wins the 8 March consulta and/or becomes De la Espriella’s running mate; Quintero’s revived candidacy introduces a wildcard in the progressive lane.

6.  Remaining information gaps

• Post-5 Feb opinion data are still absent; without it analysts cannot judge whether Quintero’s resurrection siphons votes from Cepeda, or whether the exclusion boosts Barreras inside the primary.  
• Vice-presidential selections are unknown for every major contender; these choices could alter coalition math, especially on the right.  
• Detailed programmes from De la Espriella (beyond punitive security rhetoric) and Valencia (beyond anti-tax signalling) are missing, limiting issue-based comparison.  
• Nationwide numbers for media-figure outsiders (Dávila, Oviedo) have only been reported inside the consulta sub-samples; broader viability is untested.

7.  Next inflection points

• 8 March – dual consultas: “Frente por la Vida” on the left and “Gran Consulta por Colombia” on the right will either consolidate or further fragment their respective camps.  
• 13 March – legal deadline for candidate filing, by which De la Espriella must present running mate and Valencia must decide on a unity formula.  
• Late March – first wave of polls after the consultas should finally capture the net effect of the CNE rulings and of any ticket mergers.

Until those data arrive, the safest conclusion is that Colombia is heading toward a highly polarised first round where an anti-establishment conservative (De la Espriella) and a government-camp progressive (Cepeda) are frontrunners, but where a centrist resurgence or a conservative fusion could still scramble the two-person run-off.</Agent_report>
