Analysis:
To forecast who is currently most likely to win Colombia’s 2026 presidential race, I need very up-to-date information on:  
• Which politicians have officially declared or withdrawn, and any new entrants.  
• Recent national polling averages or polls released in 2026.  
• Major endorsements, coalition formations, scandals or legal developments that could alter candidate viability.  
• Public sentiment toward the Petro administration and whether voters are leaning toward continuity or change.  
February-2026 news items, polling releases, and analyses from Colombian outlets will be the most informative right now, so my queries focus on those specifics.
