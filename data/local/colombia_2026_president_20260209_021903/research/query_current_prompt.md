You are currently doing research for current information/news articles on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Who will win the 2026 presidential election in Colombia?

Question background:
With President Gustavo Petro term limited, the race to be the next president of
Colombia is wide open. The first round of Colombia's next presidential election is
scheduled for 31 May 2026, with a runoff scheduled for 21 June 2026, if needed.
If a candidate named in the answer options ceases to be a candidate, that person's
name will be replaced by the person chosen to replace that candidate under the laws
of Colombia if 1) such a replacement is named, and 2) such a replacement is not
already named in the answer options.


The options are:
['Iván Cepeda', 'Abelardo de la Espriella', 'Sergio Fajardo', 'Paloma Valencia', 'Another candidate']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
The name of the person printed on the ballot who ultimately wins will be considered
the winner of the election, even if that named candidate is replaced after the ballots
for the round that ultimately decides the winner are printed (e.g., Mel Carnahan's
"victory" in the 2000 Missouri Senate race).
