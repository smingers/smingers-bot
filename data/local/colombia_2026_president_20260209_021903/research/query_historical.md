Analysis:
To build a solid outside-view baseline I first need basic historical context on the 2026 Colombian presidential race:  
• Which of the listed people (Iván Cepeda, Abelardo de la Espriella, Sergio Fajardo, Paloma Valencia) have formally declared, are leading coalitions, or are still only rumored?  
• Recent national polling and favorability trends since Petro’s 2022 victory—especially head-to-head or first-round polls.  
• Party primary calendars, coalition rules (e.g., Centro Democrático, Pacto Histórico, Coalición de la Esperanza), and any emerging “outsider” or unity candidacies that could become the “Another candidate” option.  
• Historical voting patterns (regional, ideological) and key issues that can shift support: economy, security, Petro’s approval, peace talks with ELN, etc.  
Gathering this information will let me judge the base-rates for a left-wing repeat, a right-wing restoration, a centrist win, or an outsider surge and understand how often early favorites in Colombia actually win.
