The two leading candidates are Ivan Cepeda, a 63-year-old leftist icon and son of a murdered communist, with 31.4% of vote intentions, and Abelardo De la Espriella, a 47-year-old eccentric wealthy lawyer nicknamed 'El Tigre' (The Tiger), with 32.1%. Neither candidate leads sufficiently to win outright, indicating a second round will likely occur in June. Cepeda, a philosopher and long-time human rights defender, has been a vocal critic of former right-wing president Alvaro Uribe, accusing him of ties to paramilitaries. Despite unsubstantiated claims by Uribe and the opposition that Cepeda is a proxy for the dissolved FARC guerrilla group, he played a key mediating role in the 2016 peace deal and advocates for negotiations with illegal armed groups, dignified treatment for migrants, and opposition to the war on drugs\u2014positions aligned with President Gustavo Petro. In contrast, De la Espriella, who has no political experience, promotes a hardline stance against armed groups, supports stronger military cooperation with the United States, and advocates for mega-prisons. A former opera singer and entrepreneur in wine and rum, he has gained attention for using AI to create videos of himself as a fierce feline. He has described the left as a 'cancer' and 'plague' to be eradicated, and in November declared, 'I am the tiger, and that is why I stand before you like a ferocious beast, ready to defend Colombia at the risk of my life if necessary.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 05:52 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/96HV966)\n\n**2026 Colombian Presidential Race: Cepeda and De la Espriella in Technical Deadlock Amid High Rejection Rates**\nThe 2026 Colombian presidential race is shaping up as a tightly contested battle between leftist senator Iv\u00e1n Cepeda, representing the Historic Pact (Pacto Hist\u00f3rico) and allied with President Gustavo Petro, and right-wing lawyer Abelardo de la Espriella of the Defensores de la Patria movement. According to a survey conducted by Brazilian firm AtlasIntel and published by Semana magazine, De la Espriella leads with 32.1% of voting intention, while Cepeda trails at 31.4%, within a 1% margin of error, indicating a technical tie. The survey, based on 7,298 respondents from January 27 to February 4, 2026, confirms a trend from recent polls showing both candidates as frontrunners. In a hypothetical runoff, De la Espriella could defeat Cepeda (36.8% vs. 34.6%), but in all other scenarios, Cepeda would prevail. Indecisive voters or those planning to vote blank account for approximately 30% of respondents, a potentially decisive factor. Both candidates face high rejection rates\u201443.9% for Cepeda and 33.6% for De la Espriella\u2014with 22.5% rejecting both. Neither Cepeda nor De la Espriella will participate in the March 8, 2026, party consultations, which will bring together 16 presidential candidates from the center-right, left, and center-left to consolidate nominations ahead of the May 31, 2026, general election.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 04:37 PM\nSource:[El Cronista](https://www.cronista.com/colombia/actualidad-co/elecciones-2026-nueva-encuesta-anticipa-una-disputa-presidencial-cerrada-entre-cepeda-y-de-la-espriella/)\n\n**Reconciliation in Sight: Vicky D\u00e1vila and Abelardo de la Espriella Cross Tweets on Unity to Defeat Cepeda**\nColombian presidential elections are set for May 31, 2026, with polling showing a tight race between Abelardo de la Espriella and Iv\u00e1n Cepeda, who lead the field ahead of other candidates such as Sergio Fajardo, Paloma Valencia, and Claudia L\u00f3pez. According to an AtlasIntel survey conducted between January 27 and February 4, 2026, with a sample of 7,298 people and a 1% margin of error, Paloma Valencia leads the Gran Consulta por Colombia (a pre-selection process for the right and center-right bloc) with 26.9%, followed by Vicky D\u00e1vila at 15.4%, a doubling of her support from 7% in January. D\u00e1vila stated on social media: 'We are going to win #LaGranConsulta, but we will be responsible with the country. If we have to unite to defeat Iv\u00e1n Cepeda, we will unite. We cannot repeat the mistake of the Venezuelans, who took 27 years to begin recovering their country.' Her message prompted a response from Abelardo de la Espriella, who had previously dismissed her as an 'unviable candidate,' saying: 'That's right, Vicky: the only enemy of democracy, freedom, and institutional stability is Cepeda. We must defeat him! Strong embrace.' This exchange suggests a potential reconciliation between the two. The survey results reflect a highly competitive political landscape with significant shifts in voter intent, particularly for D\u00e1vila.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 04:28 PM\nSource:[Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo](https://www.semana.com/politica/articulo/reconciliacion-a-la-vista-vicky-davila-y-abelardo-de-la-espriella-se-cruzan-trinos-sobre-la-importancia-de-la-unidad-para-derrotar-a-cepeda/202628/)\n\n**Abelardo de la Espriella and Iv\u00e1n Cepeda Lead Colombian Presidential Race in AtlasIntel Survey**\nAccording to a February 7, 2026, survey by AtlasIntel for Semana, Abelardo de la Espriella and Iv\u00e1n Cepeda are the leading candidates in Colombia's upcoming presidential election, with a technical tie in first-round intentions: 32.1% for de la Espriella and 31.4% for Cepeda. The survey, based on 7,298 in-person interviews nationwide, projects a potential runoff on June 21, 2026, if no candidate secures an absolute majority on May 31, 2026. In a hypothetical runoff, de la Espriella would narrowly defeat Cepeda (36.8% vs. 34.6%). Cepeda leads in the Caribbean and Pacific regions and among voters aged 18\u201324, while de la Espriella performs strongest in Bogot\u00e1, the Central region, Orinoqu\u00eda, and Amazon\u00eda, with stronger support among voters aged 45\u201359. Third-party candidates\u2014Sergio Fajardo (7.6%), Paloma Valencia (3.8%), Claudia L\u00f3pez (3.7%)\u2014and others fail to surpass 10% of support. The vote for blank ballots stands at 5.3%, undecided voters at 7.7%, and non-voters at 3.9%. In a scenario where Valencia becomes the candidate after the March 8, 2026, Gran Consulta, her support rises to 8.7%, still below the leaders. Among the top four candidates (Cepeda, de la Espriella, Fajardo, Valencia), Cepeda leads with 35.1%, followed by de la Espriella at 34.4%, and Fajardo at 13.2%. In second-round simulations, Cepeda defeats Juan Carlos Pinz\u00f3n (35.8% vs. 18.8%) and Paloma Valencia (35.2% vs. 26.9%), and also beats Fajardo (33.7% vs. 26.2%). De la Espriella beats Fajardo (31.8% vs. 21.7%). Rejection levels are high: 43.9% reject Cepeda, 33.6% reject de la Espriella, and 22.5% reject both, indicating significant polarization.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 03:56 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/colombia/2026/02/07/abelardo-de-la-espriella-e-ivan-cepeda-son-los-favoritos-en-las-proximas-elecciones-presidenciales-segun-la-encuesta-de-atlasintel/)\n\n**A Petro Disciple and a Millionaire Lawyer: The Frontrunners in Colombia\u2019s 2026 Presidential Race**\nIn Colombia\u2019s upcoming presidential election on May 31, 2026, two contrasting frontrunners are Iv\u00e1n Cepeda, a 63-year-old leftist human rights defender and son of murdered communist politician Manuel Cepeda, and Abelardo De la Espriella, a 47-year-old wealthy lawyer and self-proclaimed 'El Tigre' with no political experience. According to an AtlasIntel survey published on February 7, 2026, Cepeda leads with 31.4% support, narrowly behind De la Espriella at 32.1%, indicating a technical tie. Cepeda, a philosopher and long-time activist, is known for his role in Colombia\u2019s 2016 peace process with the FARC and his historic 2023 conviction of former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe\u2014later annulled\u2014on paramilitary links. He advocates for negotiations with armed groups, humane treatment of migrants, and criticizes the war on drugs, aligning closely with President Gustavo Petro. Cepeda\u2019s political journey began after his father\u2019s 1994 assassination during a campaign of violence against the left; he has since become a symbol of resilience, stating, 'I have survived genocide, stigmatization, and relentless persecution. And here I stand, ready to triumph.' De la Espriella, a former resident of Italy, is known for representing high-profile clients including paramilitaries, drug traffickers, and football star James Rodr\u00edguez. He promotes a hardline stance against crime, supports gun ownership, stronger U.S. military alliances, and the construction of mega-prisons. He has called the left a 'cancer' and 'plague to eradicate,' drawing criticism in a nation scarred by decades of violence. His public image is shaped by flamboyant appearances\u2014opera singing, tailored suits, sunglasses\u2014and AI-generated videos depicting him as a feline warrior. He faces scrutiny over his wealth and past defense of Alex Saab, a businessman linked to Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, which he denies as purely professional. With neither candidate securing enough votes for a first-round victory, a runoff election in June 2026 is expected.

However, accounting for undecided voters, her support drops to 7.6%. This indicates that even if she wins the consultation, she lacks sufficient momentum to challenge the leading candidates.

Despite being excluded from the consultation by the National Electoral Council (CNE), Iv\u00e1n Cepeda\u2014top candidate in most polls and leader of the Historic Pact\u2014has united the leftist petrista sector around his candidacy, rendering Barreras' consultation less influential. Barreras, who lacks support from President Gustavo Petro and key allies like Luis Gilberto Murillo and Juan Fernando Cristo, has restructured his coalition to include Daniel Quintero and others, but remains isolated from the broader progressive movement. He has proposed a strategic plan: if he wins the March 8 consultation, he could either run directly in the first round or become Cepeda\u2019s vice-presidential candidate, depending on vote comparisons. However, legal risks loom\u2014under Law 1475 of 2011, failure to follow consultation results could require returning nearly 300 billion pesos in electoral costs. Barreras acknowledges he is not Petro\u2019s preferred candidate and admits he cannot compete with the state apparatus behind Petro. His strategy hinges on capitalizing on voter turnout for the March 8 congressional elections to gain political leverage, but without Petro\u2019s backing or a broad coalition, his path remains uncertain. Critics argue his actions risk fracturing the progressive movement, and his exclusion of major figures like Murillo and Cristo underscores the fragility of his coalition.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 07:28 AM\nSource:[Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo](https://www.semana.com/politica/articulo/el-huracan-roy-las-ultimas-movidas-del-candidato-presidencial-que-dividio-a-la-izquierda-petrista-e-irrito-a-ivan-cepeda/202637/)\n\n**2026 Colombian Presidential Election: Registration of Candidates Begins**\nThe registration period for presidential candidates in Colombia's 2026 elections has officially begun, with the election scheduled for May 31, 2026. The winner will succeed Gustavo Petro as president. According to the National Registry of Civil Status (Registradur\u00eda), 15 precandidates have been officially certified after meeting the required signature threshold from 91 registered candidacy committees\u2014only 22 of which received support from the Registradur\u00eda, with 15 ultimately achieving certification. The registration window ran from January 31 to March 13, 2026, and includes political parties, political movements, citizen groups, coalitions, and blank vote promoters. If candidates are selected through consultations on March 8, 2026, registration can occur within five business days after the results are published, per Law 1475 of 2011. As of February 2, 2026, only one candidate has officially registered: Senator Clara L\u00f3pez Obreg\u00f3n, who announced her candidacy on social media platform X, stating she did so alongside leaders from the Esperanza Democr\u00e1tica party and the Partido TSC. Candidates must schedule an appointment via email to jjrocha@registraduria.gov.co, with a copy to mapinto@registraduria.gov.co, and submit formal documentation in advance to verify eligibility.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:51 PM\nSource:[www.eluniversal.com.co](https://www.eluniversal.com.co/politica/2026/02/02/elecciones-2026-comenzo-la-inscripcion-de-candidatos-presidenciales/)\n\n**Abelardo de la Espriella Says Colombia's Presidential Race Is a Two-Horse Contest: 'It Will Be Between Cepeda and Me'**\nAbelardo de la Espriella, the opposition presidential candidate for Colombia's Defensores de la Patria movement, stated in an interview with CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on January 22, 2026, that the upcoming presidential election will be a two-candidate race between himself and Iv\u00e1n Cepeda, the officialist candidate representing the left-wing Pacto Hist\u00f3rico coalition. De la Espriella claimed he has risen to second place in several polls within six months and is in a 'technical tie' with Cepeda when averaging survey results. He described the political landscape as highly polarized, noting that all polls place him and Cepeda first and second, with the third-place candidate far behind. De la Espriella positioned himself as a political 'phenomenon' rather than a traditional candidate, emphasizing he has never held public office, has no state contracts, and is not part of the 'usual political elite.' He criticized Cepeda as the 'heir of Petro' and blamed him for the 'government disaster' currently facing Colombia. The election will begin with a first round on May 31, 2026, and if no candidate secures enough votes, a runoff will be held on June 21, 2026. The winner will assume the presidency on August 7, 2026.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 03:30 AM\nSource:[KTVZ.com](https://ktvz.com/cnn-spanish/2026/01/21/abelardo-de-la-espriella-dice-que-la-eleccion-en-colombia-sera-una-carrera-de-dos-esto-va-a-ser-entre-el-senor-cepeda-y-yo/)\n\n**2026 Colombian Presidential Elections: The 'Gran Consulta' Gains Momentum with Nine Candidates**\nThe 'Gran Consulta por Colombia' for the 2026 presidential elections has gained momentum with nine candidates now officially participating, including Juan Carlos Pinz\u00f3n, who joined as the ninth candidate on the center-right spectrum. This marks a record number of aspirants in a single Colombian consultation. Sergio Fajardo and Abelardo de la Espriella remain outside the process, though their names are still prominent in political discourse, echoing \u00c1lvaro Uribe\u2019s earlier phrase 'De Fajardo hasta Abelardo'. Analysts predict that by the May 31, 2026, first-round presidential election, only four candidates are likely to remain viable: the winner of the left-wing Frente Amplio consultation (between Iv\u00e1n Cepeda and Roy Barreras), the winner of the 'Gran Consulta', and possibly Fajardo and De la Espriella if they do not join another consultation. Participating in the consultation is seen as a strategic move, historically proven to boost visibility and legitimacy\u2014benefits demonstrated by past leaders like Juan Manuel Santos, Iv\u00e1n Duque, and Gustavo Petro. However, experts caution that winning a consultation does not guarantee presidential victory, citing Petro\u2019s 2018 win (2,853,731 votes) and Federico Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s 2022 loss despite a strong showing. The 'Gran Consulta' coincides with legislative elections, potentially amplifying its impact: in 2022, the Liberal, Conservative, Centro Democr\u00e1tico, and Cambio Radical parties collectively received nearly 8 million votes (46.56% of the Senate vote), providing a substantial base for any winning candidate. Experts like political strategist Miguel Jaramillo Luj\u00e1n and political scientist Guillermo Henao emphasize that consultations function as a 'first round'\u2014offering media visibility, voter recognition, and coalition-building opportunities. While they do not guarantee victory, they serve as a political certification of competitiveness. Fajardo and De la Espriella face a strategic dilemma: staying out avoids early exposure but risks irrelevance, while joining may fragment the vote. The Frente Amplio, meanwhile, benefits from unified left-wing support, executive backing, and a complementary mix of 'opinion' (Cepeda) and 'machine' (Barreras) votes. Ultimately, the consultation winner may not win the presidency, but they will earn the critical advantage of being taken seriously in the race.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 03:18 AM\nSource:[www.elcolombiano.com](https://www.elcolombiano.com/colombia/elecciones-2026-coge-fuerza-la-gran-consulta-con-nueve-candidatos-DF32376104)\n\n**Iv\u00e1n Cepeda Emerges as Favorite to Win Colombia's 2026 Presidential Election According to Polymarket**\nAccording to Polymarket, a U.S.-based prediction platform that uses blockchain and cryptocurrency-based betting, Iv\u00e1n Cepeda, the senator from the Historic Pact and its 2026 presidential candidate, is now the frontrunner for Colombia's presidency, with a 42% probability of winning.

The vote was held on October 27, 2025, with over 2.75 million participants, marking a significant turnout for an internal party process. Cepeda defeated former Health Minister Carolina Corcho by nearly 37 percentage points. He will now face other center-left candidates in a consolidation process expected to begin in March 2026, involving representatives of what is known as the Frente Amplio. President Gustavo Petro praised the results, stating they demonstrate that the Pacto Hist\u00f3rico has more voters than most traditional political parties during actual election periods. He emphasized that the next step is to build a 'winning broad front candidacy' and a 'majority absolute Congress' capable of approving a National Constituent Assembly to ensure the full implementation of constitutional rights for Colombians.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[AVN](https://avn.info.ve/ivan-cepeda-gano-la-consulta-del-pacto-historico-y-se-convierte-en-candidato-presencial-en-colombia/)\n\n**Colombia's left picks Ivan Cepeda as 2026 presidential candidate**\nIvan Cepeda, a 63-year-old Colombian senator, was elected as the left's 2026 presidential candidate by the Historic Pact, a leftist coalition that brought President Gustavo Petro to power in 2022. Cepeda won the primary with 1.02 million votes (64.4%), defeating former Health Minister Carolina Corcho, who received 472,062 votes (29.5%), with 88% of votes counted. The primary saw low turnout, despite a potential electorate of 41.2 million registered voters as reported by the National Civil Registry. The Electoral Council will decide in the coming weeks whether Cepeda can participate in a broader interparty referendum in March 2026, where candidates from various political parties will compete to represent a wider segment of the left and center. Most political parties are scheduled to hold their primaries in March, alongside legislative elections. Colombians will vote in May 2026 to elect Petro's successor, with a runoff possible in June if no candidate secures a majority.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 11:46 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/Colombias-left-picks-Ivan-Cepeda-as-2026-presidential-candidate)\n\n**Iv\u00e1n Cepeda and Carolina Corcho Vie for Presidential Nomination in Historic Pacto Hist\u00f3rico Consultation**\nOn Sunday, October 25, 2025, Senator Iv\u00e1n Cepeda and former Health Minister Carolina Corcho will compete in a consultation to determine the official presidential candidate for the 2026 elections of the Pacto Hist\u00f3rico, the leftist coalition that brought President Gustavo Petro to power in 2022. The winner will advance to a March 2026 inter-party primary within the Frente Amplio to secure a unified left-wing candidate for the presidential election. Cepeda, a 63-year-old philosopher and former peace negotiator with the FARC and ELN, is known for his role in the prosecution of former President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, though he was recently absolved in second instance by the Bogot\u00e1 Superior Court, which may diminish his status as an anti-Uribista hero. Corcho, a psychiatrist born in 1983, served as Health Minister from August 2022 to April 2023 and is recognized for leading Petro\u2019s controversial health reform, which critics argue caused chaos in Colombia\u2019s previously strong healthcare system, especially during the Iv\u00e1n Duque administration\u2019s pandemic response. The consultation also determines the order of the Pacto Hist\u00f3rico\u2019s lists for the Senate and Chamber of Representatives ahead of the March 8, 2026 legislative elections and the May 31, 2026 first round of the presidential election, with a potential runoff on June 21. The consultation, organized by the Registradur\u00eda Nacional del Estado Civil and the Consejo Nacional Electoral, is the only one scheduled for October 26, 2025, and is open to all 39 million registered voters, not just party members. Over 20,000 voting stations have been set up nationwide to ensure broad access. Initially, several prominent leftist figures\u2014including Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Pizarro, Gloria Fl\u00f3rez, Gloria In\u00e9s Ram\u00edrez, Susana Muhamad, Gustavo Bol\u00edvar, Al\u00ed Bant\u00fa Ashanti, and Daniel Quintero\u2014had entered the race but withdrew, citing concerns about their ability to run in the inter-party primary if they lost. Quintero\u2019s withdrawal was strategic, as losing would bar him from running under another party, allowing him to remain in the race later. President Petro is expected to attend the event. The results are legally binding: the winner becomes the official precandidate, while the loser cannot register under another party.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 06:55 PM\nSource:[PanAm Post](https://panampost.com/panam-staff/2025/10/25/ivan-cepeda-y-carolina-corcho-definen-el-rumbo-del-petrismo-este-domingo/)\n\n**Iv\u00e1n Cepeda and Carolina Corcho to Compete for 2026 Presidential Candidacy in Colombia\u2019s Left-Wing Consultation**\nOn October 25, 2025, Iv\u00e1n Cepeda and Carolina Corcho competed in a consultation to determine the 2026 presidential candidate for the Pacto Hist\u00f3rico, the left-wing coalition that brought Gustavo Petro to power in 2022. The winner will advance to a March 2026 interparty contest within the Frente Amplio to secure a unified left-wing candidate for the presidential election. Cepeda, a 63-year-old philosopher and senator, is a key figure in Colombia\u2019s peace process, having served as copresident of the Senate\u2019s Peace Commission and as a negotiator with the ELN. He is the son of Manuel Cepeda Vargas, a UP politician assassinated in 1994 during a wave of violence against the party, which was founded in 1985 as part of a peace initiative by President Belisario Betancur. Cepeda has also been a victim in a corruption case involving former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe. Corcho, a 1983-born physician and psychiatrist, served as Minister of Health from August 2022 to April 2023 under Petro\u2019s government and was a central figure in the controversial health reform. The consultation also determined the order of candidates for the Senate and Chamber of Representatives in the 2026 legislative elections. Only the Pacto Hist\u00f3rico held the vote, with other parties withdrawing. Initially, several prominent left-wing figures, including Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Pizarro, Gloria Fl\u00f3rez, Gloria In\u00e9s Ram\u00edrez, Susana Muhamad, Gustavo Bol\u00edvar, Al\u00ed Bant\u00fa Ashanti, and Daniel Quintero, had entered but later withdrew, citing concerns about eligibility for the interparty process. The results are legally binding: the winner becomes the official presidential candidate of the participating parties, and the loser cannot run under another party.
