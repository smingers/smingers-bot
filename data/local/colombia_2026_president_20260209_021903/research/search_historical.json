Summarize key events since 2024 that have shifted support.\nSince the last briefing, three new pieces of open-source evidence refine \u2013 and in one case significantly alter \u2013 the picture of Colombia\u2019s 2026 presidential race.\n\n1.  Candidate roster and bloc alignments (update to 9 Feb 2026)\n\nProgressive / left  \n\u2022 Iv\u00e1n Cepeda (Pacto Hist\u00f3rico) remains the de-facto government-camp nominee after winning the October 2025 internal vote. He is still barred from the 8 March \u201cFrente por la Vida\u201d primary but insists on registering directly for first round (La Silla Vac\u00eda, 20 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Daniel Quintero has been re-admitted to the March primary by a 7-1 CNE ruling issued on 5 Feb 2026 (El Pa\u00eds, 5 Feb 2026). His return partially heals the legal fight that divided the centre-left, but it also re-opens competition for non-Petrista voters inside the bloc.  \n\u2022 Roy Barreras and Camilo Romero remain on the primary ballot, so the risk of a fragmented progressive vote persists.\n\nRight / conservative  \n\u2022 Abelardo de la Espriella (signatures, Defensores de la Patria) has validated five million signatures and leads national polls. He continues to refuse participation in the right-wing \u201cGran Consulta por Colombia\u201d.  \n\u2022 Paloma Valencia (Centro Democr\u00e1tico) is still the favourite to win that 8 March conservative consulta; \u00c1lvaro Uribe\u2019s endorsement stands.  \n\u2022 Other right-leaning names on the Gran Consulta ballot \u2013 Juan Carlos Pinz\u00f3n, An\u00edbal Gaviria, Juan Daniel Oviedo, Vicky D\u00e1vila \u2013 have not withdrawn.\n\nCentre / technocratic & regional independents  \n\u2022 Sergio Fajardo confirmed an independent run and this week released a 40-page economic plan built on anti-corruption savings, a 1.5-million-job pledge and accelerated infrastructure corridors (Alianza Verde site, accessed 9 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Juan Manuel Gal\u00e1n and Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa continue parallel efforts without a single centrist primary.\n\nEmerging outsider narrative  \nThe \u201coutsider vs. system\u201d framing is now part of mainstream commentary. Former senator Viviane Morales argues the next president \u201cwill be an outsider\u201d and explicitly cites De la Espriella, journalist Vicky D\u00e1vila and statistician Juan Daniel Oviedo as embodiments of that mood (El Tiempo, 13 Oct 2025). The trope helps De la Espriella differentiate himself from Valencia and traditional Uribismo.\n\n2.  Polling: a widening methodological split\n\nFive legally registered national surveys have appeared since the 1 Jan lifting of the gag order; their discrepancies are large:\n\n\u2022 Atlas Intel for Semana, 27 Jan\u20134 Feb (n = 7 298) \u2013 De la Espriella 32.1 %, Cepeda 31.4 %, Fajardo 8.7 %, Valencia 3.2 % (HSB Noticias, 8 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Atlas Intel earlier quick poll, 3\u20137 Jan (n = 2 194) \u2013 De la Espriella 28 %, Cepeda 26.5 % (baseline used in previous memo).  \n\u2022 GAD 3 for RCN, mid-Jan (telephone) \u2013 puts Cepeda clearly first and Fajardo at only 1 % (La Silla Vac\u00eda, 20 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 CNC (face-to-face) \u2013 has Cepeda leading and Fajardo back near 10 % (same source).  \n\u2022 Guarumo \u2013 shows Fajardo falling to 3.9 % and a De la Espriella edge (same source).\n\nLa Silla Vac\u00eda analysed the spread and attributes it to:  \n(a) different universes \u2013 some poll only \u201clikely voters\u201d, others all adults;  \n(b) mode effects \u2013 online (Atlas), telephone (GAD 3) vs. in-person (CNC/Guarumo);  \n(c) inconsistent candidate lists caused by legal uncertainty over who must be included.  \nThe bottom line: while De la Espriella and Cepeda consistently occupy the top two slots, the margin and the ranking change by pollster, and Fajardo\u2019s true standing is obscured by methodological noise.\n\nImportantly, none of the published surveys fielded work after the decisive 5 Feb CNE double-ruling (Cepeda excluded from the primary; Quintero reincorporated). Immediate post-decision sentiment therefore remains unknown.\n\n3.  Shifting alliances and fault lines since early 2025\n\na)  CNE rulings, 5 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 Cepeda kept off the Frente primary while Quintero was reinstated \u2013 a split verdict that angers the Pacto but energises Quintero and Barreras. The left now faces the prospect of two progressive names on the May first-round ballot unless negotiations intervene.  \nb)  Security & \u201cBukele effect\u201d  \n\u2022 Record coca acreage and high-profile assassinations during 2025 continue to elevate public-security as the number-one voter concern, a dynamic that Atlas correlates with De la Espriella\u2019s rise thanks to his hard-line messaging (HSB Noticias, 8 Feb 2026).  \nc)  U.S. relations thaw  \n\u2022 The January-February Trump-Petro d\u00e9tente removed a talking point from the right, potentially softening anti-government sentiment in moderate urban constituencies; however, no poll yet quantifies the impact.  \nd)  Conservative consolidation scenario  \n\u2022 Uribe\u2019s blessing of Valencia plus talk of her eventually accepting a VP slot on a De la Espriella ticket keeps conservative base voters engaged in the March consulta even though their champion presently trails nationally.  \ne)  Poll-law \u201cchaos\u201d itself becomes an event  \n\u2022 La Silla Vac\u00eda reports that diverging methods and perceived legal grey zones are fuelling candidate complaints and shaping media narratives \u2013 an indirect but real influence on voter perceptions.\n\n4.  New policy detail\n\n\u2022 Fajardo\u2019s newly posted economic platform spells out a three-pillar agenda (productive diversification, expanded social investment, fiscal responsibility) and offers numeric targets: 1.5 million jobs, one extra GDP point of anti-corruption revenue redeployed to education/CT&I, and fast-tracked 4G transport corridors (Alianza Verde website, accessed 9 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 No equally granular programme documents have surfaced for Valencia or De la Espriella; Valencia\u2019s most explicit public policy line remains her January speech warning of capital flight under higher taxes (Infobae, 29 Jan 2026, previously cited).\n\n5.  Updated race tiers\n\nBased on the composite of polls and the new legal landscape:  \nTier 1 \u2013 Abelardo de la Espriella and Iv\u00e1n Cepeda, locked in a statistical tie and assured first-round ballot access.  \nTier 2 \u2013 Sergio Fajardo, oscillating between high single digits and low teens depending on pollster; still viable if he captures urban centrist abstainers.  \nTier 3 \u2013 Paloma Valencia, Daniel Quintero, Roy Barreras and minor outsiders (Oviedo, D\u00e1vila). Valencia could jump to Tier 2 if she wins the 8 March consulta and/or becomes De la Espriella\u2019s running mate; Quintero\u2019s revived candidacy introduces a wildcard in the progressive lane.\n\n6.  Remaining information gaps\n\n\u2022 Post-5 Feb opinion data are still absent; without it analysts cannot judge whether Quintero\u2019s resurrection siphons votes from Cepeda, or whether the exclusion boosts Barreras inside the primary.  \n\u2022 Vice-presidential selections are unknown for every major contender; these choices could alter coalition math, especially on the right.  \n\u2022 Detailed programmes from De la Espriella (beyond punitive security rhetoric) and Valencia (beyond anti-tax signalling) are missing, limiting issue-based comparison.  \n\u2022 Nationwide numbers for media-figure outsiders (D\u00e1vila, Oviedo) have only been reported inside the consulta sub-samples; broader viability is untested.\n\n7.  Next inflection points\n\n\u2022 8 March \u2013 dual consultas: \u201cFrente por la Vida\u201d on the left and \u201cGran Consulta por Colombia\u201d on the right will either consolidate or further fragment their respective camps.  \n\u2022 13 March \u2013 legal deadline for candidate filing, by which De la Espriella must present running mate and Valencia must decide on a unity formula.  \n\u2022 Late March \u2013 first wave of polls after the consultas should finally capture the net effect of the CNE rulings and of any ticket mergers.\n\nUntil those data arrive, the safest conclusion is that Colombia is heading toward a highly polarised first round where an anti-establishment conservative (De la Espriella) and a government-camp progressive (Cepeda) are frontrunners, but where a centrist resurgence or a conservative fusion could still scramble the two-person run-off.</Agent_report>\n"
