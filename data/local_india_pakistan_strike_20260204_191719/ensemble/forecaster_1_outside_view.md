(b) Reference Class Analysis:

3. Terrorist Attack Response Scenarios

Most Suitable Reference Class: India-Pakistan Cross-Border Military Strikes
- Specific to the bilateral relationship
- Accounts for unique historical and geopolitical context
- Reflects recent escalation patterns

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: Approximately 22 months from current date
- Historical Pattern: Conflicts typically emerge within 6-18 months after significant terrorist incidents
- Recent Escalation: May 2025 crisis sets recent precedent for potential future strikes

(d) Justification Factors:
1. Ongoing Kashmir Tensions
2. Recent Terrorist Attacks
3. Escalating Military Rhetoric
4. Breakdown of Diplomatic Channels
5. Nationalist Sentiments
6. Technological Advancements in Military Capabilities

Key Observations:
- Terrorist attacks have historically triggered military responses
- Both countries have demonstrated willingness to conduct cross-border strikes
- International mediation has temporarily reduced tensions
- Underlying structural conflicts remain unresolved

Outside view calibration:
- Historical frequency of cross-border strikes: Approximately 1-2 significant incidents per decade
- Recent escalation suggests increased probability
- Nuclear deterrence provides counterbalance to full-scale conflict
- International diplomatic pressure acts as a moderating factor

Probability Considerations:
- Base rate of cross-border strikes
- Increased tensions post-2025 incident
- Potential for miscalculation
- Domestic political pressures

Outside View Prediction:
37%

Rationale: The prediction reflects a significant but not overwhelming probability of a cross-border military strike. The 37% accounts for:
- Historical patterns of conflict
- Recent escalation in May 2025
- Ongoing tensions
- Nuclear deterrence
- International diplomatic pressures

The prediction suggests a meaningful chance of conflict while recognizing the complex factors that might prevent an actual strike.
