- Unverified claims of foreign support for militant groups

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Window: 9 months (February 2026 to November 2026)
- If timeframe halved: Probability would likely decrease due to less time for escalation
- If timeframe doubled: Probability might increase due to more potential trigger events

(d) Justification Factors:
1. Escalation Triggers:
- Terrorist attacks remain primary provocation
- Increasing nationalist rhetoric
- Unresolved Kashmir dispute

2. Deterrence Mechanisms:
- Nuclear capabilities
- International mediation pressure
- Economic considerations

Probability calibration:
- Base rate from previous analysis: 17%
- Current evidence suggests slight increase in tension
- Specific resolution criteria remain restrictive
- Nuclear deterrence remains a strong limiting factor

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: India or Pakistan military strike in each other's territory (excluding Kashmir) causing 2+ fatalities before 28 Nov 2026
2. Base rate consistently applied
3. 17/100 times, a military strike meeting all criteria would occur
4. Key evidence:
   - May 2025 Operation Sindoor precedent
   - Ongoing terrorist tensions
   - Diplomatic instability
5. Blind spot: Unexpected major terrorist attack triggering immediate retaliation
