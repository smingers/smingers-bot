(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- CFR report predicting moderate to high conflict likelihood
- Repeated terrorist incidents and cross-border tensions
- Historical pattern of military escalations (e.g., May 2025 conflict)

Moderate Evidence:
- Diplomatic interactions suggesting potential de-escalation
- Ongoing terrorist activities in Balochistan
- Nationalist rhetoric from political leaders

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative media predictions
- Short-term diplomatic gestures

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Period: Approximately 22 months from current date
- If timeframe halved (11 months): Lower probability due to less time for escalation
- If timeframe doubled (44 months): Higher probability due to increased potential for incident accumulation

(d) Justification Factors:
- Unresolved Kashmir dispute
- Persistent terrorist activities
- Nationalist political rhetoric
- Recent military confrontations (May 2025)
- Ongoing regional instability

Probability calibration:
- Base rate of similar historical incidents: Low to moderate
- Increased tensions from 2025 conflict
- Specific resolution criteria narrow potential matches
- Balancing diplomatic efforts with ongoing regional instability

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: India or Pakistan military strike in each other's territory (excluding Kashmir) causing 2+ fatalities before Nov 28, 2026
2. Base rate: Previously established at ~17%
3. Consistency: 17 out of 100 times, a cross-border military strike occurs
4. Key Evidence:
   - CFR report predicting conflict
   - May 2025 military confrontation
   - Ongoing terrorist activities
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough or major international mediation
6. Status Quo: Tendency towards maintaining current tensions without full-scale conflict

Probability: 19%

Rationale: Slight increase from previous 17% due to recent Balochistan incidents and continued regional tensions, but still reflecting the inherent constraints on full-scale military confrontation.
