5. Nuclear Deterrence Dynamics
6. International Mediation Capabilities

Outside view calibration:
- Historical frequency of cross-border strikes
- Intensity of recent 2025 conflict
- Presence of ongoing tensions
- Nuclear deterrence preventing full-scale war
- International mediation efforts

Calibration Considerations:
- Multiple sources indicate high tension
- Conflict cycles typically involve limited strikes
- Nuclear deterrence reduces full-scale war probability
- Diplomatic channels remain partially open

Tethering to Source Data:
- May 2025 conflict involved strikes resulting in ~47 total fatalities
- Multiple cross-border incidents in recent years
- Suggests non-zero but limited strike probability

Outside View Prediction:
17% probability of India or Pakistan executing a military strike within the other's territory (excluding Kashmir) resulting in 2+ fatalities before 28 November 2026.

Rationale: The prediction reflects the complex dynamics of India-Pakistan relations, acknowledging both the high tensions and the restraining factors of nuclear deterrence and international mediation. The 17% represents a significant but not overwhelming likelihood of a limited military strike.
