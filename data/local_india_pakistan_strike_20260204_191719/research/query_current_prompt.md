Question background:
On 22 April 2025, militants in Indian-administered Kashmir killed dozens of tourists
in the worst attack in the region in years, with India and Pakistan exchanging strikes
in May 2025. This question asks whether the national military forces, militia, and/or
law enforcement personnel (Forces) of India or Pakistan will execute a military strike
or strikes within the territory of the other, excluding Kashmiri territory, resulting
in two or more fatalities before 28 November 2026.
