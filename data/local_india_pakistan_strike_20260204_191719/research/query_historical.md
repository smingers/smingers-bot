Analysis:
This forecasting question centers on potential military escalation between India and Pakistan, specifically outside Kashmir. The background suggests a significant terrorist attack in Kashmir in April 2025 that led to exchanges of strikes in May 2025, creating a heightened tension scenario. To assess the likelihood of a future military strike, we need historical context on:
1. Recent India-Pakistan military conflicts and tensions
2. Historical patterns of military responses to terrorist attacks
3. Geopolitical dynamics and potential trigger points for cross-border military action
4. Current state of diplomatic relations between the two countries

The key is to understand the historical precedents of military strikes, the threshold for retaliation, and the current geopolitical climate that might increase or decrease the probability of such an event.
