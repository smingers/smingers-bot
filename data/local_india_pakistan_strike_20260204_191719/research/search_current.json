According to an army statement, two militants were killed in Basantgarh, in the southern part of the disputed territory, after an exchange of fire that began on Tuesday. The militants had taken shelter in a natural cave, which soldiers subsequently destroyed using explosives, a security official told AFP anonymously. A third suspected rebel was killed in the high-altitude Kishtwar region, where troops were searching for a group of fighters reportedly seen in the Himalayan forests since the previous week. Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region, has been divided between India and Pakistan since 1947, with both claiming the territory in full. Armed insurgency against Indian rule has persisted since 1989, with rebel groups seeking independence or merger with Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the rebels, a claim denied by Islamabad. The conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, predominantly civilians.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 03:34 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/964Z79E)\n\n**Three days of bloody conflict in the desert! The army has retaken the town, dozens have died.**\nA series of coordinated terrorist attacks by the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) in Pakistan resulted in 58 fatalities, including 22 security personnel, across multiple cities and regions including Ketta, Haran, Gwadar, Panjgur, Tump, Pasni, Mastung, Nushki, and Dalbandin. The attacks began at 04:00 local time on Saturday with suicide bombings in Nushki and Pasni, followed by armed and grenade assaults at over 12 locations. Insurgents seized at least six district administration buildings and advanced within 1 kilometer of the provincial chief minister's office in Ketta. Pakistani security forces launched a counteroperation in Nushki after three days of intense fighting, deploying additional soldiers, helicopters, and drones. In the clashes, 197 militants were killed. The incident marks one of the deadliest attacks in the region in recent years, with the death toll rising to 58 as of February 4, 2026, according to Haberler.com.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:46 AM\nSource:[Haberler.com](https://en.haberler.com/three-days-of-bloody-conflict-in-the-desert-the-19536337/?utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=tavsiye_et)\n\n**Balochistan in flames: Why India must watch Pakistan closely and up its guard**\nThe Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) carried out a series of coordinated attacks on January 31, 2026, across multiple locations in Pakistan's Balochistan province, including Gwadar, Pasni, Panjgur, Tump, Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, and Kharan, resulting in 17 security personnel, 31 civilians, and 133 BLA insurgents killed. Pakistani authorities claimed to have killed 40 additional insurgents in follow-up operations. The attacks were the deadliest by the BLA since the March 2025 Jaffer Express attack. Pakistan's military, under Field Marshal Asim Munir, has labeled the BLA as 'Fitna al Hindustan'\u2014a term implying Indian instigation\u2014and accused India of financial, strategic, and operational support, citing a January 31 press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations stating that 'terrorists of Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan' were behind the attacks. Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti publicly blamed India, with Bugti asserting, 'India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.' On February 3, 2026, Pakistan\u2019s National Assembly passed a resolution condemning the attacks and pointing to foreign involvement, particularly India, though it did not explicitly accuse India after the Jaffer Express attack. Despite the rhetoric, the Pakistani military has not indicated immediate action. Analysts note that the army may be restrained due to the lack of targeted attacks on Punjabi soldiers\u2014central to the army\u2019s identity\u2014unlike in the Jaffer Express incident. Additionally, India has not yet publicly blamed Pakistan for the November 2025 Delhi attack, in which 15 people died. The current geopolitical context, including India-US trade cooperation and the exclusion of Pakistan from the Pax Silica forum, may influence Pakistan\u2019s strategic calculus. While a tit-for-tat terrorist response remains a possibility, the potential for international backlash\u2014especially through FATF mechanisms\u2014may deter such action. Nevertheless, Indian security officials are advised to remain vigilant, as pressure on the Pakistani military to respond could grow over time.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 08:13 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/balochistan-in-flames-why-india-must-watch-pakistan-closely-and-up-its-guard-13975838.html)\n\n**Military News Roundup: Key Developments from February 3, 2026**\nOn February 3, 2026, multiple global military developments unfolded. The U.S. military shot down an Iranian 'Shahed-139' drone approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea, highlighting ongoing tensions in the region. In a prelude to peace talks in Abu Dhabi, Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine, firing approximately 450 drones and 70 missiles overnight on February 3, targeting power grids and civilian infrastructure in cities including Kyiv, resulting in at least 10 injuries, widespread power outages, and damage to a historic museum; Ukrainian President Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as wartime intimidation and urgently appealed for allied air defense support, casting a shadow over upcoming negotiations. Meanwhile, the JF-17 'Thunder' fighter jet from Pakistan has seen surging international interest from Iraq, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Libya, but Pakistan's annual production capacity remains below 20 aircraft, limiting its ability to meet export demand\u2014especially if large orders like Saudi Arabia's materialize, threatening its goal to become a major weapons exporter to developing nations. In Sudan, the Sudanese Armed Forces announced they had lifted a two-year siege on the town of Kadugli in South Kordofan, with special forces entering the city and reopening a key highway; the siege, which began in July 2023 and was confirmed by the UN to have caused famine in November 2025, marks a significant development in the ongoing civil war that began in April 2023. China's Air Force 'Eight One' Aerobatic Team delivered a stunning aerial display at the Singapore Airshow on February 3, showcasing advanced flying skills and national military prowess. In Pakistan, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) carried out coordinated attacks across Balochistan, killing over 30 people including 15 soldiers and 18 civilians, using drones and targeting both military and civilian sites, exposing weaknesses in Pakistan\u2019s intelligence, equipment, and civilian security, and intensifying concerns over the safety of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), prompting China to reaffirm its support and enhance joint security measures. Amid India-Pakistan tensions, the success of Chinese-made J-10 and JF-17 fighters in combat has attracted foreign interest, challenging Western platforms like France\u2019s Rafale, though Pakistan\u2019s limited production capacity and reliance on Chinese and Russian components restrict immediate export expansion. In a geopolitical move, a Russian Il-76 transport aircraft landed at a military base near Havana, Cuba, on the evening of February 1, following a multi-stop flight from Russia; the aircraft\u2019s operator is under U.S. sanctions and the mission\u2019s purpose and cargo remain unclear, occurring amid rising U.S.-Cuba and U.S.-Venezuela tensions, including U.S. military strikes and oil sanctions. Lastly, NASA suspended the 'Artemis II' crewed lunar mission simulation due to a liquid hydrogen leak at the rocket core stage, along with issues in crew module valves and communications; as a result, the launch window has been postponed from February to March 2026 to allow for comprehensive data review and technical resolution.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:06 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u5fc3](https://news.sina.com.cn/zx/ds/2026-02-04/doc-inhkqwsv6815884.shtml)\n\n**197 militants killed in three-day security operation across Balochistan**\nIn a three-day counterterrorism operation across Balochistan, Pakistani security forces killed 197 militants linked to India-sponsored Fitna al-Hindustan following coordinated attacks on 12 towns on February 31, 2026. The attacks, carried out by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), resulted in the martyrdom of 17 security officials and 31 civilians, including women and children, in Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar, and Pasni. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 22 soldiers were martyred while protecting civilians and state assets during the operation. Additionally, 36 civilians were killed in the attacks, including 18 innocent individuals\u2014women, children, the elderly, and labourers\u2014targeted in Gwadar and Kharan, as part of a broader effort to disrupt daily life and development in the province. Security forces responded with immediate clearance operations, killing 92 India-backed terrorists, including three suicide bombers. The ISPR confirmed that intelligence reports unequivocally established that the attacks were orchestrated by terrorist ring leaders operating from outside Pakistan and maintained direct communication with operatives during the incident. The operation also included sanitisation efforts to apprehend instigators, perpetrators, facilitators, and abettors. The ISPR praised the security forces for their 'unwavering courage and professional excellence' and stated that troops engaged terrorists with precision, successfully thwarting the terrorists' 'evil design'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:58 PM\nSource:[GEO TV](https://www.geo.tv/latest/648881-197-militants-killed-in-three-day-security-operation-across-balochistan)\n\n**Pakistan: Security in Balochistan at New Low Amid Escalating Violence and Separatist Unrest**\nBelutschistan, a resource-rich but impoverished province in western Pakistan with about 15 million inhabitants, has experienced a severe escalation in violence, marked by coordinated armed attacks and suicide bombings over the weekend that resulted in at least 50 deaths, mostly civilians including women and children. The attacks, described as 'extremely severe and significant' by Michael Kugelman of the Atlantic Council and 'widespread and coordinated' by researcher Sahar Baloch, represent the bloodiest period in the region in years. The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) reports a 60% increase in conflict incidents and fatalities in 2025 alone, making it the deadliest year on record. The Pakistani military has conducted raids targeting members of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), claiming to have killed 177 militants, though the BLA, which demands greater autonomy or independence and accuses the central government in Islamabad of exploitation and discrimination, is designated a terrorist organization by Pakistan, the UK, and the US. Pakistan has alleged Indian support for the BLA without providing evidence, a claim denied by New Delhi, raising fears of regional escalation. The province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, has long suffered from unrest due to systemic grievances, including marginalization and lack of development. The BLA and other separatist groups have targeted Pakistani security forces and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major component of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. Experts like Kugelman and Baloch emphasize that the military response has failed, pointing to the BLA\u2019s growing operational capacity and the failure of intelligence services. They argue that lasting stability requires addressing root causes through dialogue with local communities rather than continued militarization. The region remains deeply militarized, with the Baloch people organized in tribes and lacking strong allegiance to the state.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 06:54 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/de/pakistan-sicherheit-in-belutschistan-erreicht-neuen-tiefpunkt/a-75789859)\n\n**Pakistan: Security in Balochistan hits new low**\nA series of coordinated gun attacks and suicide bombings targeting schools, banks, and security installations across Pakistan's Balochistan province on the weekend resulted in 50 deaths, mostly civilians including women and children. The attacks, described as the most violent in the region in years by Michael Kugelman, a senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council, and Sahar Baloch, a Berlin-based researcher, indicate a significant escalation in the operational tempo of the Baloch separatist insurgency. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the strongest armed faction in the region, has been linked to the attacks, with Pakistani authorities claiming India supports the group\u2014denied by New Delhi. Pakistan has launched raids, reporting 177 BLA fighters killed, and imposed restrictions on public gatherings and face coverings. Despite heavy military presence, the violence has intensified, with data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project showing a 60% rise in incidents and fatalities in 2025, the deadliest year on record. Kugelman criticized Pakistan\u2019s reliance on military force, calling it ineffective and pointing to intelligence failures, while Baloch emphasized the BLA\u2019s capacity to sustain cycles of violence. Experts, including Kugelman, advocate for political dialogue to address deep-seated grievances rather than continued military suppression.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:57 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/pakistan-security-in-balochistan-hits-new-low/a-75787738)\n\n**Pakistan Army Kills 177 Militants in Major Offensive After Large-Scale Attack by Baloch Separatist Group**\nFollowing a large-scale attack by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist militant group in southwestern Pakistan's Balochistan province, Pakistani security forces reported the killing of 177 militants as of February 3, 2026. The attack, which began on January 31, 2026, targeted military installations, police stations, and civilian facilities using simultaneous suicide bombings and gunfire. According to Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, 22 additional BLA members were killed on February 2, bringing the total to 177. The violence has resulted in 33 civilian and 17 security force deaths, raising the total fatalities to 227. Experts describe the number of militants killed in just three days as the highest in decades. The Pakistani government claims the attack was supported by India, with Naqvi stating that 'Indian operatives and their collaborators will be completely eliminated.' In response, Pakistan announced it would not play against India in the upcoming T20 Cricket World Cup. The BLA described the operation as part of a 'Black Storm Campaign' targeting Pakistani security forces across Balochistan. According to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), attacks by separatist groups in Balochistan have surged over the past five years, with a 60% increase in incidents and fatalities compared to the previous year. Analyst Abdul Baset from Nanyang Technological University noted that neither the insurgents nor the state can fully defeat the other, creating a deadlock that fuels extreme violence in the region. Balochistan, rich in mineral resources but among Pakistan's poorest provinces, has seen ongoing insurgency driven by grievances over resource exploitation by the government and foreign capital. The Pakistani military has responded with large-scale counterinsurgency operations, leading to continued casualties on both sides.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:19 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20260203087100104)\n\n**Pakistan Forces Conduct Multiple Raids, Kill 177 Baloch Militants in Two Days**\nPakistan security forces conducted multiple nighttime raids in the southwestern region near the Afghanistan border, killing approximately 177 Baloch separatist fighters over a two-day period, marking the highest number of fatalities in decades. The operations began on January 31, 2026, following a series of coordinated attacks by nearly 200 armed militants targeting police stations, homes, and security facilities in Balochistan. These attacks, attributed to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), resulted in at least 33 deaths, including 18 civilians and 15 security personnel. Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi claimed the slain fighters were 'Indian-funded terrorists' without providing evidence, a claim that India has not yet responded to. The violence prompted widespread condemnation from political leaders, including Imran Khan\u2019s party, which has called for an end to the violence. The raids were carried out with military support and are described as a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict in the region.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:21 PM\nSource:[Liberty Times Net](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/5330500)\n\n**22 Separatist Militants Killed in New Pakistani Military Operations in Baluchistan**\nPakistani security forces reported the deaths of 22 Baloch separatist militants in new operations conducted in Baluchistan province, located in the southwest of the country, bringing the total death toll from fighting since the weekend to over 200. The Pakistani Army, which refers to these militants as 'Fitna al Hindustan' (meaning 'chaos of India'), stated that 177 militants have died in the past 48 hours. Preliminary reports also indicate 36 civilian and military fatalities, marking the bloodiest clashes in months. Operations were launched after alleged members of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) carried out coordinated attacks on Saturday across more than ten localities in Baluchistan, targeting government and security installations. The mobile phone service remains suspended in Quetta and other cities such as Mastung, Kalat, Nushki, and Dalband\u00edn for a third consecutive day, according to the Pakistani newspaper 'Dawn'. This is not the first time the government has cut internet access in Baluchistan for security reasons; in November, mobile services were suspended across 36 districts of the province for a week.

The most significant military operation was Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7, 2025, in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 25 tourists and one local guide\u2014the deadliest attack on civilians in Jammu and Kashmir since the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Operation Sindoor involved missile strikes on nine terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), resulting in the deaths of over 100 terrorists, including high-value commanders, with seven camps destroyed by the Indian Army and two by the Indian Air Force. The operation was coordinated from the Directorate General of Military Operations\u2019 Ops Room, with oversight from the Chief of Defence Staff and the chiefs of all three services. Pakistan retaliated with heavy shelling along the Line of Control (LoC) from May 7 to May 10, killing at least 21 Indian civilians, and attempted drone attacks on four consecutive nights, all of which were intercepted by Indian Army air defence units. Indian forces also destroyed over a dozen terror launch pads, disrupting infiltration routes. On May 10, a ceasefire was agreed upon after a meeting between the Indian and Pakistani DGMOs. The Border Security Force reported eight militants killed in four foiled infiltration attempts, with only four attempts recorded in total\u2014two before and two after Operation Sindoor. The government enhanced counter-terrorism efforts through improved intelligence, inter-agency coordination, AI-enabled analysis, upgraded Multi-Agency Centres, advanced surveillance, and forensic modernization, leading to reduced terror threats. Security force casualties included one soldier killed in April in Udhampur, two Army personnel in an IED blast in Akhnoor in February, and additional deaths from cross-border firing and operations in Baramulla, Kulgam, Kishtwar, Rajouri, and Kupwara. On November 14, a powerful explosion at Nowgam Police Station in Srinagar killed nine and injured at least 32; the Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police described it as accidental. The government announced ex-gratia payments of Rs 10 lakh to families of the deceased and Rs 1 lakh to the injured, with the Lieutenant Governor issuing government appointment letters to the victims' families in December. Union Home Minister Amit Shah praised the Jammu and Kashmir Police for their investigation into the November 10, 2025, Red Fort blast in Delhi, calling it a 'masterclass' and an 'outstanding instance of watertight investigation,' and cited both the Pahalgam and Delhi attacks as models for intelligence agencies globally. Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha commended the police for dismantling a pan-India 'white-collar' terror module, stating that their work prevented multiple terror incidents across the country.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 04:55 PM\nSource:[Kashmir Life](https://kashmirlife.net/in-2025-46-militants-killed-in-35-incidents-across-jammu-kashmir-419084/)\n\n**'80 drones, 36 hrs': In anti-India rhetoric, Pak FM ends up admitting Operation Sindoor strike**\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed during a year-end press briefing that India conducted a drone attack on the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi's Chaklala, damaging the facility and injuring military personnel. Dar stated that India launched at least 80 drones over a 36-hour period, with 79 intercepted and one penetrating to cause damage. This admission followed India's Operation Sindoor, a retaliatory military strike launched on May 7, 2025, in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Operation Sindoor targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir (PoK), and also struck 11 Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan, Sargodha, Rafiqui, Jacobabad, and Muridke. Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed the attack, stating that Army Chief General Asim Munir informed him at 2:30 a.m. on May 10. Pakistan\u2019s advisor Rana Sanaullah later admitted Islamabad had only 30 to 45 seconds to assess whether a BrahMos missile fired by India carried a nuclear warhead. Indian Army veteran Lt Gen (Retd) KJS Dhillon challenged Dar\u2019s claim of 'minor damage and injuries,' citing Samaa TV\u2019s August 14, 2025, report naming 138 posthumously awarded gallantry awardees from Operation Sindoor\u2014indicating at least 400\u2013500 fatalities. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies, captured on May 13, 2025, confirmed significant damage to four Pakistani air bases: Nur Khan, PAF Base Mushaf, Bholari, and PAF Base Shahbaz. Earlier, on May 10, Pakistan\u2019s military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry claimed three air bases\u2014Nur Khan, Muridke, and Rafiqui\u2014were targeted by Indian missiles and drones.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 28, 2025 07:25 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/80-drones-36-hrs-in-anti-india-rhetoric-pak-fm-ishaq-dar-ends-up-admitting-operation-sindoor-strike-101766903552586.html)\n\n**Year Ender 2025: India\u2019s Precision Strikes Against Pakistan-Backed Terrorists**\nIndia's 2025 Year-End Report highlights a decisive year in its counter-terrorism efforts, marking a shift toward 'offensive defense' against terrorism. Following the Pahalgam attack on April 22, which killed 26 people, India conducted multiple precision strikes across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), targeting high-value terrorist commanders and infrastructure. Operation SINDOOR (May 7\u201310, 2025) reportedly destroyed nine major terrorist camps and killed 70\u2013100+ militants, including top commanders from Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), such as Mudassar Khadim Khan (Abu Jundal), Ha\ufb01z Muhammad Jamil, Mohammad Yusuf Azhar (linked to the IC 814 hijacking), Khalid (Abu Akasha), and Mohammad Hasan Khan. Operation MAHADEV (July 28\u201329, 2025) eliminated three key Pakistani operatives\u2014Suleman Shah (Hashim Musa), Abu Hamza, and Yasir\u2014believed to be masterminds or executors of the Pahalgam attack, as confirmed by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Parliament. Additional operations in March and May 2025 resulted in the elimination of several other high-profile terrorists, including Safullah (LeT), Asif Ahmed Sheikh, Amir Nazir Wani, Yawar Ahmad Bhat, Ehsan Ahmed Sheikh, Shahid Ahmad Kute, and Adnan Shafi Dar, all linked to Pakistan-based networks. By November 29, 2025, India claimed to have neutralized over 110 Pakistan-linked or Pakistani terrorists across multiple operations. The article asserts that India\u2019s strategy has shifted from border retaliation to direct action inside Pakistan and PoK, severely damaging Pakistan\u2019s terror ecosystem. The central message is clear: 'The response to terrorism will now be delivered at the enemy\u2019s doorstep.'\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: November 29, 2025 04:22 AM\nSource:[OneIndia](https://hindi.oneindia.com/news/india/year-ender-2025-terriost-list-who-killed-india-major-operations-distroyed-pakistan-terror-networks-1440787.html)\n\n**Afghanistan-Pakistan Military Tensions Threaten Regional Stability**\nOn November 24, 2025, Pakistani military aircraft conducted airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan, targeting Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant hideouts in Khost, Kunar, and Paktika provinces, according to Pakistani intelligence. The strikes resulted in at least ten civilian deaths, including nine children, and injured four others, as reported by Taliban officials. The Afghan Taliban denied harboring TTP militants and condemned the attacks, citing violations of sovereignty and civilian casualties. These actions followed a series of violent attacks in Pakistan, including a suicide bombing in Islamabad that killed 12 people and another in Peshawar that killed three security personnel. The strikes have undermined the October 2025 Doha-mediated ceasefire agreement between Kabul and Islamabad, escalating regional tensions. Pakistan alleges India supports anti-Pakistan groups in Afghanistan, a claim India has denied. The ongoing conflict reflects deep challenges in cross-border intelligence sharing, border control, and trust-building. The Taliban\u2019s public stance emphasizes civilian protection and denies complicity, possibly to deter further Pakistani incursions and maintain domestic legitimacy. Since the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Kabul in August 2021, the presence of terrorist groups and foreign fighters has increased regional concern. The cycle of violence risks destabilizing the border region, fueling retaliatory attacks by TTP, eroding trust, and potentially drawing in regional powers. Civilian casualties continue to heighten humanitarian and political risks, with implications for future counterterrorism cooperation and regional stability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[SpecialEurasia](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2025/11/25/afghanistan-pakistan-military-tensions-threaten-regional-stability/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=afghanistan-pakistan-military-tensions-threaten-regional-stability)\n\n**'We Will Respond at the Right Time': Taliban Warns Pakistan After Aerial Strikes Kill 10, Including Nine Children**\nOn November 25, 2025, at around midnight (Indian time), Pakistan conducted aerial strikes on several residential areas in Afghanistan\u2019s Paktika, Kunar, and Khost provinces. The attacks resulted in the deaths of 10 people, including nine children\u2014five boys and four girls\u2014and one woman. In the Khost province\u2019s Gurbaz district, a residential house was targeted, while in Paktika\u2019s Baral district, a mosque was struck, leaving two people seriously injured. Afghan Taliban spokesperson Jabirullah Mujahid condemned the strikes on social media platform X, calling them violations of Afghan sovereignty and international norms. He stated that Pakistan\u2019s actions were based on incorrect intelligence, worsened regional tensions, and exposed the failure of Pakistan\u2019s military leadership. The Taliban reiterated its right to defend its territorial integrity and people, warning that a 'necessary and decisive response' would be delivered at the 'right time.' As of the publication date, neither Pakistan\u2019s military nor Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s government had issued an official statement or comment regarding the allegations.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 11:59 AM\nSource:[hindi](https://www.abplive.com/news/world/afghanistan-fierced-upon-pakistan-and-pak-army-over-attack-and-death-of-10-people-including-9-children-ann-3048936)\n\n**India Delhi deadly car bomb accused appears in court**\nOn November 17, 2025, Indian anti-terrorism investigators presented Amir Rashid Ali, a suspect linked to a deadly car bomb attack in New Delhi, in court. The blast, which occurred on November 10 near a busy metro station close to the Red Fort, killed at least 10 people according to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), though hospital officials reported 12 fatalities\u2014making it unclear if the suicide bomber, Umar Un Nabi, is included in the death toll. Ali is accused of conspiring with Nabi, a former medical professor in Haryana, to carry out the attack using a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED). The NIA stated that Ali had traveled to Delhi to facilitate the purchase of the car used in the bombing. Both suspects are believed to have come from Indian-administered Kashmir, a region contested by India and Pakistan since 1947. Prime Minister Narendra Modi labeled the attack a 'conspiracy' and vowed to bring perpetrators, collaborators, and sponsors to justice. The attack was the deadliest since April 22, 2025, when 26 civilians were killed in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir\u2014an attack New Delhi blamed on Pakistan, which denied involvement. In May 2025, India launched cross-border strikes, triggering four days of conflict that killed at least 70 people. After a ceasefire, Modi declared that any attack on Indian soil would be treated as an act of war. On the same day as the court appearance, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi warned Pakistan, comparing the May conflict to a 'trailer' and stating that 'the movie hasn't even started'\u2014indicating India's readiness for a larger confrontation if provoked.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 12:48 PM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/11/17/india-delhi-deadly-car-bomb-accused-appears-in-court)\n\n**The Delhi Blast and Kashmir's Simmering Discontent: Why India's Pakistan Strategy Has Failed**\nThe November 10, 2024 blast near the Red Fort metro station in Delhi, which killed 13 people and injured over 30, appears to have been carried out by a group of Kashmiri doctors, with Dr. Umar Nabi from Pulwama at the center. He was driving the hatchback used in the explosion, which likely detonated prematurely, as no pellet injuries were reported and the vehicle was not rammed into a major target. The attack follows raids by Jammu and Kashmir police on doctors linked to Al Falah Medical College in Faridabad, including Dr. Muzammil Ahmad Ganai, also from Pulwama. The incident reflects long-standing discontent in Kashmir following the revocation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, which removed the region\u2019s constitutional special status. Despite claims by Home Minister Amit Shah that tourism recovery indicates normalcy, terrorist ambushes in Jammu continued through 2023\u20132024, culminating in the Pahalgam tourist killings on April 22, 2024, and a subsequent military standoff with Pakistan from May 7\u201310. Although India claimed tactical success, Pakistan gained global sympathy in the narrative war. On November 11, 2024, a suicide bombing in Islamabad killed 12 people, with the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) initially claiming and then denying responsibility\u2014though Indian social media speculated it was a retaliatory strike by India. The article argues that India\u2019s strategy of ignoring Pakistan has failed, and that no military escalation will eliminate terrorism without dialogue. The author emphasizes that diplomacy, once viable during talks between General Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (2006\u20132007), is now politically marginalized in India, with youth increasingly dismissing peace efforts as 'leftist' or ineffective. The article concludes that lasting peace and India\u2019s global strategic ambitions require engagement with Pakistan, not isolation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 09:16 AM\nSource:[Frontline](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/red-fort-blast-kashmir-terrorism-india-pakistan-relations/article70274404.ece)\n\n**Pakistan bleeds within, while ministers, generals hide behind false bravado**\nOn October 8, 2024, a deadly gunfight in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) region near the Afghan border resulted in the deaths of 11 military personnel, including Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Arif and Major Tayyab Rahat, during an intelligence operation targeting 'Khawarij' groups, notably the Pakistan Taliban (TTP), which claimed responsibility. The army reported 19 fighters were also killed. The attack involved a roadside bomb ambush and intense fire. Despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's tribute to the fallen, the incident undermines the Pakistani Army's public claims of national security, highlighting ongoing morale issues and operational inconsistencies. Meanwhile, Afghanistan's Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited India on October 9, the first high-level Taliban visit since 2021, facilitated by a UN travel waiver, with discussions expected on trade and security, though India has not yet formally recognized the Taliban government. This visit follows a joint regional statement from Afghanistan's neighbors, including India, Pakistan, Iran, China, and Central Asian states, opposing foreign military infrastructure in the region\u2014seen as a rebuke to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to reclaim the Bagram base. In a separate development, Pakistan\u2019s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif made baseless historical claims, asserting India was only united under Mughal rule, and warned of real war chances with India\u2014remarks dismissed as jingoistic and historically inaccurate. Asif previously promoted absurd flood mitigation solutions, including storing floodwater in containers, and falsely claimed Indian jets were shot down during India\u2019s Operation Sindoor, citing social media without evidence. On October 9, Pakistani fighter jets conducted airstrikes on Kabul, targeting TTP positions, possibly aimed at leader Noor Wali Mehsud, though a viral audio recording denied his death. Islamabad has not officially confirmed the strikes, and the Defense Ministry and Air Force remain silent. The article criticizes Pakistan\u2019s military leadership, particularly Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, for reckless rhetoric and military adventurism, arguing that Pakistan\u2019s internal security apparatus is dysfunctional and that its aggressive actions, including attacks on civilian areas in Kabul, reflect desperation and a failure to address domestic instability. The author, a retired IPS officer and former National Security Advisor of Mauritius, concludes that Pakistan must stabilize internally before pursuing regional military posturing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 06:29 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pakistan-afghanistan-india-diplomacy-13941382.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
