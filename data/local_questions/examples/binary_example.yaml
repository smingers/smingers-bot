title: "Will the next iPhone have a folding screen?"
question_type: binary

description: |
  Apple has been rumored to be working on foldable phone technology for several years.
  This question asks whether the next iPhone model released after this question was
  created will feature a folding/foldable screen design.

resolution_criteria: |
  Resolves YES if Apple releases an iPhone with a screen that physically folds
  (similar to Samsung Galaxy Fold or Motorola Razr) as part of the main iPhone lineup.

  Resolves NO if the next iPhone release uses a traditional non-folding screen design.

fine_print: |
  - "Next iPhone" refers to the next major iPhone model announced after question creation
  - iPad or other Apple devices don't count - must be branded as "iPhone"
  - A concept/prototype doesn't count - must be a publicly purchasable product
  - Minor screen flexibility (like slight curves) doesn't qualify as "folding"
