resolution_criteria: |
  The geographic origin of and weaponry used in a military strike will be
  immaterial so long as either the weapon detonates or discharges on or over
  Iranian territory. A cyberattack alone will not count.

  For the purposes of this question, US national military forces exclude US
  intelligence services (e.g., CIA).

  Public acknowledgment is not required, and the default evidentiary standard
  would be used, that being credible, open-source media reporting.

  - Geographic origin of strike is immaterial
  - Weaponry type is immaterial
  - Cyberattacks do not count
  - CIA and other intelligence services do not count as "national military forces"
  - Resolution based on credible open-source media reporting
