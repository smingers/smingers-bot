6. Technicalities: Probabilities will sum to 100, no % sign

Probability Calibration:
Considering the evidence, military positioning, and geopolitical tensions, I've adjusted the probabilities to reflect a higher likelihood of action in the May-September 2026 window.

Probabilities: [18, 45, 27, 10]

Rationale for Probabilities:
- Slightly reduced probability for earliest window due to ongoing negotiations
- Increased probability for May-September window reflecting military readiness
- Moderate probability for September-January window
- Low probability for post-January 2027 to account for potential long-term tensions
