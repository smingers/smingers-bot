Moderate Evidence:
- Iranian domestic protests
- Economic sanctions impact
- Regional diplomatic maneuvering

Weak Evidence:

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction Window: 3-12 months
If halved (1.5-6 months): Higher probability of diplomatic resolution
If doubled (6-24 months): Increased chance of prolonged tension, potential regime changes

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rates:
- Escalating military preparations
- Diplomatic breakdown
- Domestic Iranian instability
- Trump administration's interventionist approach

Checklist Verification:
1. Options: US military strike in Iranian territory/airspace/waters before specific dates
2. Base Rate: Distributed across timeframes based on historical interventions
3. Consistency: Most likely: May-September 2026; Least likely: After January 2027
4. Significant Evidence:
   - US military asset concentration
   - Ongoing nuclear tensions
   - Iranian domestic unrest
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough or internal regime change

Probability Calibration:
Considering the complex geopolitical landscape, military positioning, and historical precedents, I've adjusted probabilities to reflect nuanced likelihood.

Probabilities: [12, 43, 31, 14]

Rationale for Probabilities:
- Option A (Before May 2026): Low probability due to ongoing diplomatic efforts
- Option B (May-September 2026): Highest probability, peak tension period
- Option C (September 2026-January 2027): Moderate probability, potential escalation window
- Option D (After January 2027): Low probability, suggests prolonged diplomatic engagement

The probabilities reflect a careful assessment of current geopolitical dynamics, military preparations, and historical intervention patterns.
