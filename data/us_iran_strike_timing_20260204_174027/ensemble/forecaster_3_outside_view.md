Most Suitable: US Responses to Nuclear Proliferation
- Historical precedent of limited, targeted strikes
- Diplomatic negotiations preceding potential military action

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current date: 2026-02-04
- Prediction Window: Approximately 3-24 months

(d) Justification:
Key Factors:

- Domestic Iranian unrest
- Trump administration's hawkish stance
- Regional geopolitical constraints
- Economic and strategic risks of full-scale intervention

Outside view calibration:
- Considering historical US intervention patterns
- Expert assessments (e.g., McNally's 75% probability)
- Diplomatic and military positioning
- Risk of unintended escalation

Probability Adjustment Considerations:
- Precise strikes more likely than comprehensive invasion
- Diplomatic channels not completely exhausted
- Economic and political risks of intervention
- Domestic US political divisions on military action

Outside View Prediction:
Option_A (Before 11 May 2026): 12%
Option_B (Between 11 May 2026 and 9 September 2026): 43%
Option_C (Between 10 September 2026 and 9 January 2027): 31%
Option_D (Not before 9 January 2027): 14%

Rationale: Most likely timeframe is the mid-2026 window, balancing diplomatic pressure, military positioning, and strategic considerations. The prediction reflects the complex geopolitical landscape and the likelihood of measured, strategic action rather than immediate or prolonged intervention.
