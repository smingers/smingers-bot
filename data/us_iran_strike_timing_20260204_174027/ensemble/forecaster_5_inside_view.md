(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction Timeframe: 3-9 months from current date (February 2026)

Scenario Considerations:

- Reduced diplomatic buffer compared to historical precedents

Probability Calibration:

Checklist Verification:
1. Options: US military strike within Iran's territory/airspace/waters before specific dates
2. Base Rate Distribution: Aligned with escalating tensions
3. Consistency: Between May-September 2026 most likely; January 2027 least likely
4. Key Evidence:

5. Blind Spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough

Technicality Check:
- Probabilities between 0-100
