First, a Iranian military drone, identified as a Shahed-139, was shot down by a U.S. F-35C fighter jet from the USS Abraham Lincoln after approaching the aircraft carrier. The U.S. Central Command stated the action was taken in 'legitimate defense' to protect the ship and crew. Hours later, Iranian speedboats attempted to intercept and seize the U.S.-flagged oil tanker Stena Imperative in international waters near the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. destroyer USS McFaul intervened, escorting the vessel to safety. Iranian sources claimed the tanker entered Iranian territorial waters without permission and was warned, but maritime monitoring agencies confirmed it was in international waters. The ISW stated both incidents were likely aimed at testing U.S. military response and may signal the beginning of an Iranian maritime escalation to deter potential U.S. attacks. The U.S. has deployed at least 10 warships to the region, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and six destroyers: USS Spruance, USS Michael Murphy, USS Frank E. Petersen Jr., USS Delbert D. Black, USS Mitscher, and USS McFaul. The move follows President Donald Trump's renewed pressure on Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to return to nuclear negotiations, which are scheduled for Friday, February 6, in Oman. Iran maintains its uranium enrichment program is peaceful, but the U.S. and Israel remain skeptical. The U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal under Trump in 2018, citing Iran\u2019s support for terrorist groups. Iran operates 10 naval bases in the Strait of Hormuz\u2014eight under the Revolutionary Guard and two under the regular navy\u2014according to the ISW.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 10:43 AM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2026/02/04/ira-testou-reacao-exercito-eua-drone-porta-avioes-tentativa-ataque-petroleiro-diz-instituto.ghtml)\n\n**U.S. Shoots Down Iranian Drone Near Arabian Sea, Escalates Tensions Amid Nuclear Talks**\nOn February 3, 2026, the U.S. Central Command (CentCom) confirmed that an F-35C fighter jet from the USS Abraham Lincoln destroyed an Iranian drone, the Shahed-139, in the Arabian Sea, approximately 800 kilometers off southern Iran. The drone approached the U.S. aircraft carrier with an 'aggressive' posture and 'unclear intentions,' despite U.S. forces operating in international waters with de-escalatory measures. The drone was neutralized in self-defense to protect the carrier and its crew, with no injuries or material damage reported. CentCom stated, 'No tolerance will be given to Iran\u2019s continuous harassment and threats in international waters and airspace,' emphasizing that unnecessary Iranian aggression near U.S. forces, regional allies, and commercial vessels increases the risk of collision, miscalculation, and regional destabilization. Hours later, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps harassed the U.S.-flagged merchant vessel Stena Imperative in the Strait of Hormuz, with two boats and a Mohajer drone approaching at high speed and threatening to board the tanker. This incident occurred in one of the world\u2019s most critical oil transit routes, triggering market concern and driving oil prices to intraday highs. The UK\u2019s Maritime Trade Operations Centre also reported that another vessel in the strait was contacted by 'numerous armed small boats' via radio, with no vessel identification provided. U.S. Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, CentCom spokesperson, reiterated the drone shootdown was a defensive action and confirmed no U.S. personnel were harmed. These events unfold amid escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran, as diplomats attempt to revive nuclear negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump warned that 'bad things will likely happen' if no agreement is reached, while Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani confirmed ongoing diplomatic efforts. The incidents follow Iran\u2019s violent suppression of anti-government protests\u2014the most severe since 1979\u2014and the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to intervene, coupled with increased military presence in the region, including the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group. The global oil market reacted sharply, with prices rising due to the strategic importance of the Arabian Sea and the Strait of Hormuz, which handle roughly one-third of global crude oil shipments.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:24 PM\nSource:[Diario Panorama](https://www.diariopanorama.com/noticia/542308/estados-unidos-derribo-dron-irani-se-acerco-portaaviones-mar-arabigo)\n\n**U.S. Shoots Down Iranian Drone Near Aircraft Carrier Amid Escalating Tensions**\nOn February 3, 2026, a U.S. F-35 fighter jet shot down an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea after it approached a U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in an 'aggressive manner,' according to a senior military official. Captain Tim Hawkins, spokesperson for U.S. Central Command, stated the action was taken in self-defense to protect the carrier and its crew, with no injuries or damage reported. Despite the incident, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt confirmed that planned talks between U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian officials remained scheduled, noting that President Donald Trump has multiple options on the table\u2014including military force. However, concerns were raised by Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which previously declared they would not allow U.S. use of their airspace or territory for strikes against Iran to avoid potential retaliatory attacks. Although the Trump administration has increased military presence in the region, U.S. officials told the Wall Street Journal that air strikes against Iran are not imminent. Instead, the Pentagon is prioritizing the deployment of additional air defense systems to protect Israel, its Arab allies, and U.S. forces in anticipation of possible Iranian retaliation and a prolonged conflict.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 07:07 PM\nSource:[LExpress.fr](https://www.lexpress.fr/monde/proche-moyen-orient/washington-annonce-avoir-abattu-un-drone-iranien-ayant-approche-un-porte-avions-de-maniere-agressive-6T6TATCAMFCKPEQDXB3YL2QG74/)\n\n**US and Iran on brink of war: White House considers all scenarios ahead of critical February 6 talks**\nThe United States and Iran stand on the brink of war as critical negotiations are set for February 6, 2026, in Istanbul, aimed at resolving Iran's nuclear programme. Although President Donald Trump publicly supports diplomacy, White House officials are actively evaluating both military and diplomatic options. The US has deployed a carrier strike group and significant munitions to the Gulf, creating a credible military threat, while Iran faces internal unrest from mass protests and international isolation. Despite Trump sending envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to negotiate with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, concerns persist that the talks are a cover for potential military action. A prior attempt at diplomacy failed in 2025 after Trump authorized strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, and a second effort last autumn collapsed due to mistrust from clandestine US actions. Israeli military leaders, including Chief of the General Staff Eyal Zamir, recently visited Washington to discuss offensive and defensive plans, with US officials noting that while Trump remains hesitant, Israeli officials are pushing for war. Three of Trump\u2019s advisors believe a military strike is currently inappropriate, citing risks to his regional and global agenda. Iran has stated it will only discuss nuclear issues, not missile development, and the two sides remain far apart. A senior mediator warned that failure to bring 'tangible evidence' to the talks could lead Iran into a 'very bad situation.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:27 PM\nSource:[bankingnews.gr](https://www.bankingnews.gr/index.php?id=854122)\n\n**Tehran Warns of Unveiling Maps: Half of Enemies' Capabilities Within Reach of First Strike**\nA report presented by a senior commander of Iran's Aerospace Force to the Islamic Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee revealed Iran's military readiness to respond immediately to any potential attack. According to Representative Ebrahim Radaei, the report emphasized Iran's intelligence superiority, enabling precise tracking of adversaries' movements, and confirmed that all operational procedures are prepared for any military confrontation scenario with the United States. The report stated that U.S. military and economic interests in the region fall within the operational range of Iranian forces, warning that any U.S. attack could trigger a broad regional conflict\u2014described as 'one of Iran's greatest gains' if it occurs. The report also highlighted the results of Operation 'Sincere Promise 3,' a 12-day exercise in which Iran claimed to have penetrated the joint missile defense systems of its adversaries with over 50% success. Radaei added that, according to Iranian assessments, any future war would begin with direct strikes on enemy interests, potentially destroying about half of their capabilities in the first phase. These remarks were made during a committee session discussing regional developments, military deployments around Iran, and conditions tied to potential escalation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:51 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646](https://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/8218334)\n\n**WSJ: Trump Administration Discusses Goals for Potential Strikes on Iran**\nThe Trump administration is considering various scenarios for potential strikes against Iran, as reported by The Wall Street Journal on January 30, 2026. The U.S. military has established a substantial force in the Middle East within range of Iran, and President Donald Trump must now decide how to use it. Possible targets include weakening Iran's nuclear capabilities, destroying its ballistic missile arsenal, or intervening to effect regime change. According to the report, a 'comprehensive' scenario is also being considered, which would integrate all three objectives\u2014nuclear, missile, and regime change\u2014into a single coordinated plan.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 11:23 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0415\u041d \u0422\u0412](https://ren.tv/news/v-mire/1402210-wsj-administratsiia-trampa-obsuzhdaet-tseli-dlia-vozmozhnykh-udarov-po-iranu)\n\n**Iran threatens a regional war if US follows through on threat to strike**\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that a U.S. military strike would trigger a regional war, emphasizing that any attack would lead to widespread fallout across the Middle East. The U.S., under President Donald Trump, has deployed military assets including the USS Abraham Lincoln, bombers, and fighter jets within striking distance of Iran, with Trump stating that time is running out and that a strike would be carried out 'with great power, enthusiasm and purpose.' Iran has rejected negotiations while under threat, asserting it is not the aggressor but will respond forcefully if attacked. The country is in a weakened state after a 12-day war with Israel that destroyed key air defenses and following widespread protests crushed by a violent crackdown. Despite this, Iran retains the capability to launch significant strikes against U.S. forces, Israel, and regional allies using its ballistic missile stockpile. Arab nations like the UAE and Saudi Arabia have restricted U.S. use of their territory, signaling concerns over regional destabilization. Experts, including Syracuse University\u2019s Osamah Khalil, note that while Iran has previously threatened regional escalation, it has not demonstrated the ability or willingness to follow through\u2014though current conditions may change that calculus. The U.S. demands include Iran disposing of all enriched uranium, limiting missile range and numbers, and ending support for proxy forces\u2014demands Iran has long rejected, especially on missiles. Trump claims Iran is 'seriously talking' but negotiations face major obstacles. Senior officials are set to meet in Turkey, but progress is unlikely without the U.S. softening its 'maximalist' demands, particularly on missile programs, which Iran views as essential for national security.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:26 PM\nSource:[WBMA](https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/iran-threatens-a-regional-war-if-us-follows-through-on-threat-to-strike-protests-middle-east-conflict-tehran-nuclear-deal-missile-defense)\n\n**US-Iran negotiations expected as American military activity ramps up**\nIran and the United States are preparing for potential negotiations amid escalating military activity. Satellite imagery from February 2, 2026, showed US heavy transport aircraft, including Hercules 130J models used by US Special Forces, arriving at the Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean. This follows two separate explosions in southern Iran on January 31, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) aerospace commanders attributed to a possible US strike. On the morning of February 2, Iran's 'war room' was reported to be active and prepared to respond to any attacks, signaling readiness for potential conflict. The Tasnim News Agency reported that senior officials from both nations may meet in the coming days, likely involving Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US envoy Steve Witkoff. On February 2, Araghchi also held telephone conversations with foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt. The timing and location of the US military buildup, combined with Iran\u2019s heightened alert status, suggest a high-stakes diplomatic and military standoff.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:21 PM\nSource:[bne IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/us-iran-negotiations-expected-as-american-military-activity-ramps-up-423508/)\n\n**U.S. Military Deployment Around Iran Intensifies Amid Escalating Tensions**\nThe United States continues to expand its military deployment around Iran, with The Wall Street Journal reporting that while limited strikes on Iran are possible in the near term, a decisive attack requires further strengthening of air defense capabilities. The U.S. aims to better protect Israel and its Arab allies, as well as its own forces\u2014estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 troops\u2014stationed in Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The Pentagon is deploying additional THAAD and Patriot missile batteries across these locations. However, the U.S. faces resistance from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which on January 28, 2026, refused to allow the use of their airspace for potential U.S. strikes against Iran, fearing retaliation. Iranian threats to close the Strait of Hormuz\u2014through which 20% of global oil exports pass\u2014have heightened concerns, despite the risk to Iran\u2019s own economy. The New York Times notes the U.S. has assembled a naval 'armada' in the Arabian Sea, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and three warships equipped with Tomahawk missiles. Additionally, eight U.S. destroyers are positioned within missile defense range of Iran: two near the Strait of Hormuz, three in northern Arabia Sea, one near Israel in the Red Sea, and two in eastern Mediterranean. Aerial reinforcements include at least ten F-15E strike aircraft deployed to a Jordanian base, the same location used during the 2025 air campaign against Iran. Analysts, including Saudi editorialist Ghassan Charbel, argue that both Iran and Donald Trump have adopted inflexible postures, making de-escalation difficult without loss of face. According to Axios, Saudi Defense Minister Khaled bin Salman stated on January 30, 2026, that if Trump fails to follow through on threats, Iran would emerge stronger\u2014a shift from previous Saudi warnings against escalation, suggesting Riyadh now sees war as inevitable.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 02:30 PM\nSource:[Courrier international](https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/geopolitique-le-deploiement-americain-autour-de-l-iran-se-poursuit_240094)\n\n**U.S. Strengthens Middle East Air Defenses Amid Escalating Tensions with Iran**\nThe United States is enhancing its air defense network across the Middle East, deploying THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) and Patriot missile systems to military bases in Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), citing aircraft tracking data and satellite imagery. The move, aimed at preparing for potential retaliatory attacks from Iran following possible U.S. military action, is not an immediate indication of an impending Iranian strike. A U.S. defense official stated that if President Donald Trump issued an order, U.S. forces could conduct limited airstrikes on Iran immediately. Experts warn Iran could respond with all available firepower, targeting U.S. and Israeli bases within range, and may also employ proxy groups such as Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels or Syrian extremist factions. Regional countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have declared they will not allow their airspace or territory to be used in any U.S. attack on Iran, citing concerns over retaliatory strikes. Trump has previously signaled that a 'fleet' is heading toward Iran and hinted at military action if negotiations fail, though the timing, decision, and method of any potential strike remain unclear. The deployment reflects a pre-emptive effort to strengthen defenses ahead of possible escalation.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:53 AM\nSource:[YTN](https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0134_202602021832499491)\n\n**Shamkhani: Iran\u2019s Response to Any American Strike Will Target Israel\u2019s Heart and Alarm Regional Nations**\nAli Shamkhani, Advisor to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, stated on February 1, 2026, that any potential American strike against Iran would be met with a direct response targeting 'the heart of Israel.' He warned that regional countries must 'worry' as the conflict could rapidly expand. In an interview with Al-Medya TV, Shamkhani emphasized that Iran's message is clear: any hostile action by the enemy will be met with a proportional, effective, and deterrent response. He confirmed that Iran's retaliation includes striking deep into the Israeli entity and is not limited to maritime scenarios, noting that Tehran has prepared broader and more advanced military options for any military confrontation. Shamkhani cautioned that the inevitable expansion of war to include regional countries must be a shared concern, citing past experiences showing that conflicts in the region quickly spiral into uncontrollable, comprehensive wars. He reiterated Iran's commitment to using 'more fundamental and effective' measures to defend its national security and territorial integrity in the event of aggression. Tensions are escalating between the U.S. and Iran amid Trump's announcements of a massive military fleet deployment toward Iran and threats of non-diplomatic options if no agreement is reached. Simultaneously, media reports indicate the U.S. has informed its Middle Eastern allies of a possible military strike on Iran within days, raising fears of a regional escalation. In response, Iran threatens an unprecedented retaliation that could target U.S. bases and Israel, while regional actors are attempting mediation efforts to prevent a full-scale confrontation, with Gulf states maintaining cautious stances and refusing to allow their airspace or waters for any military action against Iran.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 08:01 AM\nSource:[journalistesfaxien.tn](https://journalistesfaxien.tn/%d8%b4%d9%85%d8%ae%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a5%d9%8a%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89-%d8%a3%d9%8a-%d8%b6%d8%b1%d8%a8%d8%a9-%d8%a3%d9%85%d8%b1%d9%8a%d9%83/)\n\n**The War Zone: U.S. Could Strike Iran On Jan. 31 Or Feb. 1**\nThe U.S. military is awaiting a decision from former President Donald Trump regarding a potential strike on Iran, scheduled for January 31 or February 1, according to The War Zone, citing a senior Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) official.

Israeli authorities have warned foreign airlines of a 'heightened risk of danger' in the skies on those dates. Sources cited by Middle East Eye indicate the target would be high-ranking Iranian officials and commanders linked to the deaths of protesters.

The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) announced the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group to the Middle East, emphasizing the mission to enhance regional security and stability. U.S. Central Command Commander General Brad Cooper stated that the U.S. military is prepared for a 'short, swift, and clean' operation inside Iran, though full readiness requires time. He added that any potential strike would target individuals responsible for harming protesters. Israeli military leadership confirmed coordination talks with the U.S. regarding potential ballistic missile threats, with Israel monitoring U.S. troop movements in the Gulf and preparing for possible attack scenarios, though the exact direction of events remains unclear. Iran\u2019s military asserted that any threat to its national security is monitored from its earliest stages, and that responses will be made in due time based on precise field assessments. A senior Iranian military official dismissed the idea of a surprise, limited strike as a misrepresentation of Iran\u2019s defensive and offensive capabilities, warning such a scenario would quickly spiral out of control. Iran also downplayed the significance of the U.S. military presence, claiming full control over the maritime environment around Iran and accusing foreign forces of increasing their vulnerability. Iran emphasized it would not initiate war but would prevent any threat from progressing to execution, holding the provocateur fully responsible for unintended consequences. Simultaneously, regional factions issued strong statements: Hezbollah\u2019s Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah declared the group would not remain neutral if Iran were attacked, stating any threat to Iran is a direct threat to the entire resistance axis. In Iraq, Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi of Kataib Hezbollah warned that war against Iran would not be a 'joke' and called on 'mujahideen' to prepare for a comprehensive war, including defensive suicide operations if a jihad declaration is issued. In Yemen, the Houthi military media announced a strike on the British ship MV Marlin Lwanda in the Gulf of Aden using a locally made 'Al-Bahr Al-Ahmar' missile, showcasing their ability to target vessels in previously restricted maritime zones. Meanwhile, the UAE reaffirmed its commitment to not allowing its territory, airspace, or waters to be used for any military action against Iran or for logistical support, stressing that dialogue, de-escalation, international law, and sovereignty are essential for resolving crises, with diplomatic means as the only acceptable path. The convergence of these developments on a single day indicates a new phase of regional tension, with possibilities of limited escalation or broader confrontation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 04:06 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u062e\u0628\u0631\u0646\u064a](https://www.khaberni.com/news/775946-4-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A6%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%9F)\n\n**Iran-US tensions LIVE: Tehran on edge as US aircraft carrier reaches Middle East; Hezbollah sounds caution**\nTensions between Iran and the United States escalated on January 27, 2026, as a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group, led by the USS Abraham Lincoln, moved closer to Iran, raising fears of a potential military attack. The United Arab Emirates publicly ruled out allowing its airspace, land, or territorial waters to be used for any military operations against Iran, emphasizing dialogue, de-escalation, and respect for sovereignty. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reportedly relocated to a special underground shelter in Tehran amid concerns of a U.S. strike, with his third son, Masoud Khamenei, reportedly assuming day-to-day management of his office, according to Iran International. Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem expressed concern over U.S. threats, stating the group is 'targeted by potential aggression' and that it would decide later whether to intervene, but stressed, 'we are not neutral.' Meanwhile, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported that nearly 6,000 people\u2014protesters, children, and civilians\u2014have been killed in Iran\u2019s nationwide crackdown on protests that began in late December 2025 and intensified on January 8, 2026, with the actual death toll possibly higher due to internet restrictions. Iran\u2019s government reported a significantly lower figure of 3,117 deaths, but this cannot be independently verified.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:28 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-us-tensions-live-updates-news-tehran-trump-khamenei-warning-protests-us-fleet-abraham-lincoln-war-latest-news-101769479810918.html)\n\n**Iran Enters Alert State Amid U.S. Military Buildup in the Middle East**\nThe Iranian government has entered a state of alert due to the deployment of U.S. military assets, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, to the Middle East, raising fears of a potential military attack backed by Israel. Analysts note that U.S. forces are now within operational range to strike Iranian territory, despite not yet being fully positioned. The Pentagon has conducted military exercises in the region to demonstrate combat air power mobilization and sustainment capabilities. This move comes amid internal instability in Iran, marked by violent crackdowns on ongoing protests. Western officials believe the U.S., in coordination with Israel, has sufficient firepower to launch a large-scale offensive aimed at weakening or toppling the Iranian regime. However, experts caution that such an attack may not reignite popular uprisings, as many Iranian critics of the clerical regime oppose foreign-imposed regime change. Regional countries like the UAE have denied allowing the use of their airspace or territorial waters for any attack, but the U.S. presence in the Mediterranean reduces reliance on such permissions. The Iranian stock market recorded its largest single-day drop in history, and inflation reached 60% in the last month, worsening public discontent. Protest-related deaths remain uncertain, with Human Rights Activists reporting 5,419 fatalities and 17,000 more under investigation\u2014claims denied by Iran\u2019s government, which also refuted allegations that families were forced to pay $5,000\u2013$7,000 to recover bodies. Internet access has been severely restricted since January 8, with the Communications Ministry admitting disruptions cannot exceed 20 days but maintaining the blackout, deepening information isolation. Unlike past conflicts, any potential strike would target Iran\u2019s political leadership rather than its nuclear program, which is already weakened. Ali Larijani, Iran\u2019s National Security Council secretary, accused the U.S. of attempting to undermine social cohesion through hybrid warfare, calling protesters 'terrorist-like' and claiming they aim to provoke civil war. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei denied any ongoing dialogue with Washington, dismissing claims that U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff was in contact with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Baghaei warned that military threats violate international law and vowed a 'complete and regrettable' response to any aggression. Iran\u2019s judiciary chief, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, publicly urged against returning to negotiations with the U.S. President Donald Trump previously delayed an offensive due to lack of a clear plan to remove Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and insufficient guarantees for Israel\u2019s security. Internal U.S. divisions persist over whether to pursue regime change in a country of nearly 90 million people.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 09:11 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/ira-entra-em-alerta-apos-movimentacao-militar-dos-eua-no-oriente-medio/)\n\n**Iran Will Treat any Attack as 'All-out War against Us,' Says Senior Iran Official**\nA senior Iranian official stated on January 24, 2026, that Iran would treat any attack\u2014regardless of scale or nature\u2014as an 'all-out war' and respond with maximum force, citing the impending arrival of a US military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East. The official, speaking anonymously, emphasized that Iran remains on high alert and is prepared for the worst-case scenario, noting that the US military buildup 'we hope is not intended for real confrontation.' The official reiterated that any violation of Iran's sovereignty or territorial integrity would trigger a strong response, though he declined to specify the nature of such a response. The statement comes amid heightened regional tensions, with US President Donald Trump previously warning Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program, while also stating the US had an 'armada' heading toward Iran but hoped it would not have to be used. The US has historically deployed additional forces to the region during periods of tension, including a major buildup prior to its June 2025 strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. The Iranian official argued that a country under constant military threat from the US has no choice but to ensure all available means are ready to counter aggression and restore strategic balance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 09:15 AM\nSource:[Asharq Al-Awsat](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5233115)\n\n**This Is the Possible Scenario of a U.S. Strike Against Iran**\nAccording to reports from the 'Wall Street Journal' and 'New York Times', the U.S. military has completed preparations for a potential strike against Iran, which could involve a combination of naval and air forces launching rapid, precise attacks deep into Iranian territory. U.S. destroyers equipped with Tomahawk missiles are deployed in the Middle East, capable of launching long-range strikes up to 1,600 kilometers, enabling attacks without entering Iranian territorial waters. Additionally, a U.S. submarine is stationed in the Arabian Sea or northern Indian Ocean to provide surprise by launching missiles from unexpected directions, complicating Iran\u2019s early detection capabilities. In the air, the U.S. could deploy long-range bombers and aircraft flying directly from U.S. bases, requiring 12 to 20 hours of flight time to reach airspace near Iran, allowing a strike to be executed within hours without prolonged public mobilization. This buildup is accompanied by increasing U.S. military presence in the region, including the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier shifting from the South China Sea toward the Middle East, enhancing aerial strike capacity and providing defensive cover for the fleet. Meanwhile, Israel has raised its alert level in anticipation of developments. According to NBC News, citing a U.S. official and two individuals familiar with internal discussions, former President Donald Trump instructed his national security team to pursue a swift, decisive strike aimed at toppling the Iranian regime without triggering a prolonged war lasting weeks or months. However, Trump\u2019s advisers have not yet provided assurances that the regime would collapse quickly after a strike.
