Analysis:

1) Resolution/option paraphrase (≤30 words)
A US military (not CIA) kinetic strike counts if a US weapon detonates/discharges on/over Iranian territory/airspace/territorial waters; cyber alone doesn’t count. Windows: <11 May 2026; 11 May–9 Sep 2026; 10 Sep 2026–9 Jan 2027; otherwise.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinions)

High-quality / primary mainstream reporting
- BBC (Jan 28, 2026): High reliability. Facts: significant US force posture in region; aircraft and air-defense movements; carrier strike group redeployed; June 2025 “Operation Midnight Hammer” precedent. Opinions: RUSI’s Matthew Savill on feasible targets/limits; OSINT analyst inference (“sooner rather than later”).
- CNN (Jan 28, 2026): High reliability, well-sourced. Facts: talks via Oman stalled; Trump considering new strike packages; specific US preconditions; force movements (Patriot/THAAD planning; carrier movement). Opinions: characterization of Trump’s intent (“declare victory”), but attributed to officials.
- WSJ (Jan 11, 2026) and WSJ excerpts echoed in other outlets (late Jan/early Feb): High reliability. Key factual signal: US officials saying strikes “not imminent” and Pentagon prioritizing air defenses to absorb retaliation before any major action.
- NYT (Jan 30, 2026): High reliability. Facts: expanded menu of options including raids; protests currently “brutally quashed” (context); no authorization yet. Opinions: implied use of threats for leverage—attributed to officials.

Lower-to-mixed quality / secondary, translated, or analysis-heavy
- Democracy Now! (Feb 4, 2026): Generally reliable on the basic deployment announcement and sanctions; less granular military detail. Mostly facts; limited forecasting value beyond confirming posture/diplomacy.
- Courrier International / YTN (Feb 2, 2026) / L’Express (Feb 3, 2026): Secondary reporting drawing on WSJ/US officials; useful corroboration. Facts: air defense deployments, Gulf state constraints, “not imminent” framing; opinions: “brink of war” tone.
- Globo/G1 citing ISW (Feb 4, 2026): Credible if it accurately relays ISW and CENTCOM statements. Facts: Feb 3 drone shootdown near carrier; tanker harassment/interception attempt; order of events. ISW interpretation (“testing response”) is analytical opinion.
- bne IntelliNews (Feb 2, 2026): Mixed; often good regional monitoring but sometimes speculative. Facts: observed aircraft movements to Diego Garcia; claims of “possible US strike” inferred from Iranian statements are weaker.
- Bankingnews.gr (Feb 3, 2026): Low-to-moderate reliability; “brink of war” narrative; treat as color, not core evidence.
- Charter97 / “War Zone may strike Jan 31/Feb 1” relay (Jan 27, 2026): Weak. It describes a specific near-term strike window that is now past without widely-accepted confirmation; could reflect contingency planning, signaling, or rumor.
- Iranian media quotes (Tasnim/officials relayed via various sources; Shamkhani/Larijani statements): Useful for intent and red lines, but strategic messaging; facts about Iranian capability should be discounted unless independently corroborated.

Key technicality check: the Feb 3 US shootdown of an Iranian drone occurred over international waters (Arabian Sea). That is NOT a qualifying “strike within” Iranian territory/airspace/territorial waters for this question.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (large-ish shifts)
1) Broad, multi-source confirmation of major US force posture + defensive preparations (BBC/CNN/WSJ/NYT; echoed by secondary outlets). Mechanism: increased capability + reduced marginal cost/time-to-strike once positioned.
2) Credible WSJ line: “strikes not imminent” because force protection (Patriot/THAAD) is being strengthened first. Mechanism: implies sequencing—defenses, then (if diplomacy fails) offensive option.
3) A defined diplomatic “decision point” very soon (talks reported for Feb 6 in multiple places). Mechanism: deadline dynamics can accelerate escalation after a failed round.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
4) Direct kinetic friction events on Feb 3 (drone shot down; tanker harassment). Mechanism: miscalculation/retaliation spiral raises short-horizon risk, even if leadership prefers restraint.
5) Gulf partners restricting airspace/territory use (Saudi/UAE). Mechanism: raises operational/political cost, but doesn’t preclude standoff weapons, carrier aviation, submarines, or bombers from outside the Gulf.

Weak evidence (small adjustments)
6) Specific rumors of strike dates (Jan 31/Feb 1) and ambiguous “explosions” in Iran attributed by IRGC to possible US action. Without strong, open-source corroboration that a US weapon detonated/discharged on/over Iran, this is not decision-grade evidence.

Net effect vs outside view:
- Outside view had a strong “not imminent” drag on near-term (Option A). I keep that drag, but the combination of (i) a near-term diplomatic cliff (Feb 6), (ii) continuing force posture, and (iii) rising tactical friction nudges probability mass earlier (A/B) relative to D.

(c) Timeframe analysis
From today (Feb 4, 2026):
- Option A: 96 days (to May 11, 2026)
- Option B: additional 121 days (to Sep 9, 2026)
- Option C: additional 122 days (to Jan 9, 2027)
- Option D: beyond 339 days total

If the remaining horizon were halved (only ~5–6 months total), I would shift mass from D into A/B (more “now-or-never” crisis dynamics). If doubled (~22 months), I’d shift more into D (more chances for de-escalation cycles, leadership turnover, and “can-kicking,” despite more opportunity for shocks).

(d) Justification: inside-view adjustments from outside-view base rates

Outside-view baseline (given): [8, 22, 18, 52].

Reasons to move probability earlier than baseline:
- The situation is not “generic US–Iran tension.” There is a recent precedent (June 2025 US strikes) plus an unusually dense, corroborated force posture near Iran now (carrier, destroyers, ISR aircraft, air defenses moving in). This makes “attempting a strike” operationally easier than in most years in the reference class.
- The Feb 6 talks create a near-term forcing function. Failed diplomacy often increases short-run risk because leaders can claim they “tried talks” before acting.
- Tactical incidents (drone shootdown; maritime harassment) increase the chance of rapid escalation even without an initial desire for war.

Reasons not to move too much into Option A:
- High-quality reporting (WSJ and echoed elsewhere) says major strikes are “not imminent,” tied to a clear institutional constraint: force protection (THAAD/Patriot posture) and managing retaliation risk to US forces and partners.
- Regional basing/overflight constraints (Saudi/UAE) raise the political cost and complicate planning, pushing timing later unless there is a trigger that overrides constraints.

Blind-spot / upset scenario (and how it would change things)
Most likely to make this forecast look silly: a limited US strike (e.g., standoff missiles from ships/subs or a one-off raid) occurs but is only credibly reported days/weeks later—after which the “not imminent” narrative is revealed as deliberate operational deception. This would push probability sharply into Option A (and somewhat B) at the expense of D.

Probability calibration

I shift ~11 points of probability mass from Option D into Options A and B (and a small rebalancing of C), reflecting: (1) heightened immediate friction + diplomatic cliff, (2) still-credible sequencing constraints that make B the modal “if it happens” window rather than A.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase checked: must be US military kinetic discharge/detonation on/over Iranian territory/airspace/territorial waters; cyber alone excluded; no public acknowledgment required.
2) Outside view base rates used: [8, 22, 18, 52].
3) Consistency: Most likely = Not before 9 Jan 2027; least likely = Before 11 May 2026; aligns with “not imminent” but elevated near-term risk.
4) Key evidence (≤20 words each):
   - WSJ: US officials say strikes “not imminent,” prioritizing THAAD/Patriot deployments.
   - Multi-source: major US carrier/air/ISR buildup within strike range.
   - Feb 6 talks as a near-term decision point; failure could accelerate action.
   - Feb 3 drone shootdown + tanker harassment raises miscalculation/escalation risk.
5) Blind spot: covert/deniable limited strike later credibly reported; would increase Option A materially.
6) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100, ordered correctly.
