Analysis
(a) Source analysis (quality & facts vs. opinion – abridged)

1. BBC 28 Jan 26 – Factual recap of June 25 strikes, current U.S. deployments (sat-imagery confirmed).  High reliability. Opinions: RUSI analyst on strike feasibility.  
2. CNN 28 Jan 26 – Multiple U.S. officials; carrier location, options list.  Good reliability; opinions confined to officials’ assessments.  
3. WSJ 11 Jan 26 & 30 Jan 26 – Details of Tuesday briefing, THAAD/Patriot moves; unnamed Pentagon sources say “air-strikes not imminent.”  High for logistics data, moderate for intent inference.  
4. Democracy Now 4 Feb 26 – Confirms carrier redeployment, new sanctions.  Low-moderate reliability for military detail; mainly advocacy.  
5. AskNews pack (Feb 1-4 26) – Independent media reports of drone shoot-down, tanker harassment, Gulf allies refusing basing.  Factual events geo-located by CENTCOM; high reliability. Opinions: “war inevitable” pieces = speculative.  
6. Historical reference (1987-88, 2025) – Public record, high reliability.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong
• Large, verified U.S. force build-up (carrier, extra aircraft, missile-defence batteries) – multiple independent sources.  
• June 2025 precedent shows taboo broken; historically strikes cluster after first incident (1987-88).  

Moderate
• Trump rhetoric & repeated option briefings – single decision-maker, but past pattern of brinkmanship without follow-through.  
• Iran viewed as weakened internally, raising temptation for coercive strike – intelligence leaks, but indirect.  

Weak
• Israeli/IDF anonymous “strike on 31 Jan/1 Feb” reports – date already passed.  
• Speculation that tanker/drone incidents are deliberate Iranian escalation triggers.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon to 9 Jan 27 ≈ 340 days.  If that horizon were halved (≈170 d), I’d cut total strike probability from 35 % to about 23 % (force already in theatre).  If doubled (≈680 d), probability would rise only slightly to ~40 % because political context may shift after U.S. mid-terms and Iranian succession questions.

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view baseline (7 / 9 / 8 / 76 %) came from long-run rarity with a 24 % conditional chance over the next 11 months.

Factors pushing upward  
+ Robust strike-capable posture already in place (strong evidence).  
+ 2025 strike demonstrates current administration’s willingness (strong).  
+ Talks are stalling; U.S. public threats escalating; decision concentrated in one leader (moderate).  

Factors restraining  
– Allies (UAE, SA) deny basing; THAAD/Patriot bolstering suggests defensive priority (moderate).  
– Pentagon leaks stress “not ready for decisive strike yet”; focus on deterrence (moderate).  
– High retaliation risk, oil-price shock, and election-cycle caution (moderate).  

Net effect: raise aggregate strike probability from 24 % to roughly 37 %.  Distribution front-loads to the first window because (i) forces are peaking now, (ii) miscalculation risk highest when assets interact (recent drone/tanker episodes), and (iii) talks could collapse within weeks.

Probability calibration
Before 11 May 2026 (≈ 3 mo): 15 %  
11 May–9 Sep 2026 (≈ 4 mo): 12 %  
10 Sep 2026–9 Jan 2027 (≈ 4 mo): 10 %  
Not before 9 Jan 2027: 63 %  
Sum = 100.

Checklist (short)
1. Options: any U.S. kinetic strike on/over Iran counted; four date ranges up to 9 Jan 27.  
2. Base-rate used (7/9/8/76) then adjusted upward to 15/12/10/63.  
3. Most likely = “Not before 9 Jan 27”; least = “Sep–Jan”; aligns with logic.  
4. Key evidence: 2025 precedent; current carrier + 8 destroyers; THAAD/Patriot surge (defensive tilt); allies refuse basing; Pentagon says “not imminent.”  
5. Blind-spot: Iranian shoot-down of U.S. asset inside Iranian airspace triggering immediate U.S. retaliation sooner than expected (would raise option 1).  
6. Probabilities numeric, sum 100.

Probabilities: [15, 12, 10, 63]
