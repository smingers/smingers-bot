Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. BBC, 30 Jan 2026 – Reputable, dateline-correct. Facts: arrival of USS Abraham Lincoln, recap of June 2025 U.S. strike, current Iranian unrest. Opinions: BBC analyst’s view that escalation risk is higher now.  
2. Al Jazeera, 31 Jan 2026 – Major international outlet, recent. Facts: U.S.–Iran communication channel, Iranian naval drill, Saudi/Turkish/Qatari diplomacy. Opinions: correspondent’s description of situation as “fragile”.  
3. Jerusalem Post, 30 Jan 2026 – Regional paper, occasionally hawkish on Iran. Facts: entry of destroyer USS Delbert D. Black, quoted Trump remarks, reported menu of U.S. strike options, new IRGC drones. Opinions: Israeli sources urging joint strike, Citi Bank probability table.  
4. Times of India video citing WSJ, 31 Jan 2026 – Secondary aggregation. Facts (attributed to WSJ): Pentagon sees regional-defence gaps, THAAD/Patriot rush. Opinions: headline “not ready for war” – interpretive.  
5. Wall Street Journal, 1 Feb 2026 – First-tier U.S. newspaper. Facts: carrier group in theatre, F-35 forward deployment, additional air-defence moves, officials say “decisive attack” not imminent. Opinions: none beyond officials’ characterisation.  
6. Agent report – Compiled chronology of confirmed U.S. kinetic strikes on Iran (1987, 1988, 1988, 2025) and abstract of present planning-rumours. Factual portions cite mainstream or academic sources; analytical parts are author opinion.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. U.S. kinetic strikes on Iran, 1979-2025 (4 events in 47 years).  
2. U.S. limited punitive strikes on “regional adversaries” (Libya 1986/2011, Iraq limited raids 1993-1998, Syria 2017/2018, Iran 4 above) ≈ 10 events in 40 years.  
3. All U.S. uses of force worldwide (numerous; too broad).  

Class 1 lines up exactly with the forecast target and avoids contamination by differing strategic logics (e.g., humanitarian intervention).  Its small-n problem is mitigated by the long span (47 yrs).  I adopt Class 1.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window: today (4 Feb 2026) to 9 Jan 2027 → 340 days.  
Base-rate from Class 1: 4 strikes / 17 222 days = 0.0232 strikes per 100 days = 8.5 % probability per calendar year.  Extrapolated to 340 days: 8.5 % × (340/365) ≈ 7.9 %.  Distribution within the window is unknowable from the outside view, so equal probability density per day is the neutral assumption.

(d) Justification  
1.  The U.S.–Iran strike frequency (once every 12 years on average) yields a base probability of ~8 % in the next 11 months.  
2.  No obvious cyclic or seasonal pattern in the historical four strikes; therefore, a flat temporal prior is reasonable.  
3.  Forward deployment (carrier, destroyers) and rhetoric are noteworthy but have recurred without producing strikes (e.g., 2007, 2019); an outside-view model deliberately does not overweight current headlines.  
4.  Historical Iranian retaliation has been limited, so U.S. leaders have not required long build-ups for past strikes; timing after visible preparations has ranged from hours (1987) to weeks (2025).  Hence, if a strike were to materialise, it could arrive at any point in the forecast horizon with roughly equal chance.  

Outside view calibration:

• Target probability mass for a strike by 9 Jan 2027: 8 % (rounded).  
• Divide evenly over the three mutually-exclusive sub-intervals (97 days, 122 days, 121 days) → ~2.3 % / 2.9 % / 2.8 %.  
• Remainder (92 %) assigned to “Not before 9 Jan 2027”.  
• Historical record has one genuine “surprise” (1988 shoot-down), suggesting low-frequency tail risks; keeping 8 % aggregate leaves room for such upsets without becoming overconfident.

Outside View Prediction:
Before 11 May 2026: 2%  
Between 11 May 2026 and 9 September 2026: 3%  
Between 10 September 2026 and 9 January 2027: 3%  
Not before 9 January 2027: 92%
