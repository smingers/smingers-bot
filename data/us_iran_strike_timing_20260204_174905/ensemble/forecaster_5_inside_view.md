Analysis
(a) Source analysis (abridged)

1. BBC (28 Jan 26) – Highly reliable; factual force-posture imagery, on-record statements; opinion from RUSI expert.  
2. CNN (28 Jan 26) – Mainstream US outlet; multiple officials quoted; details current options and internal debate.  
3. WSJ (11 Jan 26 & 30 Jan 26) – Strong defence desk; force-deployment facts, anonymous officials; some speculation.  
4. NYT (30 Jan 26) – Similar to WSJ; enlarged strike menu, stresses no decision yet; high quality.  
5. Democracy Now!/Globo/Courrier Intl/YTN (1–4 Feb 26) – Secondary outlets re-reporting CENTCOM & WSJ facts; good for factual troop movements.  
6. AskNews digests (Jan 27–Feb 4 26) – Mixed regional media; cross-checks with Western outlets confirm force build-up, ally reluctance, Iranian threats.  Low weight for timing rumours (“Jan 31 strike”) that have already proven false.

Across sources, the hard facts (carrier arrival, THAAD/Patriot moves, drone shoot-down, Gulf-ally air-space refusal) are multiply confirmed; timing predictions rely on single anonymous leaks – moderate at best.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
• Large, confirmed US force build-up in theatre (multisource SAT imagery & Pentagon releases).  
• Public presidential threats linking Iranian behaviour to possible strike.  
• Historical pattern: when US assembles carrier + long-range bombers near Iran and issues red-line threats, strike probability in ensuing 12 m ≈40 % (4/10 crises).

Moderate evidence  
• Officials briefing expanded target lists but also emphasising “no decision yet”.  
• Deployment of extra air-defence assets suggests Pentagon expects Iranian retaliation and wants a buffer window of “weeks”.  
• Saudi/UAE refusal to allow basing or over-flight complicates (but does not preclude) air campaign.

Weak evidence  
• Israeli “War Zone” leak of 31 Jan/1 Feb strike date (already passed).  
• Speculative claims of Supreme Leader relocating to bunker.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Horizon to question close: 11 weeks for first bin, then 17 weeks, then 17 weeks, then 49 weeks.  Hazard is front-loaded while build-up is fresh, but if talks fail yet strike delayed for air-defence completion, risk spills into second window.  If horizon were halved (to late-Aug 26), I would compress probability into the first two bins (25 → 33 %, 12 → 17 %).  If doubled (to 2028) I would shift weight to later, lowering early windows by ~1/3.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start from outside-view distribution 8 / 9 / 8 / 75.  
Up-adjust overall strike chance because:  
+ Force posture & rhetoric match past pre-strike crises (+10 ppts).  
+ Domestic pressure to “be decisive” amid Iranian crackdown (+3).  
Counter-pressure:  
– Still-open diplomatic track; Trump precedent of bluster without war (2019, 2020, 2023) (-6).  
– Operational friction: ally air-space denial, need to emplace extra THAAD/Patriot (-2).  
Net probability of any strike before 9 Jan 27 ~44 %.  Distribute with a decaying hazard (spike now, taper later):

Before 11 May 26 (97 d) … 25 %  
11 May–9 Sep 26 ……………… 12 %  
10 Sep 26–9 Jan 27 ………… 7 %  
Not before 9 Jan 27 ………… 56 %

Probability calibration
Shifts of ±10 % in any bin would require either (a) collapse/breakthrough in 6 Feb talks, or (b) credible report of presidential order signed (upward), or Pentagon stand-down (downward).  Blind-spot: rapid tit-for-tat escalation from another theatre (Iraq, Syria) triggering an unplanned, limited US strike that qualifies – this could bump the first window by ~10 ppts.

Checklist
1. Options: US military kinetic strike on/over Iranian territory: (1) ≤10 May 26; (2) 11 May–9 Sep 26; (3) 10 Sep 26–9 Jan 27; (4) later/never.  
2. Base rate 8/9/8/75 – yes.  
3. Most likely = “Not before 9 Jan 27”; least likely = “10 Sep–9 Jan 27” – consistent with rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) Carrier & bomber build-up, b) White House threat rhetoric, c) THAAD/Patriot deployments (implies weeks’ cushion), d) Ally air-space denial, e) Ongoing 6 Feb talks.  
5. Blind-spot: Localised clash (e.g., Iraq militia rocket attack killing US troops) triggers immediate cross-border retaliation qualifying as “strike”.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100 and within 0–100.

Probabilities: [25, 12, 7, 56]
