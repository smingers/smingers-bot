You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
When will the US' national military forces attempt to execute a military strike within the territory, airspace, or territorial waters of Iran?

The options are: ['Before 11 May 2026', 'Between 11 May 2026 and 9 September 2026', 'Between 10 September 2026 and 9 January 2027', 'Not before 9 January 2027']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
The geographic origin of and weaponry used in a military strike will be
immaterial so long as either the weapon detonates or discharges on or over
Iranian territory. A cyberattack alone will not count.

For the purposes of this question, US national military forces exclude US
intelligence services (e.g., CIA).

Public acknowledgment is not required, and the default evidentiary standard
would be used, that being credible, open-source media reporting.

# Summary of BBC Article: "Why Iran's response to a US attack could be different this time"

**Date:** January 30, 2026

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Military Deployment:** The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has arrived in the US Central Command area of responsibility, close to Iranian waters.

2. **Previous US-Iran Military Exchanges:**
   - **June 21-22, 2025:** US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities
   - **June 2025 (day after strikes):** Iran responded with a missile attack on US-operated Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Iran provided advance warning; most missiles were intercepted; no casualties reported.
   - **January 3, 2020:** US assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani near Baghdad airport
   - **January 2020 (5 days later):** Iran retaliated by firing missiles at US Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq with advance warning. No US personnel killed, but dozens later reported traumatic brain injuries.

3. **Domestic Unrest in Iran:**
   - Protests erupted in late December 2025 and early January 2026
   - Human rights organizations and medical workers report several thousand people killed, with many more injured or detained (exact numbers cannot be verified)
   - Internet blackout has continued for more than two weeks
   - On January 8-9, 2026, security forces reportedly lost control of parts of several towns and neighborhoods in major cities before reasserting authority
   - Protests have diminished but not ended

4. **Iranian Official Statements:**
   - Iranian authorities deny responsibility for deaths, blaming "terrorist groups" and accusing Israel of fomenting unrest
   - Iran's secretary of the Supreme National Security Council framed protests as a continuation of "last summer's 12-day war with Israel"
   - Senior commanders in Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, regular armed forces, and political officials have warned that any US attack would be treated as an act of war

5. **US Statements:**
   - President Trump warned Iranian authorities against using violence against protesters
   - Trump told Iranians "help is coming" at the height of the unrest

## Analysis from the Article (attributed to BBC):

- **Changed Context:** Iran's current situation differs markedly from previous confrontations due to severe internal strain from domestic protests
- **Historical Pattern:** Tehran previously showed preference for delayed and limited retaliation, attempting to signal resolve while avoiding wider war
- **Current Risk Assessment:** Any US attack now carries significantly higher risk of rapid escalation, both regionally and inside Iran
- **Potential Scenarios:**
  - Limited US strike could provide Iranian authorities pretext for further internal repression
  - Broader US campaign that weakens Iranian state could push country toward chaos and prolonged instability
- **Regional Risk:** A rapid Iranian response would place Gulf states hosting US forces and Israel at immediate risk
- **Strategic Constraints:** Trump aware Iran is militarily weaker than before last summer's 12-day war; Tehran aware Trump has little appetite for full-scale, open-ended conflict
- **Changed Response Pattern:** Iran's previous model of delayed, symbolic retaliation may no longer be sufficient if leaders believe speed is essential to reassert deterrence and internal control

# Summary of Article: "US, Iran signal talks to avert military conflict amid tensions in the Gulf"

**Source:** Al Jazeera  
**Date Context:** Article describes current/recent events (Saturday statements referenced)

## Key Facts and Developments:

**Confirmed Communications:**
- Both Iran and the US have confirmed opening lines of communication to work out a deal and avoid military action
- President Trump stated Iran is "seriously talking" with Washington
- Ali Larijani (head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council) said "the formation of a framework for negotiations is progressing"

**Military Posture:**
- US "armada" led by USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is heading towards Iran
- Trump referenced "very big, powerful ships heading in that direction"
- Earlier in the week, Trump said US vessels were ready to use "violence, if necessary" if Iran refused talks on its nuclear program
- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) plans to hold a two-day naval exercise in the Strait of Hormuz

**US Military Warning:**
- US Central Command (CENTCOM) warned the IRGC on Friday about the planned naval exercises
- CENTCOM stated: "Any unsafe and unprofessional behavior near US forces, regional partners or commercial vessels increases risks of collision, escalation, and destabilization"

**Iranian Position:**
- Senior Iranian leaders are open to negotiations but only after Trump stops threatening to attack
- Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi criticized US military presence off Iran's shores, calling it contradictory for the US to request "professionalism" from an organization it designated as "terrorist"
- Araghchi stated: "The presence of outside forces in our region has always caused the exact opposite of what is declared: promoting escalation instead of de-escalation"

**Regional Diplomatic Efforts:**
- Qatar: Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani met Larijani in Tehran on Saturday to discuss de-escalation efforts
- Saudi Arabia: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday that Riyadh would not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran
- Turkey, UAE, and Saudi Arabia are engaging in diplomatic efforts to prevent military confrontation
- Turkey (NATO member sharing border with Iran) opposes foreign intervention and has called for US-Iran dialogue

**Situational Assessment:**
- Al Jazeera's Tohid Asadi described the situation as "quite fragile and delicate" but noted Larijani's statement as a "positive" sign
- Tensions have been rising for weeks over Trump's threats related to Iran's crackdown on antigovernment protests and its nuclear program

**Disclaimer:** The extracted content appears to be incomplete or mismatched with the article headline. The headline references "U.S. Bows Down To Iran's Big Demand After Drone Action; Military Strike Aborted, Nuke Deal Next?" but the provided article content discusses Pakistan's exclusion from a Global Minerals Conference and an India-US trade deal. There is no content about Iran, military strikes, drone actions, or nuclear deals in the extracted text.

**Summary:**

The article content as provided contains no information relevant to the forecasting question about US military strikes on Iran. Instead, it covers two unrelated topics:

1. **Pakistan and Global Minerals Conference:** Former Pakistani envoy Abdul Basit noted that Pakistan was not invited to the Global Minerals Conference despite previously showcasing rare earth minerals to President Trump. India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will attend the Critical Minerals Ministerial in the US. The article suggests this reflects India's stronger policy approach to supply chain resilience and long-term partnerships, while Pakistan faces a strategic setback.

2. **India-US Trade Deal:** Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal defended the India-US trade deal in Parliament, claiming it protects India's agriculture and dairy sectors while providing tariff advantages for Indian exporters. He stated the deal will boost labor-intensive sectors, MSMEs, and opportunities for Indian professionals in the US, while facing political scrutiny from the opposition.

**No facts, statistics, or opinions relevant to the Iran military strike question were found in the provided content.**

# Summary of Jerusalem Post Article (January 30, 2026)

## Key Facts and Developments:

**US Military Movements:**
- A new US naval destroyer (USS Delbert D. Black) entered the Middle East within the past 48 hours (as of January 30, 2026)
- This brings the total US naval presence to: 6 destroyers, 1 aircraft carrier, and 3 littoral combat ships
- The destroyer anchored at the Port of Eilat on Friday
- The IDF stated this was routine, pre-planned operations

**Trump Statements:**
- Trump confirmed he is planning to speak with Iran
- He stated: "We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them"
- Trump claimed he had held talks with Iran in "recent days"
- He told the Iranians two things: "no nukes, and stop killing the protesters. They will have to do something"

**Military Options Under Consideration:**
According to The New York Times (as cited in the article):
- Trump is weighing multiple options for military action against Iran
- His preference is to strike Iranian leaders who threatened him personally
- Options include:
  - Sending commando units to Iranian nuclear sites not already destroyed
  - Launching attacks against Iran's military and leadership to cause upheaval and enable regime change
- Israel is pushing the US to join in a widespread attack on Iranian ballistic missile capabilities

**Iranian Preparations:**
- The IRGC received a batch of 1,000 new drones
- According to informed sources in Tehran (via Hezbollah-aligned Al-Akhbar): Tehran believes meeting US demands would be more costly than war

**Diplomatic Efforts:**
- US Middle East partners (Turkey, Oman, and Qatar) are urging the Trump administration to pursue diplomatic talks instead of military strikes
- The opportunity for direct diplomacy has "not gained traction" according to three regional officials speaking to CBS News anonymously

**Financial Analysis - Citi Bank Assessment:**
- **Base case (70% probability):** US and Israel take limited actions against Iran that avoid escalatory response, including limited US military actions and oil tanker seizures
- **30% probability:** Heightened but limited conflict with intermittent disruptions to oil production
- **10% probability:** Substantial regional supply losses
- Citi expects limited Iranian response as Iran "does not want war either, as it is facing a faltering economy and civil unrest"
- Citi expects a US-Iran deal and de-escalation at some point in 2026
- Current Iran-related geopolitical risk premium: $7-10 per barrel with Brent near $70
- Oil prices climbed 3% to a five-month high on Thursday (January 29, 2026) on concerns about potential US attacks

**Oil Market Data:**
- Brent futures settled at $70.71 a barrel on Thursday

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a chronological list of every confirmed instance since 1979 in which US national military forces executed a kinetic strike on, over, or within the territorial waters of Iran, including June 2025, and summarize immediate Iranian and US responses.  Then assess any credible reporting (Nov 2025–Feb 2026) about new strike planning.
Chronology of U.S. kinetic action against Iran, 1979-June 2025  
(Only episodes for which contemporaneous, open-source evidence is available in the supplied search results.)

1. 19 October 1987 – Operation Nimble Archer  
   • Action: Four U.S. destroyers fired more than 1,000 5-inch rounds at two Iranian offshore oil-production platforms (Rostam and Sassan) in the central Persian Gulf in reprisal for the Silkworm missile attack on U.S.-flag tanker Sea Isle City three days earlier. The platforms were set ablaze and collapsed; Navy SEALs subsequently boarded an adjacent, abandoned platform and destroyed radar and communications gear (Los Angeles Times, 19 Oct 1987).  
   • Immediate Iranian response: Tehran acknowledged the strike and vowed a “crushing response,” but no large-scale retaliation followed beyond continued harassment of Gulf shipping.  
   • Immediate U.S. message: President Reagan called the bombardment a “prudent yet restrained response” intended to re-establish freedom of navigation (LA Times, 19 Oct 1987).

2. 18 April 1988 – Operation Praying Mantis  
   • Action: After the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts was mined, three U.S. surface-action groups, backed by carrier aircraft and Marines, destroyed the Iranian Sassan and Sirri platform complexes (now military outposts), sank or disabled several Iranian warships (frigate Sahand, patrol boat Joshan, and others), and badly damaged frigate Sabalan (We Are The Mighty, 5 Jun 2023; ASIL case note).  
   • Immediate Iranian response: Iranian small-boat attacks briefly continued but Tehran avoided further fleet engagement; within three months Iran accepted a U.N-brokered cease-fire with Iraq.  
   • Immediate U.S. message: Washington announced that the operation had “restored freedom of navigation” and warned Iran against any renewed mining or attacks on neutral shipping (We Are The Mighty).

3. 3 July 1988 – Shoot-down of Iran Air Flight 655  
   • Action: While engaged with Iranian gunboats inside Iranian territorial waters near the Strait of Hormuz, cruiser USS Vincennes mistakenly fired two Standard missiles at a civilian Airbus A-300 climbing out of Bandar Abbas, killing all 290 people aboard (CNN, 10 Jan 2020; ICJ case summary).  
   • Immediate Iranian response: Foreign Minister Velayati denounced the “massacre” at the U.N. Security Council; Iran later filed suit at the International Court of Justice. No direct military reprisal followed.  
   • Immediate U.S. message: Vice-President George H. W. Bush defended the crew’s actions as self-defense; a Pentagon inquiry termed the incident “a tragic and regrettable accident.” In 1996 Washington paid US$131.8 million in compensation but issued no formal apology (ADST oral histories).

4. 22 June 2025 – Operation Midnight Hammer (U.S. entry into the 12-Day Iran-Israel War)  
   • Action: Seven B-2 bombers delivered Massive Ordnance Penetrators against the Fordow and Natanz enrichment sites while a U.S. submarine launched Tomahawk missiles at the Isfahan conversion facility (Fanack, 24 Jun 2025; USA Today, 23 Jun 2025).  
   • Immediate Iranian response: Roughly six ballistic missiles were fired at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar; only one reached the perimeter and caused no casualties (Fanack; Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026).  
   • Immediate U.S. message: CENTCOM quietly repositioned air assets; President Trump characterised the strike as “limited and preventive,” claimed severe structural damage to all three sites, and the next day announced a U.S./Qatari-brokered phased cease-fire (Fanack).

Assessment of post-war strike planning (Nov 2025 – Feb 2026)

Force movements and posture  
• Carrier Strike Group: CENTCOM confirmed the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln and escorts entered the Arabian Sea in mid-January 2026 “to promote regional security,” the same hull that supported Midnight Hammer (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026).  
• Air-power drills: U.S. Air Forces Central conducted multi-day “rapid readiness” exercises across the Gulf (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026).  
• Patriot redeployments: The Patriot battalion flown to Qatar before Midnight Hammer rotated home in Oct 2025 and has not yet been back-filled, leaving Al-Udeid more exposed (Middle East Institute, 15 Jan 2026).

Statements by U.S. leaders  
• President Trump has warned that if the regime “massacres protesters,” any response would make June’s attack “look like peanuts,” and has confirmed that “a massive fleet” is moving “just in case” (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026; Guardian, 2 Feb 2026).  
• In a Fox News interview he hinted at an emerging deal but would not rule out strikes (Guardian, 2 Feb 2026).

Media & think-tank reporting on options  
• Pentagon briefings leaked to CNBC list a menu from cyber-ops to limited kinetic strikes on “regime security assets” or fresh attacks on remaining nuclear infrastructure (CNBC, 12 Jan 2026; Politico cited therein).  
• Chicago Council analysts argue that Iran’s internal turmoil reduces its willingness to escalate, making a calibrated U.S. strike less risky (GlobalAffairs blog, 14 Jan 2026).  
• BBC analysis (30 Jan 2026) and Foreign Affairs (15 Jan 2026) counter that deeper Iranian fragility could instead make retaliation less predictable.  
• Middle East Institute notes that the U.S. now has fewer air-defense units in theatre and no second carrier, limiting the scale and sustainability of any new campaign (MEI, 15 Jan 2026).  
• The Conversation (30 Jan 2026) and CFR (13 Jan 2026) warn that renewed strikes could accelerate regional nuclear proliferation and undermine the IAEA inspection regime.

Iranian reactions and deterrent signalling  
• Tehran has pledged that “any attack … will be a regional war,” threatening missile fire against U.S. bases and Israel (Guardian, 2 Feb 2026).  
• State TV has showcased live-fire drills in the Strait of Hormuz; IRGC commanders claim “full defensive readiness” (Al Jazeera live-blog, 30 Jan 2026).  
• Senior adviser Mehdi Mohammadi told state TV that U.S. demands amount to “disarming yourself so we could strike you when we want” (The Conversation, 30 Jan 2026).

Synthesis: pattern of U.S.–Iran action-reaction  
Across all four confirmed kinetic episodes, immediate Iranian retaliation has been limited and largely symbolic: threats in 1987; tactical disengagement in 1988; diplomatic/legal action after Flight 655; and a single, mostly ineffective missile volley in 2025. U.S. messages each time have framed the strikes as proportional, freedom-of-navigation or non-proliferation enforcement, while simultaneously signalling readiness for escalation. The current (Feb 2026) environment differs because:  
• Iran’s domestic unrest is far deeper than in earlier crises;  
• U.S. forward air-defence density is lower than before Midnight Hammer;  
• Public statements by President Trump have tied further U.S. action to human-rights triggers, not purely military provocations, broadening the potential casus belli.  

Remaining information gaps  
1. Precise geographic status of the 1987 Rostam/Sassan platforms (inside or outside the 12-nautical-mile territorial sea) is unclear in open reporting, making their inclusion borderline for a “territorial waters” requirement.  
2. No contemporary open-source casualty or damage figures are available for Iran’s 1987 and 1988 platform losses beyond general descriptions of destruction.  
3. Authoritative Iranian casualty data, damage assessments and radiological-hazard claims from the June 2025 strikes remain sparse.  
4. Classified U.S. rules of engagement, target lists and any presidential findings authorising new strikes (late 2025/early 2026) have not leaked.

Conclusion  
Open-source evidence supports only four confirmed instances since the 1979 revolution in which U.S. uniformed forces carried out overt kinetic strikes on, over, or (arguably) within Iranian sovereign territory or territorial waters: Operation Nimble Archer (Oct 1987), Operation Praying Mantis (Apr 1988), the Flight 655 shoot-down (Jul 1988), and Operation Midnight Hammer (Jun 2025). Each prompted restrained, delayed or primarily diplomatic Iranian reactions, while Washington consistently couched the actions as limited, defensive and deterrent. From November 2025 to February 2026 credible reporting shows the United States redeploying key naval assets, rehearsing air strikes and circulating options ranging from cyber-intrusions to renewed bunker-buster raids. President Trump’s public threats, combined with Iran’s domestic upheaval and reduced U.S. regional air-defence posture, make a fresh clash plausible but not inevitable; both sides appear to be signalling strength while still holding open diplomatic off-ramps.
