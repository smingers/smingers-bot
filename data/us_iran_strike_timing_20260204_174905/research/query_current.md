Analysis:
The key is to monitor any credible reporting that signals concrete U-S military preparations or attempted kinetic action against targets inside Iran. Useful signals include: 1) Pentagon or CENTCOM force deployments to the Gulf, 2) public or leaked discussions of operational planning, 3) strike-related authorisations from the White House, 4) confirmed or alleged explosions/airstrikes on Iranian soil linked to U-S assets, and 5) escalation dynamics with Israel that could draw direct U-S involvement. The most relevant articles will therefore come from defence correspondents, Gulf-region bureaus, and outlets with good military sourcing, published in the last few weeks. We want broad web coverage, dedicated news-only coverage, and an AskNews sweep focusing on very recent or imminent actions.
