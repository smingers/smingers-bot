You are currently doing research for current information/news articles on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
When will the US' national military forces attempt to execute a military strike within the territory, airspace, or territorial waters of Iran?

Question background:
The US struck at least three Iranian nuclear facilities in late June 2025,
and Israel is reportedly considering new strikes on the Islamic Republic.

Sources:
- abcnews.go.com/International/iran-full-scale-war-us-israel-europe-president/

- www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/5/trumps-abduction-of-maduro-escalates-concerns


The options are:
['Before 11 May 2026', 'Between 11 May 2026 and 9 September 2026', 'Between 10 September 2026 and 9 January 2027', 'Not before 9 January 2027']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
The geographic origin of and weaponry used in a military strike will be
immaterial so long as either the weapon detonates or discharges on or over
Iranian territory. A cyberattack alone will not count.

For the purposes of this question, US national military forces exclude US
intelligence services (e.g., CIA).

Public acknowledgment is not required, and the default evidentiary standard
would be used, that being credible, open-source media reporting.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used to find current information/news articles relevant to the question. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news, or AskNews to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search. Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
2. One query for google news?
3. One query for AskNews?
4. All queries followed by either (Google), (Google News) or (AskNews) in brackets () on the same line as the query?
