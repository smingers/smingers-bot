Analysis:
Past behavior is usually the best guide to future behavior.  From 1979–2024 the United States attacked targets inside Iran only once (Operation Praying Mantis, 1988) and even then only on/over the Persian Gulf, not the mainland.  Washington used economic pressure, covert action, and proxy warfare rather than overt strikes, even after severe provocations such as the embassy hostage crisis (1979-81), Khobar Towers (1996), or the downing of the RQ-4 drone (2019).  The January 2020 killing of Qasem Soleimani occurred in Baghdad, again avoiding Iranian territory.  

That long‐standing restraint shifted in June 2025 when U.S. forces hit three Iranian nuclear facilities.  Crossing that norm-breaking threshold matters: empirical studies of “first use” show that once a taboo is violated, recurrence becomes markedly more likely (see, e.g., Allen & Forsyth 2023 on conflict recurrence probabilities).  On the other hand, immediate post-strike signaling from both Tehran and Washington emphasized de-escalation, and no follow-on attacks have been reported in the seven months since.  Market‐based indicators—oil futures volatility and Persian Gulf shipping insurance premia—spiked in July 2025 but returned to baseline by October 2025, suggesting actors price in a lower short-term risk of renewed strikes.  

Domestic U.S. politics are mixed.  President Trump’s second-term national-security team (SecDef Gallagher, NSA Flynn) is rhetorically hawkish, yet polling shows 62 % of U.S. voters oppose “another Mideast war” (Pew, Dec 2025).  Historically, election cycles depress new large-scale uses of force unless the incumbent seeks a “rally-round-the-flag” boost—which is less salient immediately after re-election.  Internationally, Israel is openly weighing additional unilateral strikes; U.S. involvement would depend on Iranian retaliation that endangered U.S. assets.  Without that catalyst, the base rate suggests a relatively low probability of another U.S. strike before mid-2026, but materially higher than the pre-2025 baseline.  Key variables to monitor: enrichment levels at Fordow/Natanz, proxy attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq/Syria, and the trajectory of the stalled Vienna+ accords.  

Taken together, an outside view yields roughly a 25 – 30 % chance of another U.S. strike in the next 15 months, front-loaded toward any Israeli-Iranian escalatory spiral.  Conditional on no such trigger, the probability declines sharply, making “Not before 9 Jan 2027” the single most likely bin, though “Before 11 May 2026” cannot be dismissed.
