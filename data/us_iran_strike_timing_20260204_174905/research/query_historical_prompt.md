You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
When will the US' national military forces attempt to execute a military strike within the territory, airspace, or territorial waters of Iran?

The options are:
['Before 11 May 2026', 'Between 11 May 2026 and 9 September 2026', 'Between 10 September 2026 and 9 January 2027', 'Not before 9 January 2027']

Question background:
The US struck at least three Iranian nuclear facilities in late June 2025,
and Israel is reportedly considering new strikes on the Islamic Republic.

Sources:
- abcnews.go.com/International/iran-full-scale-war-us-israel-europe-president/
- www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/netanyahu-plans-brief-trump-possible-new
- www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/5/trumps-abduction-of-maduro-escalates-concerns


This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
The geographic origin of and weaponry used in a military strike will be
immaterial so long as either the weapon detonates or discharges on or over
Iranian territory. A cyberattack alone will not count.

For the purposes of this question, US national military forces exclude US
intelligence services (e.g., CIA).

Public acknowledgment is not required, and the default evidentiary standard
would be used, that being credible, open-source media reporting.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-04. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-04 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most four sentences.

For Google Trends:
If the question is about Google Trends data for a specific search term, use this source to retrieve actual historical data and base rate statistics. Your query should be the search term itself (e.g., "hospital" or "luigi mangione"). This will return 90-day historical data with computed statistics about typical volatility, which is critical for establishing base rates.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent. Add a Google Trends query if the question involves Google Trends data.
