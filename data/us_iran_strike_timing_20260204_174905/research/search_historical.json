Iran provided advance warning; most missiles were intercepted; no casualties reported.\n   - **January 3, 2020:** US assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani near Baghdad airport\n   - **January 2020 (5 days later):** Iran retaliated by firing missiles at US Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq with advance warning. No US personnel killed, but dozens later reported traumatic brain injuries.\n\n3. **Domestic Unrest in Iran:**\n   - Protests erupted in late December 2025 and early January 2026\n   - Human rights organizations and medical workers report several thousand people killed, with many more injured or detained (exact numbers cannot be verified)\n   - Internet blackout has continued for more than two weeks\n   - On January 8-9, 2026, security forces reportedly lost control of parts of several towns and neighborhoods in major cities before reasserting authority\n   - Protests have diminished but not ended\n\n4. **Iranian Official Statements:**\n   - Iranian authorities deny responsibility for deaths, blaming \"terrorist groups\" and accusing Israel of fomenting unrest\n   - Iran's secretary of the Supreme National Security Council framed protests as a continuation of \"last summer's 12-day war with Israel\"\n   - Senior commanders in Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, regular armed forces, and political officials have warned that any US attack would be treated as an act of war\n\n5. **US Statements:**\n   - President Trump warned Iranian authorities against using violence against protesters\n   - Trump told Iranians \"help is coming\" at the height of the unrest\n\n## Analysis from the Article (attributed to BBC):\n\n- **Changed Context:** Iran's current situation differs markedly from previous confrontations due to severe internal strain from domestic protests\n- **Historical Pattern:** Tehran previously showed preference for delayed and limited retaliation, attempting to signal resolve while avoiding wider war\n- **Current Risk Assessment:** Any US attack now carries significantly higher risk of rapid escalation, both regionally and inside Iran\n- **Potential Scenarios:**\n  - Limited US strike could provide Iranian authorities pretext for further internal repression\n  - Broader US campaign that weakens Iranian state could push country toward chaos and prolonged instability\n- **Regional Risk:** A rapid Iranian response would place Gulf states hosting US forces and Israel at immediate risk\n- **Strategic Constraints:** Trump aware Iran is militarily weaker than before last summer's 12-day war; Tehran aware Trump has little appetite for full-scale, open-ended conflict\n- **Changed Response Pattern:** Iran's previous model of delayed, symbolic retaliation may no longer be sufficient if leaders believe speed is essential to reassert deterrence and internal control\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/31/iranian-official-says-progress-made-on-talks-as-us-iran-tensions-persist\">\n# Summary of Article: \"US, Iran signal talks to avert military conflict amid tensions in the Gulf\"\n\n**Source:** Al Jazeera  \n**Date Context:** Article describes current/recent events (Saturday statements referenced)\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Confirmed Communications:**\n- Both Iran and the US have confirmed opening lines of communication to work out a deal and avoid military action\n- President Trump stated Iran is \"seriously talking\" with Washington\n- Ali Larijani (head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council) said \"the formation of a framework for negotiations is progressing\"\n\n**Military Posture:**\n- US \"armada\" led by USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is heading towards Iran\n- Trump referenced \"very big, powerful ships heading in that direction\"\n- Earlier in the week, Trump said US vessels were ready to use \"violence, if necessary\" if Iran refused talks on its nuclear program\n- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) plans to hold a two-day naval exercise in the Strait of Hormuz\n\n**US Military Warning:**\n- US Central Command (CENTCOM) warned the IRGC on Friday about the planned naval exercises\n- CENTCOM stated: \"Any unsafe and unprofessional behavior near US forces, regional partners or commercial vessels increases risks of collision, escalation, and destabilization\"\n\n**Iranian Position:**\n- Senior Iranian leaders are open to negotiations but only after Trump stops threatening to attack\n- Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi criticized US military presence off Iran's shores, calling it contradictory for the US to request \"professionalism\" from an organization it designated as \"terrorist\"\n- Araghchi stated: \"The presence of outside forces in our region has always caused the exact opposite of what is declared: promoting escalation instead of de-escalation\"\n\n**Regional Diplomatic Efforts:**\n- Qatar: Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani met Larijani in Tehran on Saturday to discuss de-escalation efforts\n- Saudi Arabia: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday that Riyadh would not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran\n- Turkey, UAE, and Saudi Arabia are engaging in diplomatic efforts to prevent military confrontation\n- Turkey (NATO member sharing border with Iran) opposes foreign intervention and has called for US-Iran dialogue\n\n**Situational Assessment:**\n- Al Jazeera's Tohid Asadi described the situation as \"quite fragile and delicate\" but noted Larijani's statement as a \"positive\" sign\n- Tensions have been rising for weeks over Trump's threats related to Iran's crackdown on antigovernment protests and its nuclear program\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/international/u-s-bows-down-to-irans-big-demand-after-drone-action-military-strike-aborted-nuke-deal-next/videoshow/127905144.cms\">\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted content appears to be incomplete or mismatched with the article headline. The headline references \"U.S. Bows Down To Iran's Big Demand After Drone Action; Military Strike Aborted, Nuke Deal Next?\" but the provided article content discusses Pakistan's exclusion from a Global Minerals Conference and an India-US trade deal. There is no content about Iran, military strikes, drone actions, or nuclear deals in the extracted text.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe article content as provided contains no information relevant to the forecasting question about US military strikes on Iran. Instead, it covers two unrelated topics:\n\n1. **Pakistan and Global Minerals Conference:** Former Pakistani envoy Abdul Basit noted that Pakistan was not invited to the Global Minerals Conference despite previously showcasing rare earth minerals to President Trump. India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will attend the Critical Minerals Ministerial in the US. The article suggests this reflects India's stronger policy approach to supply chain resilience and long-term partnerships, while Pakistan faces a strategic setback.\n\n2. **India-US Trade Deal:** Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal defended the India-US trade deal in Parliament, claiming it protects India's agriculture and dairy sectors while providing tariff advantages for Indian exporters. He stated the deal will boost labor-intensive sectors, MSMEs, and opportunities for Indian professionals in the US, while facing political scrutiny from the opposition.\n\n**No facts, statistics, or opinions relevant to the Iran military strike question were found in the provided content.**\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-885047\">\n# Summary of Jerusalem Post Article (January 30, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**US Military Movements:**\n- A new US naval destroyer (USS Delbert D.

Then assess any credible reporting (Nov 2025\u2013Feb 2026) about new strike planning.\nChronology of U.S. kinetic action against Iran, 1979-June 2025  \n(Only episodes for which contemporaneous, open-source evidence is available in the supplied search results.)\n\n1. 19 October 1987 \u2013 Operation Nimble Archer  \n   \u2022 Action: Four U.S. destroyers fired more than 1,000 5-inch rounds at two Iranian offshore oil-production platforms (Rostam and Sassan) in the central Persian Gulf in reprisal for the Silkworm missile attack on U.S.-flag tanker Sea Isle City three days earlier. The platforms were set ablaze and collapsed; Navy SEALs subsequently boarded an adjacent, abandoned platform and destroyed radar and communications gear (Los Angeles Times, 19 Oct 1987).  \n   \u2022 Immediate Iranian response: Tehran acknowledged the strike and vowed a \u201ccrushing response,\u201d but no large-scale retaliation followed beyond continued harassment of Gulf shipping.  \n   \u2022 Immediate U.S. message: President Reagan called the bombardment a \u201cprudent yet restrained response\u201d intended to re-establish freedom of navigation (LA Times, 19 Oct 1987).\n\n2. 18 April 1988 \u2013 Operation Praying Mantis  \n   \u2022 Action: After the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts was mined, three U.S. surface-action groups, backed by carrier aircraft and Marines, destroyed the Iranian Sassan and Sirri platform complexes (now military outposts), sank or disabled several Iranian warships (frigate Sahand, patrol boat Joshan, and others), and badly damaged frigate Sabalan (We Are The Mighty, 5 Jun 2023; ASIL case note).  \n   \u2022 Immediate Iranian response: Iranian small-boat attacks briefly continued but Tehran avoided further fleet engagement; within three months Iran accepted a U.N-brokered cease-fire with Iraq.  \n   \u2022 Immediate U.S. message: Washington announced that the operation had \u201crestored freedom of navigation\u201d and warned Iran against any renewed mining or attacks on neutral shipping (We Are The Mighty).\n\n3. 3 July 1988 \u2013 Shoot-down of Iran Air Flight 655  \n   \u2022 Action: While engaged with Iranian gunboats inside Iranian territorial waters near the Strait of Hormuz, cruiser USS Vincennes mistakenly fired two Standard missiles at a civilian Airbus A-300 climbing out of Bandar Abbas, killing all 290 people aboard (CNN, 10 Jan 2020; ICJ case summary).  \n   \u2022 Immediate Iranian response: Foreign Minister Velayati denounced the \u201cmassacre\u201d at the U.N. Security Council; Iran later filed suit at the International Court of Justice. No direct military reprisal followed.  \n   \u2022 Immediate U.S. message: Vice-President George H. W. Bush defended the crew\u2019s actions as self-defense; a Pentagon inquiry termed the incident \u201ca tragic and regrettable accident.\u201d In 1996 Washington paid US$131.8 million in compensation but issued no formal apology (ADST oral histories).\n\n4. 22 June 2025 \u2013 Operation Midnight Hammer (U.S. entry into the 12-Day Iran-Israel War)  \n   \u2022 Action: Seven B-2 bombers delivered Massive Ordnance Penetrators against the Fordow and Natanz enrichment sites while a U.S. submarine launched Tomahawk missiles at the Isfahan conversion facility (Fanack, 24 Jun 2025; USA Today, 23 Jun 2025).  \n   \u2022 Immediate Iranian response: Roughly six ballistic missiles were fired at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar; only one reached the perimeter and caused no casualties (Fanack; Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022 Immediate U.S. message: CENTCOM quietly repositioned air assets; President Trump characterised the strike as \u201climited and preventive,\u201d claimed severe structural damage to all three sites, and the next day announced a U.S./Qatari-brokered phased cease-fire (Fanack).\n\nAssessment of post-war strike planning (Nov 2025 \u2013 Feb 2026)\n\nForce movements and posture  \n\u2022 Carrier Strike Group: CENTCOM confirmed the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln and escorts entered the Arabian Sea in mid-January 2026 \u201cto promote regional security,\u201d the same hull that supported Midnight Hammer (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Air-power drills: U.S. Air Forces Central conducted multi-day \u201crapid readiness\u201d exercises across the Gulf (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Patriot redeployments: The Patriot battalion flown to Qatar before Midnight Hammer rotated home in Oct 2025 and has not yet been back-filled, leaving Al-Udeid more exposed (Middle East Institute, 15 Jan 2026).\n\nStatements by U.S. leaders  \n\u2022 President Trump has warned that if the regime \u201cmassacres protesters,\u201d any response would make June\u2019s attack \u201clook like peanuts,\u201d and has confirmed that \u201ca massive fleet\u201d is moving \u201cjust in case\u201d (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026; Guardian, 2 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 In a Fox News interview he hinted at an emerging deal but would not rule out strikes (Guardian, 2 Feb 2026).\n\nMedia & think-tank reporting on options  \n\u2022 Pentagon briefings leaked to CNBC list a menu from cyber-ops to limited kinetic strikes on \u201cregime security assets\u201d or fresh attacks on remaining nuclear infrastructure (CNBC, 12 Jan 2026; Politico cited therein).  \n\u2022 Chicago Council analysts argue that Iran\u2019s internal turmoil reduces its willingness to escalate, making a calibrated U.S. strike less risky (GlobalAffairs blog, 14 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 BBC analysis (30 Jan 2026) and Foreign Affairs (15 Jan 2026) counter that deeper Iranian fragility could instead make retaliation less predictable.  \n\u2022 Middle East Institute notes that the U.S. now has fewer air-defense units in theatre and no second carrier, limiting the scale and sustainability of any new campaign (MEI, 15 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 The Conversation (30 Jan 2026) and CFR (13 Jan 2026) warn that renewed strikes could accelerate regional nuclear proliferation and undermine the IAEA inspection regime.\n\nIranian reactions and deterrent signalling  \n\u2022 Tehran has pledged that \u201cany attack \u2026 will be a regional war,\u201d threatening missile fire against U.S. bases and Israel (Guardian, 2 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 State TV has showcased live-fire drills in the Strait of Hormuz; IRGC commanders claim \u201cfull defensive readiness\u201d (Al Jazeera live-blog, 30 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Senior adviser Mehdi Mohammadi told state TV that U.S. demands amount to \u201cdisarming yourself so we could strike you when we want\u201d (The Conversation, 30 Jan 2026).\n\nSynthesis: pattern of U.S.\u2013Iran action-reaction  \nAcross all four confirmed kinetic episodes, immediate Iranian retaliation has been limited and largely symbolic: threats in 1987; tactical disengagement in 1988; diplomatic/legal action after Flight 655; and a single, mostly ineffective missile volley in 2025. U.S. messages each time have framed the strikes as proportional, freedom-of-navigation or non-proliferation enforcement, while simultaneously signalling readiness for escalation. The current (Feb 2026) environment differs because:  \n\u2022 Iran\u2019s domestic unrest is far deeper than in earlier crises;  \n\u2022 U.S. forward air-defence density is lower than before Midnight Hammer;  \n\u2022 Public statements by President Trump have tied further U.S. action to human-rights triggers, not purely military provocations, broadening the potential casus belli.  \n\nRemaining information gaps  \n1. Precise geographic status of the 1987 Rostam/Sassan platforms (inside or outside the 12-nautical-mile territorial sea) is unclear in open reporting, making their inclusion borderline for a \u201cterritorial waters\u201d requirement.  \n2. No contemporary open-source casualty or damage figures are available for Iran\u2019s 1987 and 1988 platform losses beyond general descriptions of destruction.  \n3. Authoritative Iranian casualty data, damage assessments and radiological-hazard claims from the June 2025 strikes remain sparse.  \n4. Classified U.S. rules of engagement, target lists and any presidential findings authorising new strikes (late 2025/early 2026) have not leaked.\n\nConclusion  \nOpen-source evidence supports only four confirmed instances since the 1979 revolution in which U.S. uniformed forces carried out overt kinetic strikes on, over, or (arguably) within Iranian sovereign territory or territorial waters: Operation Nimble Archer (Oct 1987), Operation Praying Mantis (Apr 1988), the Flight 655 shoot-down (Jul 1988), and Operation Midnight Hammer (Jun 2025). Each prompted restrained, delayed or primarily diplomatic Iranian reactions, while Washington consistently couched the actions as limited, defensive and deterrent. From November 2025 to February 2026 credible reporting shows the United States redeploying key naval assets, rehearsing air strikes and circulating options ranging from cyber-intrusions to renewed bunker-buster raids. President Trump\u2019s public threats, combined with Iran\u2019s domestic upheaval and reduced U.S. regional air-defence posture, make a fresh clash plausible but not inevitable; both sides appear to be signalling strength while still holding open diplomatic off-ramps.  \n\nNo additional targeted searches are judged necessary to fulfil the query; the principal factual record and current reporting have been covered by the sources cited above.</Agent_report>\n"
