## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent report timeline hallucination | Medium | Research (historical Agent query) | Agent report claims "GPT-5 first clear: early February 2025" but MARCA article (Aug 2025) and internal timeline indicate GPT-5 completed in August 2025, not February 2025. Also claims "Manifold market resolving 5 Feb 2026 confirms public launch of Opus 4.5" — Manifold markets resolve when questions close, not model launches; Opus 4.5 was live by at least Jan 13 per TIME article. |
| F5 inside view made zero update | Medium | S2-5 | o3 forecaster 5 produced an inside view with distribution **identical** to its outside view — no update at all from current news. The inside view is a mechanical restatement of the outside view with no evidence integration. |
| Research gap: no Feb 2026 stream status | Medium | Research (current queries) | No source confirmed the actual in-game state as of forecast date (Feb 26). All current searches returned Jan 23-29 articles at best. The supervisor research closed this partially but still only confirmed "no finish" — not current location or reset status. |
| AI Village article misapplied by F1 | Low | S1-1 | F1 cites "Claude Opus 4.1 tends to declare premature victory" (AI Village experiment) as a relevant behavioral prior, but that experiment is entirely distinct from the Claude Plays Pokémon harness and provides no reliable signal about this stream. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical only) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (Wikipedia TPP article) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. `Claude Plays Pokemon progress timeline` (Google) — game wiki/blog progress tracking
2. `Twitch Plays Pokemon completion times` (Google) — TPP base-rate anchor
3. `AI completed Pokemon Red date` (Google) — autonomous AI completions base rate
4. `Claude Plays Pokemon GitHub commits` (Google) — developer velocity signal
5. `autonomous agents beat retro games` (Google) — broader AI completion reference class
6. `List documented cases since 2010 of autonomous AI agents completing Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow...` (Agent) — synthesized table with demo-to-clear lags
7. `Claude Plays Pokemon February 2026 update` (Google News) — current progress

**Current Queries** (tools: Google News, AskNews):
8. `Claude Plays Pokemon February 2026 update` (Google News) — recent news
9. `Anthropic Claude update January 2026` (Google News) — model capability changes
10. `Reports on Claude Plays Pokemon stream hiatus, technical issues, or resets during 2026` (AskNews) — contrarian indicators

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Pre-Feb-2026 completion records, GPT/Gemini benchmarks, developer activity | Feb 2026 news, recent model releases, stream setbacks |
| Content type | Base rates, comparison AIs, code repos, run timelines | Stream status, model upgrades, technical disruptions |
| Tools used | Google + Agent (strong for synthesis) | Google News + AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Agent report synthesizing every documented autonomous Gen-1 clear | Surfaced Claude API outages Feb 24-25; confirmed no finish by late Jan |

**Analysis:**

The query plan (generated by the new iterative planner using o3 as `query_generator`) is analytically strong. The planning reasoning explicitly identified five "key missing pieces" and correctly split 60% historical / 40% current. The queries are discrete with minimal overlap. Compared to the Feb 1 run of the same question — which used a simpler query set without explicit gap analysis or tool assignments — this represents a clear improvement in research structure.

Historical queries targeted base rate establishment effectively: the Agent query produced a useful table of all four documented AI completions (GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini, RL project). Google queries surfaced the LessWrong Jan 29 post, TIME Jan 13 article, and Manifold Markets page — the three most informative sources available.

Current queries had a fundamental limitation: no source from Feb 2026 confirmed the stream's actual state. The Google News query for "February 2026 update" returned only Jan 23-29 articles. The AskNews query for "hiatus, technical issues, or resets" found only the Claude API outage (Feb 24-25) — no stream-specific update. This is a genuine data gap, not a query design failure; the information simply did not exist publicly.

Query 4 (`GitHub commits`) was only weakly informative — the scraped repos are community tools rather than the official stream, providing no velocity signal.

The Agent query on AI completions is the standout contribution of the new research approach. It produced a well-structured base-rate table and identified demo-to-clear lags (1–5 weeks for LLM agents). However, the agent introduced a **timeline error**: it placed GPT-5's first clear in "early February 2025" when the MARCA article (Aug 18, 2025) and other sources clearly show GPT-5's completion was much later.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report and article summaries are appropriately factual — no probability estimates embedded in source materials. The Agent report concludes with information gaps listed rather than speculative probability language. This is correct behavior.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** Jan 29 LessWrong post (Claude at Victory Road, ~230k steps, 8 badges, reset imminent); TIME Jan 13 (500+ hours, frequently stuck); Manifold Markets (second run reset before step 200k, third run with "Claude 4"); GPT/Gemini completion benchmarks with timelines; Claude API outage Feb 24-25.
- **Critical information missed:** Current in-game state as of Feb 26 (still at Victory Road? Reset?); whether the "Claude 4" third run referenced in Manifold had actually started; any February 2026 stream update post Jan 29.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - *Google/Google News:* Excellent. Surfaced the most important sources consistently across historical and current phases.
  - *Agent report:* Good synthesis of AI completion history; one significant timeline error on GPT-5 completion date.
  - *AskNews:* Mostly irrelevant results — found Pokemon 30th anniversary news and Claude API outage, but no stream-specific 2026 updates. The AskNews query intent (stream hiatuses/resets in 2026) was not satisfied.
  - *Question URL scraping:* The Wikipedia TPP article was correctly summarized as background-only.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

The outside view prompt provided all sources as `historical context`. All five forecasters had access to the same research.

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

---

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Explicitly evaluates 8 sources with quality assessments (High/Moderate/Low). Correctly identifies LessWrong Jan 29 as highest signal, dismisses AI Village as low direct relevance, flags Saanya Ojha claim as "appears to be a different setup." Correctly notes "GitHub repos: technical background, no progress info." Good but slightly dismisses the Saanya Ojha note without fully explaining the different-setup reasoning.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes: (RC1) LLM agents completing Pokémon from near-end, (RC2) Claude's historical sticking points, (RC3) Model resets. Selects a blend of RC1+RC2 with justification. Reasonably argued though RC3 (resets) deserved more systematic treatment as a structural feature.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 7 months remaining, correctly notes Jan 29 source shows Claude was still stuck, correctly frames the scenario split (no reset vs. reset). Discusses historical patterns from reference class (GPT-o3 15 days, GPT-5 7 days, Gemini ~48-55 hours).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Scenario A (no reset, 30-40%) → Feb-Mar completion; Scenario B (reset, 60-70%) → Mar-Jun; gives probabilistic logic but no formal calculation. Acknowledges 15-20% non-resolution by Oct 1.

**Outside view central estimate:** Median ~Apr-May 2026 (from stated percentiles: P40=Apr-10, P60=May-15)

**Strengths:** Clear source triage, scenario framing. **Weaknesses:** Optimistic — places P10 at Feb-28, implying ~10% chance the game was already complete by forecast date. This is aggressive given that no Feb-26 source confirmed completion. The AI Village citation is noise.

**Score:** 13/16 (SA:3, RCS:3, TA:4, BRD:3)

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough — 7 sources evaluated with quality ratings. Correctly identifies the Manifold Markets source as confirming "second run reset, third run with Claude 4." Identifies Claude API outages Feb 24-25 as low-moderate relevance. Notes Saanya Ojha claim is "unverified and likely different setup."
- **Reference Class Selection:** 3 classes identified (RC1: other AI agents from near-end; RC2: Claude's historical sticking pattern; RC3: model resets). Selects "Claude's own pattern + reset possibility" as most suitable. Reasonable.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies ~7 months remaining. Notes previous run took ~11 months to reach Victory Road. Correctly notes a reset would restart at zero but newer models are faster.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 4 explicit scenarios with probabilities (Scenario A: 30%, B: 50%, C: 15%, D: 20%). Notes ~75-80% probability of resolution within window. For the distribution of *when*, gives "central estimate April-June." The scenario probabilities are clear but add to >100% (totaling 115%), suggesting some overlap or loose accounting.

**Outside view central estimate:** Median ~May-Jun 2026 (P40=May-01, P60=Jun-15)

**Strengths:** Scenario analysis with explicit probabilities, strong source evaluation. **Weaknesses:** P10=Feb-20 is before today (Feb 26), which is inappropriate — S1-2 was reasoning as if the outcome could already have happened in the past before the forecast. The probabilities summing to >100% is a minor error.

**Score:** 13/16 (SA:4, RCS:3, TA:3, BRD:3)

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Evaluates 7 sources with quality ratings and explicit "usefulness" assessments. Notes AI Digest experiment "provides only indirect context" and flags it clearly. Identifies the Agent report as "best single place for outside-view reference class, even if some entries are noisy." Explicitly notes Substack estimates have mixed quality.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes with explicit pros/cons analysis: (1) All AI Pokemon completions, (2) Long-running public Twitch AI playthroughs with resets, (3) Time-to-finish conditional on being in endgame. Selects blend of (2) and (3), explicitly rejecting (1) as overpredicting speed. This is the most sophisticated reference class analysis of all five forecasters.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 7 months. Notes Victory Road's boulder puzzles are "exactly the kind of stateful spatial task that produces extremely long loops." Correctly identifies regime uncertainty (resets, stalls, project interruption).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Mixture distribution explicitly stated: "no-reset/benign reset" → 1-4 months; "reset/prolonged failure" → 4-10+ months. Uses wide P10-P90 interval explicitly to reflect "genuine regime uncertainty." Correctly notes open upper bound.

**Outside view central estimate:** Median ~May-Jun 2026 (P40=May-25, P60=Jul-05)

**Strengths:** Best reference class analysis in the ensemble — explicitly evaluating the fit of three alternatives and rejecting the overoptimistic class. Correctly rejects the "fast completion" class as not applicable given harness differences. **Weaknesses:** P10 = Mar-20 is arguably too conservative given the existing run was already at Victory Road; could have acknowledged the ~10-15% chance the game was already complete. Does not give explicit numerical scenario probabilities.

**Score:** 14/16 (SA:4, RCS:4, TA:3, BRD:3)

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Evaluates 6 sources with explicit quality rankings. Correctly identifies the LessWrong eyewitness post and TIME as the highest quality. Notes the Agent report as "synthetic but carefully sourced." Correctly dismisses non-relevant articles.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 candidate classes: "already-in-Victory-Road" (GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini — n=3), "Claude Plays Pokémon previous runs," and "any autonomous Gen-1 project." Selects the narrow "already-in-Victory-Road" class with adjustment for Claude's slower efficiency. Notes GPT-o3 (15 days from starting run) as the closest datapoint. Provides explicit quantitative anchor: "once an uninterrupted finishing attempt begins, median clearance ≈ 15 wall-clock days, 90th ≈ 45 days."
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Identifies pace acceleration per model upgrade. Notes 218 days remaining allows "2-3 further full attempts even if a reset happens in March/April." Provides empirical observation: badges earned accelerated from Oct-25 to Jan-26, implying model improvements.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses formal probabilistic reasoning: no-reset kernel (log-normal μ≈2.7, σ≈0.7), convolve with two-stage geometric reset process (p(reset)≈0.45 by Apr-30, p(second reset)≈0.20 by Aug-01), plus 10% mass beyond Oct 1 mapped to exponential tail. This is by far the most rigorous outside view calculation in the ensemble.

**Outside view central estimate:** Median ~Jun-2026 (P40=Jun-03, P60=Aug-01)

**Strengths:** Most quantitatively rigorous — explicitly convolved distributions with reset processes, used log-normal parameters calibrated to reference class. Correctly assigns substantial mass beyond Oct 1. **Weaknesses:** P90=Mar-01-2027 is extremely conservative; the exponential tail may be too fat given the 7-month window and improving models.

**Score:** 15/16 (SA:4, RCS:4, TA:4, BRD:3)

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Evaluates 5 sources concisely. Correctly dismisses irrelevant sources. Notes Agent report is "high for the historical record it covers."
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 candidate classes and performs the most analytically striking calculation: Claude's "relative speed factor = (actual elapsed since first demo)/(median demo-to-clear) ≈ 365d / 12d ≈ 30× slower." Uses memoryless hazard model to derive 13% base rate by Oct 1, then applies ×3 multiplier for "near Victory Road" and "reset would improve competence" → 40% P(clear by Oct 1). This is explicitly more pessimistic than all other forecasters.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly frames the 217-day window. Notes that halving the window would cut P(finish) by ~10pp and doubling would raise it ~15pp — a rare explicit timeframe sensitivity analysis.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Formal hazard model calculation: instantaneous hazard ~1/45 months (scaled from median agent), cumulative over 7 months → 13% base rate. Then uplift to 40%. Gives percentiles consistent with 40% P(resolution by Oct 1): median ~Jul-18, P80 = Dec-10.

**Outside view central estimate:** Median ~Jun-30 to Jul-18 (P40=Jun-30, P60=Sep-05)

**Strengths:** Most analytically creative — uses hazard model with explicit speed-factor calculation. Correctly identifies that Claude is a statistical outlier among autonomous AI agents. The timeframe sensitivity analysis is unique and valuable. **Weaknesses:** The 30× slowdown factor applied to a memoryless hazard model may overpenalize Claude since it ignores the conditional information that Claude is now in Victory Road (which is structurally different from "starting a run"). The ×3 multiplier for Victory Road position feels underpowered given that all four documented AI agents cleared the game after reaching VR.

**Score:** 15/16 (SA:3, RCS:4, TA:4, BRD:4)

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | P50 Estimate | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | ~Apr-May 2026 | 13/16 | Clear source triage, scenario framing | Optimistic; P10=Feb-28 too aggressive |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | ~May-Jun 2026 | 13/16 | Scenario probabilities, strong source eval | P10=Feb-20 (before today); probs sum >100% |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~Jun 2026 | 14/16 | Best reference class analysis; rejects fast-completion class | No explicit scenario probabilities |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~Jun-Jul 2026 | 15/16 | Formal log-normal + convolution model | P90 = Mar-2027 potentially too fat-tailed |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~Jun-Jul 2026 | 15/16 | Hazard model with explicit speed-factor | Victory Road conditionality underweighted |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | S1 Input Summary |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self-model) | P50≈Apr-May, optimistic, scenario A/B/C |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | P50≈Jun-Jul, formal log-normal model, conservative |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | P50≈May-Jun, scenario breakdown, P10=Feb-20 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | P50≈Jun, best reference class analysis |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | P50≈Jun-Jul, hazard model, 40% by Oct 1 |

---

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong: Jan 29 LessWrong (Victory Road, reset imminent), multiple sources confirming GPT/Gemini feasibility, Manifold confirming third run with "Claude 4." Moderate: Claude 4 capability assumption. Weak: Feb 24-25 outages. Good coverage.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input S1-1 had median ~Apr-May. Output is P40=Apr-15, P50=~May, P90=Sep-10. Minimal update — essentially uses S1-1 unchanged. Explicitly states "my inside view shifts slightly earlier given Claude 4's likely capability improvements" but the stated percentiles are barely different from the outside view. The direction is right (earlier, given capability upgrade) but the magnitude is negligible (~5 days at most).
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** States "If timeframe were halved (~May 1), I'd assign ~50-60% probability." This is addressed concisely but the sensitivity analysis is thin.
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 7 items present and meaningful. Correctly paraphrases target variable, states base rate from S1, checks implied median (Apr 2026), lists top evidence with quality flags, identifies blind spot (game already completed), notes status quo.

**Numeric-specific:** Updates both central estimate and uncertainty range (modestly). P90 extends slightly to Sep-10. Doesn't explicitly discuss tail calibration.

**Score:** 13/16 (EW:4, UBR:2, TS:3, CC:4) — the update-from-base-rate score is penalized because the inside view barely changed from outside view despite new information (Manifold "Claude 4" announcement).

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly weights Jan 29 LessWrong as most current and specific, notes S1-4's conservative outside view as the input anchor.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input S1-4 had P90=Mar-01-2027. Output is P90=Nov-15. This is a substantial leftward pull — Sonnet 4.6 receiving o3's very conservative outside view moderates it significantly. The shift is well-justified: "tighten the early tail slightly (Victory Road confirmed) and keep the late tail similar." The median moved from ~Jun-Jul (S1-4) to ~May-Jun (S2-2). Direction correct, magnitude reasonable.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addressed — "If timeframe halved (~3.5 months): resolution probability drops significantly." States "I shift distribution right substantially" if halved. Good analysis.
- **Calibration Checklist:** All items present. Correctly notes blind spot: "biggest risk is Claude 4 dramatically faster, completing in days."

**Numeric-specific:** Updates both central estimate and tails. P90 shrinks significantly (from Mar-2027 to Nov-15-2026) — Sonnet moderating o3's extreme conservatism. This is a meaningful inside view contribution.

**Score:** 14/16 (EW:3, UBR:4, TS:4, CC:3)

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good Strong/Moderate/Weak structure. Notes S1-2 placed P10=Feb-20 (before today). "Today is 2026-02-26 and there's no provided confirmation of completion yet. That alone forces a right-shift." Correctly identifies the key inside-view update: the absence of a completion confirmation by today.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input S1-2 had P10=Feb-20 (before today). Output is P10=Apr-05 — a 6-week rightward shift of the left tail. Correctly justified. P60 moves from Jun-15 to Aug-05 (seven-week rightward shift). The update direction is correct and the magnitude is sensible given that no completion was reported.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** States "If available time halved (~3.5 months, to mid-June): I'd shift probability mass toward 'no reset' scenario but substantial chance of missing the shortened deadline." Also addresses doubling. Good.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Notes blind spot: "Claude quietly beat the game already (unnoticed here)."

**Numeric-specific:** Updates both central estimate and uncertainty range. Appropriately shifts the entire distribution right. P90 barely changes (Nov-10 vs. S1-2's Nov-20) — maintains a conservative right tail matching input.

**Score:** 14/16 (EW:4, UBR:4, TS:3, CC:3)

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Relatively brief but uses Strong/Moderate/Weak labels. Strong: "multiple independent mainstream sources agree: Opus 4.5 in end-game but not yet victorious." Moderate: history of resets on new model releases, past week-long stalls. Weak: one-day outage.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input S1-3 had P10=Mar-20, P90=Nov-20. Output P10=Mar-28 (small right shift), P90=Dec-01 (small right shift). Very modest update — essentially preserved S1-3's distribution with a slight rightward nudge. Justification: "Resulting mixture: 60% probability of success before July, 40% after." This is a conservative inside-view update that doesn't engage deeply with the current news sources (outage, Manifold's "Claude 4" announcement).
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Mentions halved/doubled windows but analysis is brief: "if halved my median would shift slightly earlier but fat right tail would remain."
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present and complete. Correctly identifies blind spot as "sudden human hot-fix giving Claude perfect pathfinding."

**Numeric-specific:** The update is minimal (~1-2 week shifts). Central estimate and tails essentially unchanged from outside view. o3 receiving GPT-5.2's outside view made little adjustment.

**Score:** 12/16 (EW:3, UBR:3, TS:2, CC:4) — timeframe sensitivity is underdeveloped; the update from S1-3's already reasonable distribution is minimal.

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Standard Strong/Moderate/Weak structure. Lists the correct key sources.
- **Update from Base Rate:** **Critical failure**: The stated percentiles are **identical** to S1-5's outside view:
  - Outside view P10=Mar-19, P40=Jun-30, P60=Sep-05, P80=Dec-10, P90=Jan-15-2027
  - Inside view P10=Mar-19, P40=Jun-30, P60=Sep-05, P80=Dec-10, P90=Jan-15-2027
  
  Despite listing inside-view boosts (+20pp for Victory Road position, +10pp for model upgrades) and dampers (-10pp for reset, -5pp for strategic lapses), the distribution is unchanged. The reasoning says "Net probability of finishing before 1 Oct 2026 ≈ 40%" — same as the outside view's 40%. The inside view simply recycles the outside view with no distributional update.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** States "If halved, cut P(finish) by ~10pp; if doubled, raise by ~15pp." This is present but brief.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Notes blind spot: "Anthropic quietly patches harness allowing Claude to brute-force puzzles overnight."

**Numeric-specific:** No update to any percentile. The inside view is a verbatim copy of the outside view distribution.

**Score:** 9/16 (EW:3, UBR:1, TS:2, CC:3) — the zero-update is a significant failure of the inside view stage.

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | P50 Output | Delta vs S1 Input | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (≈Apr-May) | ~Apr-May | Negligible | 13/16 | Partial |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (≈Jun-Jul) | ~May-Jun | ~1 month earlier | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (≈May-Jun) | ~Jun-Jul | ~1-2 months later | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (≈Jun) | ~Jun | Negligible | 12/16 | Partial |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (≈Jun-Jul) | ~Jun-Jul | Zero | 9/16 | No |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

**Did cross-model instances engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet ← o3):** Most effective cross-model pairing. Sonnet 4.6 received o3's conservative log-normal model and meaningfully moderated it — pulling P90 from Mar-2027 to Nov-15-2026. Explicitly acknowledged the base rate it received and reasoned about the scenarios it would accept vs. reject.
- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← Sonnet):** Effective. GPT-5.2 received Sonnet's outside view and correctly identified the key update (P10=Feb-20 was before today) — pushing the entire distribution rightward as the primary inside-view move. Good engagement with cross-pollinated input.
- **S2-4 (o3 ← GPT-5.2):** Partial. o3 received GPT-5.2's outside view (with its excellent reference class analysis) but made only minimal adjustments, essentially preserving the input distribution. The inside view didn't clearly articulate why the current news changed things.

**Did same-model instances behave differently than cross-model instances?**

- **S2-1 (Sonnet ← Sonnet):** Minimal update from its own outside view. Self-reinforcing, no meaningful diversity added.
- **S2-5 (o3 ← o3):** Zero update. The self-referential loop produced no new information — the instance simply restated the outside view unchanged.

**Cross-pollination effect on diversity:** The S2-2 pairing (Sonnet ← o3) successfully reduced the very fat tail from S1-4 without losing the core conservative structure. S2-3's rightward shift via GPT-5.2 ← Sonnet cross-pollination moved the distribution closer to the ensemble center. Net effect: cross-pollination slightly compressed the ensemble spread compared to what pure self-pollination would have produced. The biggest remaining divergence came from S2-5 (o3 self-loop) which anchored at an unchanged pessimistic distribution.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: Twitch stream, defeating Champion Blue, confirmed by stream/organizer.
- All correctly identified the open upper bound and explicitly placed P90 values beyond Oct 1.
- All correctly identified the forecast window start as Jan 18, 2026 (not today).
- The "date" question type was handled correctly — forecasters output YYYY-MM-DD percentiles and the pipeline converts to unix timestamps.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Claude Opus 4.5 was playing as of Jan 23-29, 2026, with all 8 badges, in Victory Road stuck on boulder puzzles.
2. GPT and Gemini have already beaten the game (with more assistive harnesses); Claude has not.
3. Model resets are a structural feature of the project — prior runs were reset when new Claude models were released.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| All (via Agent report) | GPT-5 timeline | Agent report says "GPT-5 first clear: early February 2025" but MARCA article is dated August 18, 2025; GPT-5's first clear was likely August 2025, not February 2025 | Low — forecasters didn't heavily anchor on GPT-5 timing |
| S2-2, S2-3 | Manifold "Claude 4" interpretation | Some forecasters interpreted "third run with Claude 4" as confirming a reset has already occurred, while this may refer to the planned future reset. The Manifold article says "Reset time! Can Claude 4 do better?" suggesting it was referring to a future reset, not a completed one. | Medium — affected scenario probabilities |
| Supervisor | Opus 4.5 release date | Supervisor states "Manifold market resolving 5 Feb 2026 confirms public launch of Opus 4.5" — but Opus 4.5 was clearly live by Jan 13, 2026 per the TIME article. Manifold market resolution dates don't confirm model launches. | Low — didn't change final prediction |

### Hallucinations

The Agent report (historical query) contains what appears to be a timeline hallucination: it dates GPT-5's first clear to "early February 2025" when multiple other sources indicate it was August 2025. The agent appeared to confuse a Substack article's internal reference frame. This is not an invented source but a misattributed date. Impact was low because forecasters correctly treated this agent report with appropriate skepticism.

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review

### Divergence & Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Divergence metric | rn_spread |
| Divergence value | 0.1379 |
| Trigger threshold | 0.045 |
| Supervisor triggered? | Yes |
| Supervisor model | Claude Opus 4.6 |
| Supervisor confidence | LOW |
| Supervisor cost | $0.44 |

The divergence was 3× above threshold — the largest spread observed in any assessed forecast so far. The trigger was appropriate; the ensemble had a genuine disagreement about completion probability before Oct 1 ranging from ~40% (F5) to ~90% (F1).

### Stage 1: Disagreement Analysis

**Quality of disagreement identification:**

The supervisor correctly identified the three major disagreements:
1. Whether Claude already completed the game before Feb 26 (left tail issue — F1's P10=Feb-28)
2. Probability of completion before Oct 1 (the dominant spread driver — F1: ~90%, F5: ~40%)
3. Whether a reset had already occurred and what model is playing

All three are accurately characterized. The analysis correctly prioritizes Disagreement 2 as "the biggest source of spread" and labels Disagreement 1 as "most impactful for the left tail."

**Root cause classification:**

The supervisor correctly distinguishes:
- Disagreements 1 and 3 as *factual* (verifiable via research)
- Disagreement 2 as *partially factual, partially judgment-based* ("different weighting of the same evidence AND different base rate assumptions")

This is accurate. Disagreement 2 is fundamentally about whether to use F5's hazard-model approach (30× slowdown → 13% → 40% with uplift) vs. F1's scenario approach (~90% by Oct 1). Both are defensible and research cannot resolve which framing is correct.

### Stage 1: Search Query Quality

| # | Query | Source | Targets Which Disagreement? | Redundant with Round 1? |
|---|-------|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | Claude Plays Pokemon current progress 2026 | Google News | D1 and D3 (reset status, current location) | Partial (same intent as query 7, but news-specific) |
| 2 | Claude Plays Pokemon Victory Road Elite Four February 2026 | Google | D1 and D3 (specific location) | Partial (more specific than prior queries) |
| 3 | Current status of the Claude Plays Pokemon Twitch stream — has the run been reset? What model? Has Elite Four been beaten? | Agent | D1, D2, D3 (all) | No — direct question not previously asked |
| 4 | Claude 4 model release date Anthropic 2026 | Google News | D3 (what model is current) | Partial |

Queries are well-targeted at the factual disagreements. Query 3 (Agent) is the most valuable — explicitly asking whether completion has occurred or a reset happened. Queries 1 and 2 are appropriately differentiated (news vs. general web). Query 4 for "Claude 4 model release date" is partially redundant since forecasters already knew about Opus 4.5, but it was appropriate given uncertainty about whether a newer model existed.

No queries attempt to resolve the judgment-based part of Disagreement 2 (which framing is correct), which is appropriate — that's not resolvable via search.

### Stage 2: Supervisor Research Quality

**Novelty vs. redundancy:**

The supervisor research surfaced genuinely new, relevant information:

1. **Agent report confirmed** Claude Opus 4.5 is still active, no reset since switching to Opus 4.5, game NOT completed as of February 2026. This directly resolves Disagreement 1 (ruling out F1's ~15% "already completed" probability) and partially resolves Disagreement 3.

2. **Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6 announcements** — genuinely new information not in Round 1. Opus 4.6 shows "major improvements in navigating large, complex environments" and "sustained autonomous operation." This is directly relevant to reset risk and post-reset capability. New Yorker article (Feb 16, 2026) also confirmed the stream was ongoing.

3. The Ars Technica article (March 2025) added historical context on Claude's failure modes, though this was largely already captured by earlier sources.

**Relevance:** High. The new research directly addressed the factual disagreements and resolved the most resolvable one (whether completion had already occurred).

**Missing:** No source from February 2026 confirmed the exact current in-game state — the supervisor's Agent report concluded the run was "still live" but couldn't confirm whether Claude was still stuck in Victory Road or had made progress since Jan 29.

### Stage 2: Supervisor Reasoning & Reconciliation

**Reasoning quality:**

The supervisor reasoning explicitly addressed each disagreement:
- D1: "RESOLVED — agent research confirms Claude has NOT beaten the game." Correctly rules out F1's early February completion probability.
- D2: "PARTIALLY RESOLVED — discovery of Opus 4.6 provides meaningful capability upgrade path."
- D3: "PARTIALLY RESOLVED — Opus 4.5 confirmed still active, no reset."

The reasoning is logical and sound. The supervisor correctly notes that "the core disagreement is about how to weight" evidence — recognizing it cannot be fully resolved.

**Reconciliation approach:**

The supervisor maintained essentially the ensemble weighted average distribution (the submitted CDF matches the aggregation). The supervisor's stated percentiles from the reasoning are:
- P10: Mar-21, P20: Apr-22, P40: Jun-04, P60: Jul-20, P80: Sep-15, P90: Nov-25

These are nearly identical to the ensemble average. The supervisor made one directional adjustment: ruling out F1's early February completion probability (shifting P10 from Feb-28 to Mar-21), which was the correct update given the research confirmed no completion. But the core of the distribution is unchanged.

The LOW confidence rating is appropriate — the supervisor correctly assessed that the main disagreement (judgment about completion probability) cannot be resolved by research. This is honest and calibrated. A supervisor that claimed HIGH confidence while keeping the ensemble average would have been worse.

**Was the adjustment an improvement?** Yes, marginally. Ruling out the early-February left tail (F1's P10=Feb-28 implied ~10% chance the game was already complete) was correct given the research confirmation. The ensemble average was the right central estimate given unresolvable judgment disagreement.

### Supervisor Scoring Rubric

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Disagreement Identification** | 4/4 | Correctly identifies all 3 major disagreements, accurately characterizes sides, correctly prioritizes impact |
| **Query Generation** | 4/4 | Tightly targeted at factual disagreements, appropriate source types, Agent query for current status is exactly right |
| **Research Novelty** | 3/4 | Surfaced genuinely new Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 info; confirmed no reset. Couldn't find Feb-26 stream state — but that information likely didn't exist publicly. |
| **Reasoning & Reconciliation** | 3/4 | Correctly resolved factual portion; correctly labeled core disagreement as judgment-based; distribution barely changed but LOW confidence is honest. Slight deduction for not articulating how Opus 4.6's improvements should shift the distribution. |

**Supervisor Score:** 14/16

### Supervisor Impact Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ensemble weighted average (pre-supervisor) | P50 ≈ Jun-20, P90 ≈ Nov-15 (avg of 5 forecasters) |
| Supervisor prediction (post-supervisor) | P50 ≈ Jun-20, P90 ≈ Nov-25 |
| Adjustment magnitude | Negligible — primarily trimmed F1's Feb-28 left tail |
| Was the adjustment an improvement? | Yes, marginally — correctly ruled out the already-completed scenario |

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Strong iterative planner query generation** — the new o3-powered research planner produced a notably well-structured query plan, with explicit gap analysis, tool assignments per query, and a reasoned 60/40 historical/current split. A clear improvement over the Feb 1 run of this same question, which used a simpler, less structured query set.

2. **Strong outside view diversity** — three distinct analytical approaches (scenario tree, log-normal convolution, hazard model) among the five forecasters produced meaningfully different distributions. The ensemble captured real uncertainty about the core judgment call (F1: 90% by Oct 1 vs. F5: 40%).

3. **Supervisor correctly diagnosed and handled judgment-based disagreement** — the low confidence rating and minimal adjustment to the distribution was the right call for a disagreement that research couldn't resolve. Better than falsely high confidence or mechanical splitting.

### Weaknesses

1. **F5's inside view made zero update** — the self-loop o3 instance produced an identical distribution at both stages. This suggests that o3, when receiving its own very pessimistic outside view, simply ratified it in the inside view rather than genuinely re-evaluating the evidence. Cross-model pairing (receiving GPT-5.2 or Sonnet input) prompted more meaningful engagement.

2. **Current research couldn't close the critical information gap** — as of Feb 26, no public source confirmed whether Claude was still stuck in Victory Road or had reset. This left all forecasters working from four-week-old information. While this is a genuine data availability problem, it suggests that for streaming/real-time events, the current query design may need a fallback to direct stream-checking or social media.

3. **Agent report timeline hallucination on GPT-5** — the hallucinated "February 2025" date for GPT-5's completion was a minor quality issue in the historical research. The Agent query should ideally be verified against at least one confirming source before being passed to forecasters.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

Good overall research intake with the new planner, strong outside view quality from three of five forecasters, and a supervisor that correctly diagnosed the unresolvable judgment disagreement. Penalized to B (rather than A) for: F5's zero-update inside view (structural), the current-search data gap, and the agent hallucination.

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Add a direct stream status query** for ongoing event-tracking questions. For "Claude Plays Pokémon," a query like "site:twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon OR site:x.com 2026-02" or a direct AskNews query for the Twitch channel name would be more targeted than the general news queries that failed to find Feb-26 state.

2. **Agent report timeline verification** — when Agent queries produce specific dates, add a light verification pass against a confirming Google/Google News query. The GPT-5 completion date discrepancy (Feb 2025 vs. Aug 2025) could have been caught by a check against the MARCA article date.

3. **Consider AskNews as a real-time monitor for active experiments** — for questions about live Twitch streams, AskNews's news recency window may be better suited than Google (which surfaces older articles). The current AskNews query was appropriately targeted ("hiatus, technical issues, resets in 2026") but AskNews returned irrelevant Pokémon anniversary articles instead of stream-specific news, suggesting the query phrasing could be tightened to include the Twitch channel name.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Prevent zero-update inside views** — consider adding a required sentence to the inside view prompt for numeric/date questions: "If your distribution is unchanged from the outside view, explicitly state why the current news provided zero new information." This would force engagement with the evidence or explicit acknowledgment that no update is warranted.

2. **Cross-pollination diversity for date questions** — the self-loop pairings (S2-1: Sonnet ← Sonnet, S2-5: o3 ← o3) both produced negligible or zero updates. For questions with high outside-view divergence, consider always forcing cross-model pairings at S2 to maximize diversity. At minimum, both o3 instances receiving the same conservative outside view created redundancy at the pessimistic end of the ensemble.

3. **Supervisor threshold calibration** — with divergence at 0.1379 (3× threshold) and a LOW confidence result that barely changed the distribution, this case illustrates that high divergence doesn't always mean the supervisor can improve the forecast. Consider adding a "judgment vs. factual" classification in the supervisor's analysis output that could automatically determine whether to apply the supervisor's prediction or default to the ensemble average.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **o3 (S2-5):** Zero update between outside and inside view is a recurring pattern to watch. When o3 anchors very conservatively via its own outside view and receives that same view back via cross-pollination, it does not self-correct. The inside view prompt may need to be strengthened to specifically ask o3: "Does any piece of current news change your probability estimate, even marginally? Why or why not?"
- **Sonnet 4.6 (S2-1 and S2-2):** The S2-2 pairing (Sonnet ← o3) worked well — Sonnet 4.6 appropriately moderated o3's extreme conservatism. S2-1 (Sonnet ← Sonnet self) was essentially inert. This suggests Sonnet 4.6 benefits from cross-model exposure and performs better when challenged by a more conservative input.
- **GPT-5.2 (S2-3):** Strong update logic — correctly identified the key inside-view fact (no completion confirmed today) and applied it systematically. The date-question framing (shifting P10 from before today to after today) is textbook correct.
