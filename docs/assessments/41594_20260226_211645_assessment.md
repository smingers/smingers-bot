## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| S2-2 response truncated | High | S2-2 | Forecaster 2 inside view hit the 5,000-token output limit, returning null; aggregation ran on only 4 of 5 forecasters |
| Extreme S1 spread (0.6%–55%) | Medium | S1-4, S1-5 vs S1-1, S1-2 | o3 anchors almost entirely on a narrow Iran-specific base rate (~0.6–1.3%) while Sonnets anchor on qualitative context (~44–55%); the spread is legitimate methodology but creates aggregation instability |
| S2-2 would have received a 0.6% outside view | Medium | S2-2 | S2-2 (Sonnet 4.6) was supposed to receive S1-4's 0.6% outside view — the most extreme low anchor — and would likely have produced the largest inside-view update; its failure means the aggregation under-represents that cross-pollination path |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (1 historical query) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (Wikipedia articles from question description) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. `[HISTORICAL] list of United States military operations 1990-2025` (Google) — broad base-rate anchor
2. `[HISTORICAL] United States direct attacks on Iran timeline` (Google) — Iran-specific base rate
3. `[HISTORICAL] carrier strike group deployments Persian Gulf crisis periods` (Google) — correlation between deployments and strikes
4. `[HISTORICAL] War Powers Resolution votes or authorizations regarding Iran` (Google) — congressional constraint precedent
5. `[HISTORICAL] Agent query: discrete calendar quarters of US kinetic action against sovereign states since 1989` (Agent) — quantified base rate calculation

**Current Queries** (tools: Google News, AskNews):
6. `[CURRENT] carrier deployment Gulf February 2026 CENTCOM` (Google News) — current force posture
7. `[CURRENT] Trump administration deliberates Iran strike February 2026` (AskNews) — near-term intent signals
8. `[CURRENT] back-channel talks or de-escalation US Iran 2026` (Google News) — diplomatic off-ramps

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Pre-2026 precedent, long-run patterns | Feb 2026 events, diplomatic/military developments |
| Content type | Operation timelines, base rates, deployment correlations, legal constraints | Force posture, White House deliberations, Geneva talks |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Quantified base rate (8.6%/quarter), Iran-specific precedent (1988, 2025), WPR constraints | Two-carrier posture, CBS readiness reporting, Rubio/Ratcliffe congressional briefing, Geneva talks same day |

**Analysis:**
- The historical and current query sets are well-separated with virtually no overlap. Historical queries build priors and precedents; current queries target the specific decision window.
- The Agent query (historical) was particularly valuable — it produced a rigorous 35-year base rate computation (12/140 quarters = 8.6%), directly comparable to the 33-day horizon.
- Query 3 (carrier deployments and strikes) targeted an important indicator class but returned mostly pre-2025 historical data; the February 2026 buildup was covered by current queries instead.
- The absence of FRED/yFinance is appropriate — the question is geopolitical, not economic.
- Question URL scraping surfaced the key Wikipedia articles linked in the question background (Iranian Revolution, Iran-Israel war, 2026 military buildup, Operation Midnight Hammer), providing seed context before queries were generated.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report (base rate analysis) stays appropriately factual, listing operations with dates and computing frequency — it explicitly defers to the user to "adjust for present-day situational factors." AskNews and Google News results are summaries of reported events, not probability estimates. The Sentinel Team's 59% estimate appears in the question description itself (not from a research query) and is treated by forecasters as an expert anchor, not an independent research finding. No research output inappropriately offered probability forecasts.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** Operation Midnight Hammer (June 2025) as direct precedent; 8.6%/quarter empirical base rate; Bahrain Fleet HQ drawdown to <100 personnel mirroring pre-June 2025 conditions (Fox News, Feb 26); CBS News reporting military was ready for strikes "as early as Saturday, Feb 21"; Rubio/Ratcliffe congressional briefing (Feb 24); Geneva talks on same day as forecast; Witkoff/Kushner urging against strikes; Trump's Jan 28 explicit decision not to strike; Azores/Crete bases activated (same infrastructure as Operation Midnight Hammer); State Dept Lebanon embassy partial evacuation.
- **Critical information missed:** No specific information about whether the Feb 26 Geneva talks produced any agreement (the talks were same-day, so real-time results were unavailable). No direct U.S. polling on support for a new Iran strike (a Feb 2025 poll was referenced but not a current one). The article on U.S. military capabilities against deeply buried Iranian sites (post-June 2025 BDA) is not well covered.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News: High — returned CBS News, RFE/RL, The Aviationist, The War Zone, Jerusalem Post, multiple credible outlets with named sources
  - Agent report: Excellent — transparent methodology, lists all 12 initiation quarters, computes base rate precisely
  - AskNews articles: High — returned Feb 23–26, 2026 reporting from NYT, WSJ, CBS, Washington Post, Axios secondary coverage with high-quality primary sourcing
  - Question URL scraping: Very high — the Wikipedia articles (esp. Operation Midnight Hammer and 2026 Military Buildup) were directly decision-relevant and pre-loaded before query generation

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Exemplary. Evaluates 9 source categories with explicit quality ratings — distinguishes Wikipedia background articles (high quality, historical only) from the Bahrain Fleet HQ Fox News report (credible signal), CGTN (state media, some bias), agent base-rate report (methodologically sound), and Sentinel's 59% estimate (expert opinion, pre-January, note that traders think it's too high). Correctly identifies the Operation Midnight Hammer Wikipedia article as "critical" and the Bahrain drawdown as "very relevant."
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 reference classes: (1) generic U.S. quarterly attack rate, (2) U.S. attacks on Iran specifically, (3) situations with active buildup + prior precedent, (4) Trump administration escalation-to-strike patterns. Correctly dismisses RC1 as too broad and RC2 as too narrow due to small N. Selects RC3+RC4 as "most suitable" with sound reasoning.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly calculates 33 days remaining (as of Feb 26). Lists key temporal facts: Trump's Jan 28 explicit decision against strikes, the Feb 26 Bahrain signal, Geneva talks ongoing, Iran's military drills. Good analysis of why 33 days is a short but meaningful window.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Adjusts from 8.6% generic quarterly rate to ~44% via a qualitative multi-factor reasoning chain. The adjustment is not mathematically precise (no explicit log-odds or multiplier), but the reasoning is internally consistent and the final estimate is well-justified. Weights the Bahrain signal heavily while discounting for diplomacy and Trump's January decision.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 44% probability with explicit weighing of up/down factors. Considers both Yes (Bahrain signal, SOTU commitment, military buildup) and No (Geneva talks, Witkoff opposition, Jan decision against strikes) pathways. Good balance.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Very thorough — evaluates approximately 25 distinct sources with explicit quality ratings (High/Moderate/Low). Correctly identifies the CBS News Feb 20 report ("military ready as early as Saturday") as "very significant" and "high" quality. Correctly rates RT Arabic and state-sourced materials as "moderate." Flags the AI model date-prediction article as "Very Low/Irrelevant."
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies the same 4 classes as S1-1 with similar analysis. Less elaborate in distinguishing them, but arrives at the correct conclusion (RC3 + RC4).
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 33 days remaining. Provides useful half/double analysis: ~35-40% if halved (16 days), ~60-65% if doubled (66 days). Includes the USS George H.W. Bush mid-March arrival as a temporal factor.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Takes a novel systematic approach — starts from 44% (S1-1's base) then applies explicit +/- adjustments for each evidence category: +5% congressional briefing, +3% CBS readiness, +5% Azores/Crete active, -5% Geneva talks, -4% Witkoff opposition, etc. Net: ~43%, but recalibrates upward to 55% citing the weight of Feb 24-26 evidence (SOTU, Lebanon evacuation, expiring Trump deadline).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The uplift from 44% → 55% based on the "end of Trump's 10-15 day deadline" reasoning is more aggressive than S1-1's 44% anchor. The reasoning is internally consistent and evidence-supported. The simultaneous upward factors (congressional briefing, Lebanon evacuation, Azores/Crete active) do seem to justify some upward revision from S1-1's base.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Systematic and crisp — evaluates each source type in a numbered list with explicit quality rating and fact-vs-opinion distinction for each. Correctly classifies the Agent report as high quality for providing a "quantified historical frequency." Correctly treats Sentinel's 59% as "an expert/market-like signal" that is "still opinion." Explicitly flags CGTN as "state media with potential bias."
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes: RC1 (general U.S. vs. sovereign states, 8.6%/quarter), RC2 (U.S. vs. Iran specifically, tiny N), RC3 (U.S. vs. regional states). Chooses RC1 as "best numerical base rate" with Iran-salience adjustments — a principled statistical approach that prioritizes sample size over target specificity.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Mathematically explicit: converts 8.6%/quarter to 34-day probability using time-scaling formula: p ≈ 1-(1-0.086)^(34/91.25) ≈ 3.4%. This is the most mathematically rigorous time-adjustment in any S1 output.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Applies a 3-4x multiplier to the 3.4% time-adjusted base for Iran salience and recent kinetic precedent, yielding 10-15% range. Picks midpoint of 12.8%. This is a defensible, disciplined approach that avoids over-adjusting on inside-view signals.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- 12.8% is strikingly lower than S1-1 (44%) and S1-2 (55%). The disagreement is methodological, not factual: GPT-5.2 uses a strict base-rate anchor and applies only modest adjustments for specificity, while the Sonnets incorporate more current context into the outside view. Both approaches are legitimate; this divergence is a feature of the pipeline's multi-model design.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient and systematic — groups sources into numbered categories with explicit quality assessments. Treats the Wikipedia 2026 military buildup article as "weak evidence" due to "some statements lacking citations." Correctly identifies the agent base-rate analysis as "methodologically transparent."
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes with explicit pros/cons for each. Introduces a novel RC3: "follow-on U.S. strike on a state it hit within the previous 12 months" (estimated 2/300 state-quarters ≈ 0.7%). Chooses to start with RC1 (broad) and adjust downward toward RC2 (Iran-specific), yielding a very conservative prior.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Mathematically precise: converts 1.1%/quarter (Iran-specific RC2) to 0.42% over 34 days. Shows the calculation explicitly.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Applies a +0.3pp adjustment for "recently struck" serial correlation and -0.1pp for congressional constraint, yielding 0.6%. This is the most conservative outside-view derivation, almost entirely anchored on the narrow Iran-specific historical rate.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- 0.6% is an extreme low anchor. The methodology is defensible — it strictly applies the Iran-specific historical rate adjusted for the window. The reasoning is sound within its reference class choice. However, by deliberately excluding inside-view signals from the outside-view stage, this estimate is unusually low even as a prior. The large inside-view update (0.6% → 32%) shows the current evidence is powerful.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough systematic evaluation of all 11 sources, with each assessed for quality and fact-vs-opinion content. Useful note that CGTN entries "are low-opinion, easy to cross-check." Correctly rates agent report as "transparent methodology."
- **Reference Class Selection:** Introduces a distinctive RC2: "U.S. kinetic initiation against medium-to-large regional powers since 1989" (Iraq '91/'03, Yugoslavia '99, Libya '11 = 4 initiations / 35 years). This is more specific than RC1 and captures the "difficulty level" of attacking a defended state. Scaling to 35 days: 11% × (35/365) ≈ 1.1%.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Notes that "major strikes are seldom clustered this tightly" and that a 35-day horizon captures only the tail-end of an escalation cycle already in motion — a sensible observation that counsels caution about inside-view momentum.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Applies +0.4% serial correlation for recent Iran strike, -0.2% for War Powers vote signal, yielding 1.3%. Provides a ±50% confidence interval (0.65–1.95%).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Like S1-4, the 1.3% reflects a principled strict outside view. The "medium-to-large regional powers" reference class is an interesting methodological choice — it captures the difficulty of attacking a defended state like Iran vs. smaller/weaker adversaries. The insight about the 35-day window capturing only the "tail-end" of an in-motion escalation cycle is analytically sharp.

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 44% | 15/16 | Rich multi-factor analysis, best source evaluation | Adjustment to 44% lacks mathematical precision |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 55% | 14/16 | Systematic +/- adjustment framework, 25-source analysis | Upward revision to 55% relies on subjective weighting of recent signals |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 12.8% | 16/16 | Best mathematical rigor, explicit time-adjustment formula, principled base-rate discipline | Conservatively ignores qualitative context for outside view |
| S1-4 | o3 | 0.6% | 14/16 | Iran-specific reference class, cleanest base-rate derivation | 0.6% is an extreme anchor that may over-discount the current exceptional context |
| S1-5 | o3 | 1.3% | 14/16 | Distinctive "medium-to-large regional powers" reference class, confidence interval provided | Extreme low anchor, same limitations as S1-4 |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self-model) | 44% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 0.6% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | 55% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 12.8% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 1.3% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent. Categorizes ~17 pieces of evidence into Strong (6), Moderate (7), and Weak (4) with explicit causal mechanisms for each. Correctly identifies the congressional briefing + Lebanon evacuation and the Azores/Crete base activation as "Strong" upward factors, and Witkoff/Kushner opposition + Geneva talks as "Moderate" downward factors.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 44% → Output: 47%, Δ = +3%) The small update is justified — the inside-view evidence is roughly balanced, and the most distinctive new signals (CBS readiness, congressional briefing) were partially offset by Geneva talks and Witkoff opposition. The reasoning for the modest net upward shift is transparent and sound.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses half/double analysis: if halved (~16 days) → ~35-40%; if doubled (~66 days) → ~60-65%. Correctly notes that the USS George H.W. Bush arrives mid-March (within window), adding relevance.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and substantive — all 6 elements addressed: (1) resolution paraphrase, (2) base rate stated, (3) consistency check ("47 out of 100 times"), (4) top 5 evidence items, (5) blind spot (Geneva breakthrough would push true prob to ~15-20%), (6) status quo bias explicitly acknowledged (-2-3% for inertia, but resisted).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The update direction (upward) is consistent with the evidence direction (pre-strike operational signals dominate). The final 47% is internally consistent with the stated reasoning of near-equal probability of strikes vs. diplomatic resolution. The insight that the question window ("April 1") captures the USS George H.W. Bush's full deployment window is astute.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** N/A — response truncated after 5,000 tokens before any useful output was captured.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 0.6% → Output: null) This would have been the most interesting cross-pollination path: a Sonnet 4.6 model receiving an extreme 0.6% outside view and updating it with strong inside-view evidence. The truncation means we cannot observe this pathway.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** N/A
- **Calibration Checklist:** N/A

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The failure is consequential: S2-2 was supposed to observe how a Sonnet model receiving a very conservative o3 baseline would update. Based on S2-1's behavior (moderate update from 44% to 47%), we might expect S2-2 would have produced a large update from 0.6% toward something like 35-50%. The aggregation losing this data point is a meaningful gap.

- **Score:** N/A (failed, excluded from aggregation)

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework explicitly with causal mechanisms. Strong: large-scale force positioning (multiple independent sources), active deliberations (CBS/NYT-reported readiness). Moderate: diplomatic off-ramp, internal executive friction. Weak: Congressional rhetoric, AI date-picking. Correctly weights the convergence of multi-source evidence as a strong signal.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 55% → Output: 58%, Δ = +3%) The small update is somewhat conservative given the strong inside-view signals, but defensible — the inside-view evidence adds detail to what the outside view already incorporated (the Sonnets had already discounted some current context into their 55% anchor). The asymmetric framing ("either a limited strike [Yes] or a thin deal [No]") is perceptive.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicit analysis: halved (~17 days) → probability drops "somewhat but remains elevated" because carriers already on station; doubled (~68 days) → rises materially because of unresolved nuclear dispute. Good reasoning.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete — all 6 elements present. Paraphrase is crisp. Consistency line: "58 out of 100 times." Top evidence items (≤20 words each) are precisely stated. Blind spot identified (rapid provocation/retaliation spiral).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The update direction (upward, +3%) is consistent with the net evidence tilt. Note that GPT-5.2 receiving the high 55% Sonnet anchor barely moved. This is appropriate — there's not much room above 55% given the diplomatic off-ramp signals. The 58% result is an honest assessment.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses explicit log-odds adjustments (+1.0 for confirmed force deployment, +0.4 for presidential deadline/precedent, -0.4 for active negotiations, -0.2 for Pentagon/allied caution). Correctly identifies military posture reports from multiple independent outlets as the strongest signal. Notes Sentinel's 59% as a "crowd wisdom" anchor and nudges toward it slightly.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 12.8% → Output: 32%, Δ = +19.2%) The large update is justified given that the inside-view evidence overwhelmingly points toward elevated probability. The log-odds framework ensures a principled update. The narrative ("a strike is neither certain nor remote…roughly one-third of timelines end with at least one US bomb") is well-calibrated.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but present: if halved (17 days) → falls roughly one-third; if doubled (68 days) → rises to ~45%. The observation that "a second CSG would not arrive" if halved is a concrete mechanistic link between time and probability.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete — all 6 elements present with quality content. Blind spot (rapid Israeli solo raid triggering US intervention) is highly scenario-specific and valuable.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- This is the most interesting cross-pollination path: an o3 inside-view model receiving GPT-5.2's more moderate 12.8% outside view. The large update is well-reasoned and reflects appropriate use of the current evidence. The final 32% sits between the extreme low S1 anchors and the Sonnet/GPT inside views.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong/Moderate/Weak framework with concrete source citations. Strong: confirmed two CSGs + 40,000 troops + aircraft, Trump public 10-15 day ultimatum + June 2025 precedent, Gang-of-Eight targeting briefing. Moderate: active diplomatic channel, military caution/ammo concerns. Weak: AI date-picking, anonymous op-eds. Good triage.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 1.3% → Output: 33%, Δ = +31.7%) The largest update in the ensemble. The Fermi split approach is explicit and elegant: P(talks succeed)=20% × P(strike|talks succeed)=5% + P(talks fail)=80% × P(strike|talks fail)=40% = 33%. The individual branch probabilities (20% chance talks succeed, 40% strike if they fail) are plausible estimates well-grounded in the evidence.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Provides a distinctive insight: the window probability is "front-loaded" because the political decision-making is already in motion. Halving to 17 days only reduces estimate from ~25% to ~20% (not proportionally), while doubling to 70 days only raises it slightly (~30%) — reflecting that the key variable is the decision, not time. This is analytically sharp.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete — all 6 elements present. Blind spot (Khamenei death or sudden Iranian capitulation → probability drops below 10%) is a useful tail scenario. Status-quo bias check explicitly keeps final estimate well below 50%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The 33% output from a 1.3% outside view anchor demonstrates the pipeline working as designed: a strict base-rate prior being substantially updated by overwhelming inside-view evidence. The Fermi decomposition (talks branch / no-talks branch) is the cleanest analytical structure in any S2 output.

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 44% | 47% | +3% | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 0.6% | null | — | N/A (failed) | N/A |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 55% | 58% | +3% | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 12.8% | 32% | +19.2% | 15/16 | Yes |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Did cross-model instances engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**
Yes, all three cross-model instances used their received outside view as a genuine anchor. S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's 12.8%) explicitly stated it was adjusting from a 12.8% baseline using log-odds. S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet's 55%) treated 55% as its starting point for evidence adjustment. The failed S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's 0.6%) cannot be assessed.

**Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**
S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving 55%) may have slightly under-weighted the inside-view evidence — a +3% update from 55% given the CBS readiness reports and congressional briefings seems modest. The outside-view anchor at 55% likely anchored the final estimate conservatively. S2-4 and S2-5 both updated dramatically from their low anchors, which is appropriate given the strength of the inside-view evidence.

**Same-model vs. cross-model instances:**
- S2-1 (Sonnet, self-pollination from Sonnet): 44% → 47% (+3%)
- S2-3 (GPT-5.2, cross-pollinated from Sonnet): 55% → 58% (+3%)
- S2-5 (o3, self-pollination): 1.3% → 33% (+31.7%)
- S2-4 (o3, cross-pollinated from GPT-5.2): 12.8% → 32% (+19.2%)

Notably, the two o3 inside-view outputs (S2-4 and S2-5) converged tightly at 32-33% regardless of whether they received a 1.3% or 12.8% outside view. This suggests the o3 inside-view reasoning was strongly driven by the current evidence rather than the anchor — a reassuring sign of robustness.

**Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity?**
Cross-pollination partially reduced diversity: the four valid inside-view outputs span 32-58% (a 26pp spread), compared to the S1 spread of 0.6-55% (a 54.4pp spread). The inside-view evidence functioned as a strong anchoring force pulling all models toward a higher probability, regardless of their S1 starting point. The Sonnets/GPT-5.2 cluster at 47-58% while the o3 outputs cluster at 32-33%, creating a bimodal distribution that was then averaged to 42.5%.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: a physical U.S. military attack affecting Iranian territory or military personnel before April 1, 2026. The fine print exclusion of cyberattacks and warning shots was correctly noted by S2-5 in its paraphrase.
- All instances correctly identified the 33-34 day remaining window as of Feb 26, 2026.
- All instances correctly identified that June 2025 (Operation Midnight Hammer) had already established a precedent and that Trump had explicitly decided against further strikes in late January 2026.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. The U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites in June 2025 (Operation Midnight Hammer) — the first U.S. strike on Iranian territory since 1988
2. Trump explicitly decided against strikes in late January 2026, then resumed escalatory posture
3. As of Feb 26, the Bahrain Fleet HQ was reduced to <100 personnel with ships leaving port, mirroring pre-June 2025 strike preparations

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1, S1-2 | Minor temporal ambiguity | Both quote "33 days remaining" though the exact count from Feb 26 to April 1 is 33 days — correct, no error | Low |
| S2-4 | Slight rounding | States resolution window as "34 days" vs. 33 days (depending on whether April 1 is counted); consistent within its own analysis | Low |
| S1-2 | Characterizes Feb 21 CBS readiness as still meaningful despite non-occurrence | States "the strike didn't happen Feb 21, but the readiness is confirmed. The delay doesn't negate the readiness" — this is a fair analytical judgment, not a factual error | Low |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All key factual claims (Operation Midnight Hammer, Bahrain Fleet HQ drawdown, USS Gerald R. Ford deployment, Rubio/Ratcliffe congressional briefing, Geneva talks on Feb 26, Witkoff/Kushner opposition) are grounded in sourced material from the research context and accurately characterized.

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review

### Divergence & Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Divergence metric | std_dev |
| Divergence value | ~10.7 pp (std dev of [47, 58, 32, 33]) |
| Trigger threshold | 15.0 pp |
| Supervisor triggered? | No |
| Supervisor model | N/A |
| Supervisor confidence | N/A |
| Supervisor cost | N/A |

The divergence was 10.7 pp against a 15.0 pp threshold — a margin of ~4.3 pp below trigger. Notably, had S2-2 succeeded and produced a high estimate (which seems likely given Sonnet receiving a very low 0.6% anchor — it would likely have updated dramatically, perhaps to 40-55%), the spread might have exceeded the threshold and triggered the supervisor. The truncation failure may have inadvertently suppressed supervisor activation.

*Supervisor not triggered.*

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Outstanding research pipeline:** The iterative planner generated perfectly targeted historical and current queries with essentially zero redundancy. The Agent base-rate computation was rigorous and directly applicable. The Bahrain Fleet HQ signal, CBS readiness reporting, and congressional briefing were all successfully surfaced.
2. **Strong inside-view analysis across all four successful outputs:** All four S2 outputs demonstrated proper use of the Strong/Moderate/Weak evidence framework, complete calibration checklists, and thoughtful timeframe sensitivity analysis. The S2-5 Fermi decomposition (talks branch/no-talks branch) was particularly elegant.
3. **Methodological diversity:** The pipeline produced genuinely diverse reasoning approaches — strict base-rate (o3 at 0.6-1.3%), adjusted base-rate (GPT-5.2 at 12.8%), and qualitative multi-factor (Sonnets at 44-55%). The inside views converged these into a coherent 32-58% range, demonstrating the ensemble design is working as intended.

### Weaknesses
1. **S2-2 fatal truncation:** The 5,000-token output limit truncated Forecaster 2's inside view completely, forcing the aggregation to run on 4 of 5 forecasters. This is the most significant pipeline failure in this run — and the lost data point would have been the most interesting cross-pollination path (Sonnet receiving an extreme-low 0.6% outside view).
2. **Extreme S1 spread:** The 0.6-55% outside view spread is wide enough to raise questions about the pipeline's consistency. The two o3 outside views (0.6-1.3%) are not obviously wrong — they're principled pure base-rate estimates — but they anchor so low that the inside views must do enormous work to produce reasonable final outputs.
3. **S2-3 conservative update:** GPT-5.2 receiving a 55% outside view only updated to 58% (+3%) despite strong inside-view evidence (CBS readiness, congressional briefing, Lebanon evacuation). This moderate output anchored the aggregation's upper end conservatively — the final 42.5% may be slightly under-weighted given the pre-strike operational signals.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: [B+]**

The research quality is A-grade. The inside-view outputs are B+/A range for the four that completed. The S2-2 truncation failure and extreme S1 spread are notable issues that prevent an A grade, but do not fundamentally compromise the forecast's reliability.

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

- The query plan is very strong for this question type. No major gaps. One minor addition: a query specifically targeting what happened at the Feb 26 Geneva meeting (or confirming no deal was reached that day) would have sharpened the current-state assessment. However, this wasn't available in real-time due to the same-day timing.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

- **Increase the output token limit for S2:** The S2-2 failure was caused by the 5,000-token limit. The inside view prompts for binary questions generate long evidence-weighting analyses; 7,000-8,000 tokens would be safer. Alternatively, consider adding a truncation detection + retry with a shorter response hint when the limit is hit.
- **Consider capping S1 divergence:** The 54pp S1 spread (0.6-55%) is significantly larger than the 26pp S2 spread. The supervisor is calibrated to S2 spread, not S1 spread. A large S1 divergence can propagate to the supervisor calculation in ways that undercount the real methodological disagreement. Consider flagging or logging when S1 spread exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30pp) for diagnostic purposes.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **o3 (outside view):** Consistently produces very low probabilities from strict base-rate methods. This is methodologically defensible as a pure "outside view" but may under-serve the pipeline when pre-strike operational signals are unusually strong. Consider whether the outside-view prompt should more explicitly invite models to weight situational context alongside base rates, or whether the strict base-rate approach should be preserved as a deliberate counter-weight.
- **Sonnet 4.6 (inside view):** Excellent. S2-1 produced the highest-scored output in this run (16/16). The evidence categorization, calibration checklist, and timeframe sensitivity analysis were all exemplary.
- **GPT-5.2:** Strong outside-view rigor (16/16 for S1-3). The inside view was solid but slightly anchored by the high 55% prior. Worth monitoring whether GPT-5.2 systematically under-updates when receiving high outside-view anchors.

### Retrospective

**Outcome and calibration:** The question resolved **Yes**—the United States did attack Iran before April 2026—less than two days after the forecast (Feb 26 → resolution within ~48 hours). The ensemble had predicted **42.5%**; community consensus at forecast time was **74%**. So the forecast was underconfident on both dimensions: well below the crowd and wrong on direction (we gave No a slight edge in practice). The strike happened in the “imminent” window that several sources had flagged; the forecasters overweighted the possibility that diplomacy or presidential hesitation would hold.

**What the forecasters missed (knowable)**

1. **Operational signals were correctly aligned with strike execution.** The research pack included the Feb 26 report that the U.S. Fleet Headquarters in Bahrain had been reduced to fewer than 100 mission-critical personnel with ships having left port—explicitly described as mirroring pre–June 2025 strike preparations. S1-1 and S1-2 weighted this and landed at 44–55%; S1-4 and S1-5 largely dismissed it (“peacetime carrier deployments vastly outnumber strikes”) and stayed at 0.6–1.3%. The two o3s then revised up to 32–33% on the inside view, but the *aggregate* was pulled to 42.5% by equal-weighting. So the ensemble underweighted the Bahrain signal in the sense that a large share of the probability mass came from forecasters who had discounted it. In hindsight, that signal was a valid leading indicator; treating it as speculative or “single-sourced” was a reasoning error when the alternative was to treat it as a weak signal rather than ignore it.

2. **“Trump decided against strikes in late January” was over-weighted as a durable prior.** Multiple forecasters treated his late-January pullback as strong evidence that he would pull back again. The inside-view logic was “he has already decided not to strike once; pattern suggests he may do so again” and “Trump has historically blinked when a last-minute face-saving deal appeared.” That confuses *one* past decision with a *stable* preference. Once the buildup continued, the deadline (10–15 days from Feb 19–20) expired around forecast day, and Geneva was the last off-ramp. Giving heavy weight to the January “no” decision, without enough weight to “he can decide again, and the operational clock has moved,” was a blind spot.

3. **Geneva as off-ramp was over-weighted relative to the decision window.** Forecasters treated the Feb 26 Geneva talks as a live chance for a face-saving deal that would avert a strike. They had no evidence that Geneva was *succeeding*—only that it was *happening*. Treating “talks are occurring” as a strong probability-lowerer (e.g. −5% for “active diplomacy”) assumed that the presence of talks materially raised the chance of a deal. In reality, the strike occurred within two days, so either Geneva failed quickly or the decision was already made and talks were insufficient to change it. The blind spot was treating *diplomatic activity* as if it were *diplomatic progress*.

4. **Community at 74% was not used.** The assessment notes that community consensus at forecast time was 74%. The research and prompts did not feed that number into the ensemble; forecasters had Sentinel’s 59% (from earlier) and “some traders think it’s too high.” So the ensemble had no formal signal that the crowd was already at 74%. That’s a process gap: for binary questions where a current community or market probability exists, not incorporating it (or at least explaining the gap) increases the risk of being an outlier. The forecasters didn’t “miss” 74% in their reasoning—they weren’t given it—but the system missed an opportunity to anchor or sanity-check.

5. **Loss of S2-2 (truncation) may have cost an upward vote.** S2-2 received the lowest outside view (0.6–1.3% from o3). If that forecaster, like S2-4 and S2-5, had revised sharply upward on the same inside-view evidence, we would have had five votes instead of four and possibly a higher aggregate. We can’t know the counterfactual, but losing the one forecaster who was explicitly updating from “strike very unlikely” is a plausible reason the aggregate stayed at 42.5% instead of drifting toward the high-end forecasters (47%, 58%).

**What they got right**

- The evidence *for* a strike was identified and weighted by at least some forecasters: two CSGs, congressional briefing, Lebanon evacuation, Azores/Crete activity, Trump’s deadline, June 2025 precedent. S2-1’s 47% and S2-3’s 58% were in the right ballpark; the issue was that the *average* was pulled down by the two o3s’ low outside views and the failed S2-2.
- The possibility of a diplomatic off-ramp was real; the error was *how much* to down-weight the strike probability given that talks were occurring but outcome unknown.
- Timeframe sensitivity was acknowledged (e.g. “if halved, probability drops”; “decision window is front-loaded”). The resolution within two days is consistent with that “front-loaded” view—they just didn’t assign enough probability to the “strike soon” branch.

**Recency of “current” research (search_current.json)**

Publication dates of what actually reached the forecasters:

- **Summarized “current” search results (Google News, etc.):** The three main summarized articles in the current context were **The Aviationist Feb 13**, **RFE/RL Feb 11**, and **The War Zone Feb 11**—i.e. **13 and 15 days old** on forecast day (Feb 26). So the lead “current” content from the current-news query was **1–2 weeks stale**, not same-day.
- **AskNews:** The AskNews block contained articles with **Publish date Feb 19–26**, including **same-day** (Feb 26: The Hill, Charter97, RT Arabic, AL Masry Al Youm) and day-before (Feb 24–25: NY Post, J-Post, Sky News Arabia, etc.). So same-day and recent reporting was present, but mixed in a long list with older items (Feb 19, 15, 7; one Jan 16).
- **Other summarized items:** Modern Diplomacy (Feb 7), Fair Observer (undated), CFR (historical). So part of the “current” context was a week or more old or undated.
- **Bahrain Fleet HQ (Feb 26, Fox):** That report did **not** appear in search_current.json; it came from the **question-URL / seed context** (Wikipedia “2026 U.S. military buildup”), which was assembled in the historical/pre-research phase. So the single most operationally relevant same-day signal was not in the “current” search at all—it was in seed/URL scraping.

**Implication:** For a question that resolved within 48 hours, the pipeline’s “current” bucket was a mix of same-day (AskNews) and **2-week-old** summarized hits (Google News). The pipeline did not sort or label by publication date, so forecasters had no explicit signal that the first summarized “current” items were from Feb 11–13 rather than Feb 26. Stale summarized content can anchor the model on an older state of the world (e.g. “strike readiness as early as Saturday” was Feb 20–21; by Feb 26 that “Saturday” had already passed with no strike, but that nuance was buried in a long AskNews list).

**Takeaways (pipeline-actionable)**

- **Current-news recency:** The “current” research was not consistently recent. Summarized results from the current Google News query were 13–15 days old; same-day material came from AskNews but was unsorted and unlabeled by date. For short-horizon or fast-moving questions, the pipeline could: (1) prefer or require recent publication dates for what gets summarized as “current,” (2) sort or filter current results by date so the newest are prominent, or (3) inject publication dates into the context (e.g. “Summary (published Feb 13, 2026): …”) so the model can weight recency even if the pipeline doesn’t filter. This is topic-agnostic and automatable.
- A single past presidential “no” in a crisis is weak evidence for a second “no” when the military and political clock has moved (new deadline, new briefing, same posture).
- “Talks are happening” should move probability less than “talks are succeeding”; separate diplomatic activity from diplomatic progress.
- Where community or market consensus exists and is much higher (or lower) than the ensemble, consider feeding it in or flagging the discrepancy so forecasters can explicitly address the gap.
