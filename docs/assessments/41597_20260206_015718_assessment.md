## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster 1 extraction failure | High | S2-1 / Aggregation | Forecaster 1 (Sonnet 4.5) produced valid reasoning and probabilities [0, 55, 30, 15] but the extractor failed due to format mismatch ("Probabilities:" prefix vs. expected format). This forecaster was excluded from aggregation, reducing the ensemble to 4 members. |
| Forecaster 3 outside view truncation | Medium | S1-3 | GPT-5.2's outside view was truncated at 4000 tokens, so Forecaster 3 had no Step 1 output. Its inside view still proceeded using the cross-pollinated S1-2 input. |
| AskNews deep research quota exceeded | Medium | Research | AskNews deep research failed with "403012 - Usage limit exceeded" error. Regular AskNews articles (22 results) were still retrieved, but deeper analysis was unavailable. |
| High overlap between historical and current queries | Low | Research | Both query sets used near-identical Google queries ("FDIC failed bank list 2026"), reducing the diversity of information gathered. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "FDIC failed bank list 2026" (Google)
2. "US bank failure February 2026" (Google News)
3. "Provide FDIC failed bank entries from 1 Jan 2026 to 5 Feb 2026 and counts of U.S. bank failures occurring Jan-Apr each year 2010-2025; summarize any regulatory or market signals pointing to potential near-term failures" (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. "FDIC failed bank list 2026" (Google)
2. "US bank failure January 2026" (Google News)
3. "Show news on U.S. banks closed by the FDIC so far in 2026 and expert predictions of more failures before May 2026." (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2010-2025 base rates + 2026 YTD status | 2026 YTD status + forward-looking signals |
| Content type | FDIC data, historical counts, regulatory signals | News coverage, prediction market data, macro context |
| Unique contribution | Historical Jan-Apr failure counts, long-run base rates | AskNews articles (22 results), Polymarket odds, macro headlines |

**Analysis:**
- The Google queries are nearly identical between sets ("FDIC failed bank list 2026" appears in both), reducing query diversity. The Google News queries differ slightly (February vs. January).
- Historical queries excel via the agentic search, which generated a comprehensive report with Jan-Apr failure counts 2010-2025, unrealized loss data ($337B), and regulatory signals. This was the most valuable research output.
- Current queries uniquely contributed AskNews data (22 articles including Benzinga, Chicago Tribune, Coinfomania) and the critical Polymarket 18% data point.
- Critical gap: No queries specifically targeted FDIC Problem Banks List or CAMELS-rated institutions, which could provide forward-looking indicators of near-term failures.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remain appropriately factual. The agentic report provides data and analysis without asserting probabilities. The Benzinga article includes Polymarket's 18% market-implied probability, which is appropriately treated as market data rather than a forecast claim.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - 1 confirmed failure (Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust, Jan 30, 2026)
  - Detailed financial specifics ($261M assets, $212M deposits, $19.7M DIF cost)
  - Historical Jan-Apr failure counts 2010-2025
  - Polymarket 18% probability of another failure by March 31
  - Muted market reaction (KRE +2%, KBE +1.7%)
  - $337B unrealized securities losses system-wide
  - FDIC published new resolution templates Jan 2026
- **Critical information missed:**
  - FDIC Problem Banks List count and trend
  - Specific banks on supervisory watch
  - CRE delinquency rates by bank size tier
- **Source quality:** Strong mix of primary (FDIC) and secondary (Benzinga, Chicago Tribune) sources. Promotional content (ITM Trading) appropriately identified and discounted by all forecasters.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough, evaluates each source individually with quality ratings. Correctly identifies ITM Trading as promotional. Distinguishes FDIC facts from Benzinga opinion. Notes Polymarket data as aggregated market opinion. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 reference classes, evaluates fit of each, selects post-2018 period (2018-2025) with clear justification. Correctly notes 2010-2012 is irrelevant. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Accurately calculates 36 days elapsed/84 remaining. Provides year-by-year historical failure timing. Notes clustering pattern (2020, 2023). (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear derivation from 8-year distribution. Shows 0:50%, 1:25%, 2:25%, 3+:0% unconditional. Then conditions on 1 failure observed. Adjusts with specific reasoning. Final: 0:0%, 1:50%, 2:30%, 3+:20%. (3/4 - 20% for 3+ seems slightly high given 0/8 years had 3+ in reference class)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Equally thorough as S1-1. Properly distinguishes promotional content. Notes agent report quality. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same reference class (2018-2025). Additionally examines conditional distribution: "Of 4 years with Jan-Apr failures, 3 had exactly 1 (2024, 2025, 2019) and 1 had 2 (2020, 2023 both had 2)." However, inaccuracy: 2019 had zero Jan-Apr failures (first was May 31) and 2020 and 2023 both had 2. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Accurate calculations. Includes conditional analysis of what happened in years with failures by early Feb. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Well-structured. Derives conditional probabilities from years with ≥1 failure. Final: 0:0%, 1:55%, 2:35%, 3+:10%. More conservative on tail than S1-1. (4/4)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Truncated at 4000 tokens** - no usable output produced.
- All dimensions: N/A

- **Score:** 0/16 (excluded due to truncation)

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Detailed 7-source analysis with quality ratings. Excellent treatment of ITM Trading as promotional. Correctly treats agent report as "informed but unverified" for qualitative remarks. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses 2016-2025 (10 years) as reference class with mean 1.1, noting counts {2,3,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,1}. This is a slightly broader window than S1-1/S1-2's 2018-2025. Both defensible. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Quantitative Poisson model: λ=0.75 for full period, λ_remaining≈0.53. Calculates P(0 more)=59%, P(1 more)=31%, etc. Then fattens tails based on empirical evidence. Excellent analytical rigor. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses Poisson model as foundation, then adjusts for fat tails. Cross-checks against Polymarket. Final: 0:0%, 1:57%, 2:28%, 3+:15%. Mathematically grounded. (4/4)

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Same quality as S1-4. Identifies same sources with consistent quality assessments. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses 2018-2025 as primary, with 2016-2025 conditional analysis. Examines "years with ≥1 failure by 31 Jan" - only 2017 and 2025 qualify (outcomes 3 and 1). Small sample but useful. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 85 days remaining. Notes historical clustering tendency in Feb-Apr. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Combines base rate with conditional early-failure evidence and market pricing. Final: 0:0%, 1:55%, 2:28%, 3+:17%. Provides clear reasoning for tail mass. (4/4)

- **Score:** 14/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 0:0%, 1:50%, 2:30%, 3+:20% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 0:0%, 1:57%, 2:28%, 3+:15% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 0:0%, 1:55%, 2:35%, 3+:10% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | TRUNCATED (no S1 output available) |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 0:0%, 1:55%, 2:28%, 3+:17% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Exemplary application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong evidence: confirmed failure (eliminates "0"), historical pattern. Moderate: Polymarket 18%, market stability, idiosyncratic failure. Weak: crypto speculation, precious metals. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: [0, 50, 30, 20] → Output: [0, 55, 30, 15]. Delta: +5pp on "1", -5pp on "3+". Justified by isolation evidence and market calm. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly models halved window (60% → 65% for "1") and doubled window (35-40% for "1"). Identifies next 8 weeks as critical. (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 6 elements completed meaningfully. Paraphrase, base rate, consistency, key evidence, blind spot (rapid clustering), technical check (sum=100). (4/4)

**EXTRACTION FAILED** despite valid output. The extractor could not parse `**Probabilities:** [0, 55, 30, 15]` (bold formatting issue). This is a pipeline bug, not a forecaster quality issue.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Proper application of framework. Identifies 5 key evidence items with appropriate weighting. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: [0, 57, 28, 15] → Output: [0, 59, 31, 10]. Delta: +2pp on "1", +3pp on "2", -5pp on "3+". Modest adjustment toward "no further failures" given isolation evidence. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief mention of halved/doubled timeframe effects. Less detailed than S2-1. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Blind spot: abrupt funding/liquidity shock hitting a weak regional bank. (3/4)

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good use of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly identifies FDIC list as strong evidence, Polymarket as moderate, macro chatter as weak. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: [0, 55, 35, 10] → Output: [0, 65, 25, 10]. Delta: +10pp on "1", -10pp on "2", unchanged "3+". Justified by market stability, idiosyncratic failure, and Polymarket consensus. Reasonable direction. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses halved (42 days → more "1") and doubled (170 days → more "2" and "3+"). Quantitative estimates provided. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate, base rate anchored, consistency check passes, blind spot identified (hidden cluster of weak small banks). (4/4)

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 (TRUNCATED)

Note: S1-3 was truncated, so S2-4 effectively had no cross-pollinated outside view input. It appears to have received the outside view from S1-5 based on the content.

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but effective. Strong: FDIC confirms 1 failure, historical pattern. Moderate: Polymarket 18%, clean resolution. Weak: macro volatility. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Constructed its own base rate since S1 input was missing. Final: [1, 74, 20, 5]. Most confident in "1" of all forecasters. The 1% for "0" is a creative hedging against possible FDIC relisting. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but adequate. Notes that halving window cuts "≥1 more failure" probability by one-third. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Abridged but covers all elements. Blind spot: sudden deposit run triggering companion closures. (3/4)

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework application. Strong: FDIC list, post-2018 history. Moderate: Polymarket 18%, conditional pattern. Weak: commentators, media speculation. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: [0, 55, 28, 17] → Output: [0, 62, 25, 13]. Delta: +7pp on "1", -3pp on "2", -4pp on "3+". Justified by isolation evidence and market calm while preserving tail risk. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Provides quantitative adjustments for halved (raise "1" by ~8pp) and doubled (lower "1" by 10-12pp) windows. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Abridged but complete. All 6 elements present. Blind spot: CRE-linked regional bank failure triggering knock-ons. (3/4)

- **Score:** 13/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final (0/1/2/3+) | Delta from S1 | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 0/50/30/20 | 0/55/30/15 | +5/0/-5 on 1/2/3+ | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 0/57/28/15 | 0/59/31/10 | +2/+3/-5 on 1/2/3+ | 13/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 0/55/35/10 | 0/65/25/10 | +10/-10/0 on 1/2/3+ | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | (truncated) | 1/74/20/5 | N/A (no S1) | 12/16 | Partial |
| S2-5 | o3 | 0/55/28/17 | 0/62/25/13 | +7/-3/-4 on 1/2/3+ | 13/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):** S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3's S1-4) engaged meaningfully, making a modest adjustment. S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet 4.5's S1-2) made the largest adjustment (+10pp on "1"), showing genuine integration. S2-4 (o3) had no valid S1 input due to truncation, so cross-pollination was effectively absent.
- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 ← self) made a small directional shift. S2-5 (o3 ← self) made a moderate shift (+7pp). Both behaved similarly to cross-model instances.
- **Diversity impact:** Cross-pollination slightly reduced diversity - all forecasters moved in the same direction (toward higher "1" probability), reflecting genuine consensus. The spread on "1" (58.4%-74.0%) is moderate and healthy for a multiple-choice question.
- **S2-4 anomaly:** Without valid S1 input, S2-4 became the most extreme outlier (74% on "1"), possibly because it lacked the anchoring effect that the other forecasters received from their S1 inputs.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: count FDIC-listed failures with closing dates between Jan 1 and Apr 30, 2026.
- All correctly identified the 120-day forecast window and calculated remaining time (~84-85 days).
- All correctly identified the current state: 1 confirmed failure (Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust, Jan 30, 2026).

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust was the first and only 2026 failure, closed Jan 30 by Illinois regulators
2. Bank size: $261.1M assets, $212.1M deposits, $19.7M DIF cost
3. Historical Jan-Apr failure counts 2018-2025: 0,0,2,0,0,2,1,1
4. Polymarket: 18% probability of another failure by March 31
5. Market reaction was muted (KRE up ~2%)
6. $337B unrealized securities losses system-wide

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-2 | Minor miscount | Claims "3 had exactly 1" for years with failures, but 2019 had 0 Jan-Apr failures | Low |
| S2-4 | 1% for "0" | Assigns 1% to "0 failures" despite confirmed January failure; justified as hedge against FDIC relisting but functionally wrong | Low |
| Coinfomania | Factual error | Claims "no bank collapses in 2025" - contradicted by FDIC data showing 2 failures in 2025 | Low (caught by S2-3) |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All factual claims trace back to research sources (FDIC data, Benzinga/Polymarket, news articles).

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research quality:** The agentic search produced a highly valuable comprehensive report with Jan-Apr failure counts 2010-2025, regulatory signals, and macro context. Historical and current research complemented each other well.
2. **Strong analytical consistency:** All 5 forecasters reached similar conclusions (1 failure most likely at 50-74%, meaningful tail risk for 2), using similar reference classes and evidence. This consensus emerged independently, suggesting the evidence genuinely points in this direction.
3. **Appropriate evidence weighting:** All forecasters correctly identified Metropolitan Capital's failure as idiosyncratic and appropriately discounted promotional content (ITM Trading). The Polymarket 18% figure was consistently used as an anchor.
4. **Rigorous methodology:** S1-4's Poisson model approach was particularly strong, providing a mathematical foundation for the distribution that other forecasters approximated intuitively.

### Weaknesses
1. **Extraction failure:** Forecaster 1's probabilities were valid but couldn't be parsed, reducing the ensemble from 5 to 4 members. The bold markdown formatting of "**Probabilities:**" caused the extractor to fail.
2. **GPT-5.2 truncation:** Forecaster 3's outside view was truncated at 4000 tokens, eliminating one S1 output and disrupting the cross-pollination chain (S2-4 received no valid S1 input).
3. **Query overlap:** Historical and current Google queries were nearly identical, wasting a search slot.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| **B+** | **Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling** |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The forecast demonstrates strong research, consistent analytical reasoning, and appropriate calibration across the working ensemble members. The B+ rather than A reflects the extraction failure (reducing ensemble to 4/5), the GPT-5.2 truncation (disrupting cross-pollination), and the query overlap. The final distribution [1.0%, 64.5%, 25.0%, 9.4%] is well-calibrated given available evidence.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Diversify Google queries between historical and current sets to avoid duplication
- Add targeted queries for FDIC Problem Banks List count and CRE delinquency rates
- Monitor AskNews quota usage to avoid mid-pipeline failures

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Fix extraction logic to handle bold markdown formatting in probability outputs (the `**Probabilities:** [0, 55, 30, 15]` pattern should be parseable)
- Increase `max_output_tokens` for GPT-5.2 to prevent truncation (currently 4000 tokens)
- When S1 output is truncated/missing, provide the outside view prompt context directly to S2 rather than leaving the cross-pollination slot empty

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Consistently strong performance. Both S1 outputs were high quality. S2-1's evidence framework was exemplary.
- **GPT-5.2:** Truncation at 4000 tokens is problematic. When it did produce output (S2-3), quality was good with a reasonable +10pp adjustment. Token limit needs increasing.
- **o3:** S1-4's Poisson model approach was the strongest analytical framework. S2-4 was the most confident (74% on "1") possibly due to missing S1 input, but reasoning was still sound.

---

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp (binary) / >20% of range (numeric) | No | "1" spread is 15.6pp (58.4-74.0%); reasonable for MC |
| Update direction errors | No | All forecasters shifted toward higher "1" probability |
| Factual errors present | Yes | Minor: Coinfomania "no 2025 failures" claim; S1-2 miscount |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Disrupted by S1-3 truncation; otherwise functional |
| Critical info missed in research | No | All key facts surfaced; FDIC Problem Banks List would be nice-to-have |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | No | S2-4 (74% on "1") is highest but within reasonable range |
