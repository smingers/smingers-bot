## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster 4 (o3) likely hallucinated Feb→Mar historical base rate | Med | S1-4 | Claims "March > February in 22 of 45 years (48.9%)" with no source data to compute this. The FRED data block only contains recent monthly values, not decade-by-decade Feb/Mar pairs. Likely drawn from model's pre-training knowledge rather than provided sources. |
| Forecaster 5 (o3) computed a different hallucinated base rate | Med | S1-5 | Claims "March > February in 25 of 46 years (54%)" — a contradictory figure from the same putative dataset. Neither calculation is traceable to any provided source, confirming these are model-knowledge artifacts rather than evidence-derived. |
| Irrelevant German wine company article in research | Low | Research | Hawesko Holding SE (TradingView) article about a German wine retailer was included in historical context. All 5 forecasters correctly identified and dismissed it, so impact is negligible. |
| Incomplete Kiplinger article extraction | Low | Research | Kiplinger article content was not successfully extracted, yielding minimal usable information. A minor data gap that didn't materially affect the forecast. |
| Forecaster 1 large inside-view overcorrection | High | S2-1 | Dropped from 43% → 32% (−11pp), the largest shift in the ensemble. The −20% net adjustment from the outside view is aggressive relative to the incremental evidence quality. Morningstar's 54.3 forecast was given outsized weight despite being a single consensus estimate, and the arithmetic (−8% for Morningstar + −5% for Fed + −4% for hard data + −3% for Conference Board = −20%, offset by +8% upward) was applied mechanically without cross-checking against historical base rates. |
| Agent search failed to retrieve historical Feb/Mar data | Med | Research | The agentic search was tasked with "list Feb and Mar values back to 1980 and calculate the share of years when March > February" but was unable to retrieve this data due to FRED's one-month delay and website access limitations. This left the ensemble without the key base rate statistic for the outside view. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. `University of Michigan consumer sentiment monthly data` (Google)
2. `Consumer sentiment preliminary February 2026` (Google News)
3. `Retrieve UMCSENT series; list Feb and Mar values back to 1980 and calculate the share of years when March > February; also summarize recent trend and forecasts for March 2026.` (Agent)
4. `UMCSENT` (FRED)

**Current Queries:**
1. `Michigan consumer sentiment February 2026 forecast` (Google)
2. `US consumer sentiment early February 2026` (Google News)
3. `What are economists projecting for February and March 2026 University of Michigan consumer sentiment and the impact of inflation and job market?` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Long-run data series, base rates, trend context | Recent forecasts, near-term economic conditions |
| Content type | Official FRED data, economic calendar, historical values | Analyst projections, Fed commentary, sector data |
| Unique contribution | FRED time series (1952–2025), release schedule, consensus forecasts | Lisa Cook speech, auto sales collapse, Conference Board data, Morgan Stanley survey |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries correctly targeted base rate establishment (UMCSENT series, general sentiment data) while current queries surfaced decision-relevant news (Fed rhetoric, auto sales, economic forecasts).
- The FRED query (`UMCSENT`) was the standout addition — it returned comprehensive historical statistics including 1yr/5yr/all-time means, recent changes, and a clean monthly values table. This is the first test of the FRED integration tool and it worked exactly as designed.
- Critical gap: The Agent search was asked to compute the specific Feb→Mar base rate but failed to retrieve the necessary data. The FRED tool provided monthly values through December 2025 only (due to the 1-month publication delay), which did not include the full year-by-year Feb/Mar comparison table needed. This left forecasters without the single most important outside-view statistic.
- The current queries successfully surfaced the Morningstar consensus forecast (54.3 for Feb preliminary), Fed Governor Cook's speech, and auto sales data — all highly relevant.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Yes, but appropriately. The research outputs include market consensus forecasts (Investing.com: Feb preliminary 55.0, Feb final 56.4; TradingEconomics: Q1 2026 at 54.0) which are clearly labeled as forecasts rather than facts. The Agent report appropriately flagged its inability to compute base rates rather than fabricating one. The FRED data block was purely factual (historical values and computed statistics).

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** January 2026 final (56.4), December 2025 (52.9), February release schedule, consensus forecasts for February, full 2025 monthly trajectory via FRED, recent economic indicators (auto sales, Conference Board, Fed rhetoric)
- **Critical information missed:** Historical Feb→Mar direction base rate (the single most important outside-view statistic). The Agent tried but failed; FRED provided recent data but not the full year-by-year comparison. Two o3 instances later computed this from model knowledge (22/45 = 48.9% and 25/46 = 54%), but these cannot be verified from provided sources.
- **Source quality:** High overall. FRED data was authoritative. Investing.com and TradingEconomics provided reliable consensus figures. AskNews surfaced timely, relevant recent news (Fed Cook, auto sales, Morgan Stanley survey). Two irrelevant sources (Hawesko wine company, incomplete Kiplinger) were correctly identified and dismissed by all forecasters.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough — identified and rated all sources including FRED data. Correctly dismissed Hawesko and Kiplinger. Correctly noted FRED's 1-month delay means January 2026 isn't in the series yet. Rated agent report as "Medium" quality. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 4 candidate classes (all month-to-month, Feb-to-Mar 1980+, recent trend 2025-26, recovery from troughs). Chose a combination of Feb-to-Mar transitions and recent trend. Acknowledged lack of complete historical data for the preferred class. (3/4 — good framework but couldn't populate the best class)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 33-day window. Provided useful 2025 month-to-month changes from FRED data. Noted the late-2025 recovery pattern. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from ~50% generic baseline. Applied detailed but somewhat arbitrary adjustments (+10-15% momentum, +5% base effect, −10% 2025 precedent, −10% TradingEconomics, −5% structural concerns, −5% plateau). Arrived at 43%. The large net downward adjustment (−7pp from 50%) is reasonable but the individual factors feel somewhat manufactured given no computed reference class. (2/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 43% probability, considering both Yes and No pathways
- Anchored on competing professional forecasts without a clean base rate
- The reasoning was sound but somewhat circular — used 2025 Feb→Mar decline heavily despite correctly noting it's a single data point

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Exceptional — most detailed source-by-source evaluation. Distinguished facts from forecasts clearly. Noted the critical limitation that FRED data doesn't provide Feb→Mar frequency across years. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong framework with 4 candidates (Feb-to-Mar across years, any month-to-month, months during low-sentiment periods, recent 2024-2025). Selected combination of #3 and #4. Acknowledged data limitations honestly. However, over-weighted recent momentum (described +1.9, +1.5, +2.4 monthly increases but the Nov→Dec change was +1.9, not the claimed pattern). (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated window. Good analysis of 2025 monthly patterns from FRED. Noted volatility (3 increases, 3 decreases in last 6 months of 2025). (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 50% baseline, then applied +10-15% for momentum, −5% for fragility, +5% for broad-based improvement, −5-10% for TradingEconomics forecast. Net +5 to +10pp. Arrived at 59%. This was the highest outside view in the ensemble and the most bullish on recent momentum. The large upward adjustment from 50% reflects strong conviction in the recovery narrative. (3/4 — well-reasoned but perhaps over-weighted momentum)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 59%, the ensemble outlier on the high side
- Considered both directions but gave more weight to recovery signals
- The 59% feels somewhat high for what is essentially a coin-flip question with slight momentum

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Systematic and careful. Correctly identified that no source provides the Feb→Mar frequency. Noted FRED data's critical role. Correctly assessed each source's limitations. The key observation that "we cannot tether the outside-view frequency to a computed historical statistic" was the most honest assessment in the ensemble. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three well-defined candidates. Correctly identified the Feb→Mar class as best but acknowledged it couldn't be populated. Fell back to generic month-to-month direction (Reference Class B) with light adjustments. This is the most epistemically sound approach given data constraints. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Noted 33-day horizon and that one-step-ahead direction is hard to predict. Referenced 2025 volatility showing sign is not extremely persistent. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchored cleanly at 50% (generic month-to-month), applied only +1 to +3pp for mean reversion at depressed levels, arrived at 52%. This is the most conservative and defensible derivation in the ensemble — modest adjustment, clearly justified, with appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 52%, very close to the 50% prior
- Explicitly acknowledged competing considerations cancel out
- Most epistemically humble — did not over-claim knowledge it didn't have

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but complete. Correctly identified FRED as highest quality, dismissed irrelevant sources. Noted consensus forecasts are not structural models. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three clear candidates. Chose the Feb→Mar since 1980 class (45 data points) as primary. Strong justification for why this is the best match. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Noted 30-day horizon, correctly observed that noise dominates at one-month frequency. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Claimed "March > February in 22 of 45 years = 48.9%." This is a specific, precise figure that is not derivable from any provided source. The FRED data block only contains recent values and summary statistics, not a year-by-year Feb/Mar comparison table. This appears to be drawn from the model's pre-training knowledge. Applied a small −2pp adjustment for consensus tone, arriving at 48%. If the base rate is accurate (plausible for o3), this is an excellent derivation. But it cannot be verified. (3/4 — penalized for unverifiable source, despite plausible accuracy)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 48%, just below the claimed base rate
- Sound reasoning about noise vs. signal at monthly frequency
- The hallucinated base rate is the key concern — it happens to be plausible but sets a problematic precedent

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Systematic and concise. Correctly identified FRED as gold-standard. Noted agent report's limitations clearly. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidates, chose Feb→Mar since 1980. Same approach as S1-4 but with a different count (46 years vs 45). (3/4 — slight inconsistency with S1-4 raises questions about both)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Noted 30-day horizon. Brief but adequate. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Claimed "March > February in 25 of 46 years = 54%." This contradicts S1-4's "22 of 45 = 48.9%" despite both claiming to use the same reference class (Feb→Mar since 1980). The 6pp discrepancy (54% vs 48.9%) between two o3 instances computing the same statistic confirms these are hallucinated rather than reliably recalled. Applied adjustments for data uncertainty (±2pp), arrived at 55%. (2/4 — conflicting hallucinated base rate undermines credibility)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 55%, the second-highest outside view
- Contradiction with S1-4 on the same base rate computation is concerning
- If the true base rate is ~50-54%, then 55% is reasonable; if it's ~49%, then 55% is a slight overestimate

- **Score:** 12/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 43% | 12/16 | Thorough source analysis, identified recovery-from-trough reference class | Over-weighted 2025 Feb→Mar single data point, somewhat arbitrary adjustments |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 59% | 13/16 | Most detailed source evaluation, acknowledged FRED's limitation clearly | Highest prediction, possibly over-weighted momentum narrative |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 52% | 15/16 | Most epistemically sound, clean 50% anchor with minimal justified adjustment | Could have attempted more analysis of available data |
| S1-4 | o3 | 48% | 13/16 | Clear reference class selection, concise reasoning | Hallucinated specific base rate (22/45 = 48.9%) not in sources |
| S1-5 | o3 | 55% | 12/16 | Good source analysis, identified adjustment uncertainty | Contradictory hallucinated base rate (25/46 = 54%) vs S1-4 |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 43% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 48% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 59% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 52% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 55% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Thorough Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied. Strong evidence: Official data, Morningstar forecast (54.3), Fed Cook speech. Moderate: Conference Board divergence, Morgan Stanley mixed signals, auto sales. Weak: 2025 single-year pattern. Classification is mostly appropriate, though Morningstar's consensus forecast was elevated to "Strong" when it's really a single estimate. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 43% → Output: 32%, Δ = −11pp). Large downward shift driven primarily by Morningstar forecast (−8%), Fed headwinds (−5%), hard data (−4%), Conference Board (−3%), offset by momentum (+5%) and inflation expectations (+3%). The −11pp net adjustment is the largest in the ensemble and feels overcalibrated. Individual adjustment magnitudes are not well-justified — why −8% for Morningstar specifically? (2/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Halved → slightly higher confidence; doubled → more uncertainty with seasonal effects. Brief but adequate. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 6 elements completed. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (43%). Consistency check done ("32 out of 100 times"). Key evidence listed. Blind spot identified (genuine turning point scenario). Status quo assessed. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (downward) is consistent with the generally bearish new evidence
- However, the magnitude (−11pp) is excessive — the inside view evidence is incremental, not transformative
- Final 32% implies roughly 2:1 odds against March > February, which seems too confident given the near-coin-flip nature of monthly sentiment changes

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Key insight: correctly identified the "preliminary vs final" comparison structure as important — January showed a large upward revision (54.0 → 56.4), meaning February final could also revise up, raising the bar for March preliminary. This is the most sophisticated analytical point in the entire ensemble. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 48% → Output: 45%, Δ = −3pp). Detailed adjustments: base rate 48.9% from S1-4, −8pp from auto sales/Fed/K-shaped/Conference Board, +5pp from food deflation/momentum/stability. Net −3pp. This is a well-calibrated, moderate adjustment. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Thorough analysis. Halved → more weight on noise, nudge toward 50%. Doubled → more macro trends materialize, slight downside given Fed hawkishness. Clear reasoning. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 6 elements completed thoroughly. Strong paraphrase. Base rate stated (48%). Consistency check ("45 out of 100 times"). Five key evidence items listed. Blind spot: unexpected strength in February spending data. Status quo: favors "No" slightly. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction matches evidence direction (slightly bearish)
- Magnitude is modest and well-justified (−3pp)
- Final 45% is internally consistent with near-coin-flip assessment plus slight bearish lean
- The best-calibrated inside view in the ensemble

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Sophisticated analysis with a key insight about comparison structure (March preliminary vs February final). Correctly noted January's large upward revision creates risk that February final also revises up. Strong/Moderate/Weak categories well-applied. The "revision/threshold asymmetry" observation is a genuinely important analytical contribution. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 59% → Output: 52%, Δ = −7pp). Adjustments: revision asymmetry (−6 to −8pp), macro headwinds (−2 to −4pp), weather rebound potential (+1 to +3pp). Net: −7pp from 59%. This is a substantial but well-justified correction from the highest outside view. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halved → closer to 50/50, doubled → drift below 50%. Reasoning about revision mechanics under shorter timeframe is insightful. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (59%). Consistency check ("52 out of 100 cases"). Key evidence: January prelim→final revision, Feb forecasts, inflation/cost pressure, transitory weakness. Blind spot: inflation-relief signal or strong jobs surprise. Status quo: staying near 50/50 is prudent. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Large update from 59% → 52% is directionally correct and appropriate in magnitude
- Final 52% represents a sensible near-coinflip with slight upward lean
- The preliminary-vs-final comparison insight is the most novel analytical contribution in the ensemble

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured. Strong evidence: none (no hard Feb/Mar data yet — appropriate acknowledgment). Moderate: consensus forecasts, Conference Board crash, auto/ISM weakness, stock market/food inflation support. Weak: mixed indicators. Appropriately conservative weighting given data limitations. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 52% → Output: 48%, Δ = −4pp). Adjustments: +3pp for likely lower February bar (if February drops, March only needs modest gain), −5pp for momentum concerns/affordability, −2pp for final revision pattern. Net: −4pp. Clear, well-justified arithmetic. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but insightful. Halved → trim volatility, lean "No." Doubled → widen error bars, drift back toward 50%. Good reasoning. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Abridged but complete. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (52%). Consistency check ("48 times out of 100"). Key evidence listed. Blind spot: stock rally + lower CPI. Status quo: drifting lower, modest lean to continuation. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (slightly bearish) is consistent with evidence
- Magnitude (−4pp) is modest and well-calibrated
- Final 48% is very close to the base rate, reflecting appropriate uncertainty
- Good balance between competing factors

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good categorization. Strong ↓: Conference Board plunge (10 pts). Moderate ↓: consensus expects Feb drop, Fed/labor concerns. Moderate ↑: stock market highs, food inflation. Weak: mixed ISM/auto/survey data. The Conference Board plunge is perhaps over-weighted as "strong" given it's a different survey with limited predictive power for Michigan. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 55% → Output: 45%, Δ = −10pp). Adjustments: −7pp for lower Feb level + Conference Board + weaker high-frequency data, +3pp for equity rally and food inflation. Net: −10pp. This is a large adjustment from the 55% base but lands in a reasonable range. The magnitude is somewhat driven by the aggressive Conference Board weighting. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief. Halved → widen toward 50/50. Doubled → push further down to high-30s. Adequate but less detailed than other outputs. (2/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Base rate 54%. Consistency check ("45 out of 100 times"). Key evidence listed. Blind spot: unexpected positive payroll/CPI print. Status quo acknowledged. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction is correct (bearish)
- Magnitude (−10pp) is large but not unreasonable given the shift from an already-high outside view
- Final 45% is internally consistent
- Provided confidence interval (30-60% as 80% CI) — a nice calibration touch unique in the ensemble

- **Score:** 11/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 43% | 32% | −11pp | 12/16 | Partial — direction correct but magnitude excessive |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 48% | 45% | −3pp | 15/16 | Yes — well-calibrated modest adjustment |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 59% | 52% | −7pp | 14/16 | Yes — large but justified correction from high base |
| S2-4 | o3 | 52% | 48% | −4pp | 13/16 | Yes — modest, well-reasoned |
| S2-5 | o3 | 55% | 45% | −10pp | 11/16 | Partial — direction correct, magnitude somewhat large |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):** S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3's 48%) engaged meaningfully — incorporated the 48.9% base rate from S1-4 and built its own detailed adjustment framework around it. S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet 4.5's 59%) provided the most interesting cross-model interaction — the high outside view (59%) was substantially corrected downward to 52%, with the GPT-5.2 model bringing its own analytical insight about preliminary-vs-final comparison mechanics. S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's 52%) showed the cleanest incremental update, making a modest −4pp adjustment.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 with own 43%) made the largest absolute shift (−11pp), suggesting self-reinforcement of bearish tendencies. S2-5 (o3 with own 55%) also made a large shift (−10pp), but this is partially because the outside view was the second-highest in the ensemble.

- **Diversity impact:** Cross-pollination was moderately effective. Despite starting with a 16pp spread in outside views (43-59%), the inside views converged to a tighter 20pp range (32-52%), but the convergence was asymmetric — all forecasters moved bearish, with S2-1 pulling the ensemble down as an outlier. The cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) landed in a tight 45-52% band (7pp spread), while same-model instances diverged more (S2-1 at 32%, S2-5 at 45%).

- **Key observation:** Cross-pollination successfully prevented the two highest outside views (59% and 55%) from persisting into final predictions. The mechanism worked as designed — diverse model perspectives challenged overly-bullish or overly-bearish positions.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All 5 instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: March 2026 preliminary > February 2026 final, per University of Michigan website.
- All correctly identified the forecast timeframe (~33 days, with February final ~Feb 20 and March preliminary ~Mar 6-10).
- All correctly assessed the current state: January 2026 final at 56.4, December 2025 at 52.9, recent two-month recovery from November 2025 trough.
- S2-2 and S2-3 added the important nuance about preliminary vs. final comparison asymmetry — a sophisticated understanding that enhanced their analysis.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. January 2026 final sentiment = 56.4 (revised up from preliminary 54.0), December 2025 = 52.9
2. The 2025 trend showed persistent decline from 71.7 (Jan) to 51.0 (Nov) before modest recovery
3. Morningstar consensus for February 2026 preliminary = 54.3 (suggesting decline from January)
4. TradingEconomics Q1 2026 forecast = 54.0 (suggesting weakness)
5. FRED UMCSENT historical data confirmed via the new FRED integration tool

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Hallucinated base rate | Claims "22 of 45 years (48.9%)" for March > February since 1980. Not in any provided source. | Medium — plausible but unverifiable |
| S1-5 | Contradictory hallucinated base rate | Claims "25 of 46 years (54%)" for the same statistic. Contradicts S1-4. | Medium — undermines both o3 base rates |
| S1-2 | Minor data error | Described recent monthly increases as "+1.9, +1.5, +2.4" but Nov→Dec was +1.9 and Dec→Jan was +3.5 (not three separate increases matching those figures) | Low — didn't materially affect conclusion |
| S2-2 | Morningstar baseline confusion | Noted Morningstar forecast (54.3) as "citing 56.4 as December baseline (appears to confuse December vs January)" — but this may have been correct at time of publication | Low |

### Hallucinations

Two o3 instances (S1-4 and S1-5) produced specific historical base rates for Feb→Mar changes that were not derivable from any provided source material. S1-4 claimed 22/45 = 48.9% and S1-5 claimed 25/46 = 54%. The 6pp discrepancy between two instances of the same model computing the same statistic confirms these are hallucinated from pre-training knowledge rather than computed from the FRED data or other provided sources. While one or both may be approximately correct, they cannot be verified and the contradiction is concerning. No other hallucinations were detected.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **FRED integration worked excellently** — the UMCSENT series was correctly identified and retrieved, providing authoritative historical data that all 5 forecasters leveraged. This validates the FRED tool design.
2. **Research breadth was strong** — the combination of FRED data, Google search results, agentic search, and AskNews produced a comprehensive information set covering official data, consensus forecasts, Fed commentary, sector data, and survey results.
3. **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5) and S2-3 (GPT-5.2) produced exceptionally well-calibrated inside views** — both identified the preliminary-vs-final comparison asymmetry, applied moderate adjustments, and landed on defensible 45-52% predictions. S2-2's 15/16 score was the highest in the ensemble.
4. **Cross-pollination functioned as designed** — high outside views were appropriately corrected downward by inside view evidence, and cross-model instances showed more convergence than same-model instances.
5. **All forecasters correctly identified and dismissed irrelevant sources** (Hawesko wine company, incomplete Kiplinger).

### Weaknesses
1. **Missing critical base rate** — the Feb→Mar historical frequency was the single most important outside-view statistic, and the research pipeline failed to provide it. The Agent search couldn't retrieve it, and FRED's one-month delay meant the tool provided recent values but not the full year-by-year comparison. Two o3 instances filled the gap with hallucinated statistics that contradicted each other.
2. **S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5) overcorrected** — the −11pp shift from 43% to 32% was the largest adjustment in the ensemble and pulled the final aggregation down. The 32% prediction implies 2:1 odds against a month-over-month increase, which seems overconfident for what is essentially a near-coin-flip event.
3. **Ensemble spread of 20pp (32-52%) is substantial** — driven primarily by S2-1's outlier low prediction. Without S2-1, the remaining four predictions (45%, 52%, 48%, 45%) have only a 7pp spread, suggesting S2-1's overcorrection was the primary source of ensemble disagreement.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The forecast demonstrates strong research integration (especially the novel FRED tool), good analytical depth from most forecasters, and effective cross-pollination. The main deductions are: (1) S2-1's overcorrection pulling the aggregate below what the evidence supports, (2) the contradictory hallucinated base rates from two o3 instances, and (3) the research pipeline's failure to surface the key Feb→Mar historical frequency. Despite these issues, the final 44.4% prediction is reasonable for a near-coin-flip question with slight bearish indicators.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
1. **FRED tool enhancement**: Consider adding a computed "month-to-month direction frequency" feature that automatically calculates how often month M+1 > month M in a given series. This would have directly answered the key base rate question.
2. **Agent search resilience**: The Agent was correctly tasked with computing the Feb→Mar base rate but failed. Consider providing the Agent with direct access to the FRED API (rather than web scraping) for programmatic data retrieval.
3. **Source filtering**: Add a relevance filter to exclude clearly irrelevant sources (e.g., the German wine company article) before they reach forecasters, saving context window space.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
1. **Inside view adjustment guardrails**: Consider adding guidance in the inside view prompt that adjustments from the outside view should be proportionate to the evidence quality. A −11pp shift (S2-1) from incremental consensus forecasts feels disproportionate.
2. **Hallucination awareness**: When models produce specific statistics not traceable to provided sources, the pipeline could benefit from a verification step — especially for base rates which anchor the entire forecast.
3. **Preliminary vs. final asymmetry**: The S2-2 and S2-3 insight about comparing preliminary to final readings should be surfaced earlier, perhaps in the question analysis phase. This comparison structure materially affects the forecast.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-1)**: Tendency toward large inside-view corrections. The model may benefit from stronger anchoring to the outside view base rate.
- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-2)**: Excellent calibration. The most analytically sophisticated output in the ensemble with its food deflation and base rate framework.
- **GPT-5.2 (S2-3)**: Strong epistemic humility in outside view; insightful preliminary-vs-final analysis in inside view. Consistently well-calibrated.
- **o3 (S1-4, S1-5)**: Both produced useful analyses but hallucinated contradictory base rates. The model's tendency to fill knowledge gaps with pre-training data rather than acknowledging uncertainty is a concern. S2-4's inside view was well-calibrated; S2-5's was slightly aggressive.

### FRED Integration Notes (First Test)
- **FRED query triggered:** `UMCSENT (FRED)` — correctly identified by the o3 query generator
- **Data returned:** Full UMCSENT series with monthly values (2024-01 through 2025-12), summary statistics (1yr/5yr/10yr/all-time mean/min/max), recent changes, and year-over-year comparison
- **Forecaster utilization:** All 5 outside-view forecasters referenced FRED data as a primary source
- **Complementarity with Agent:** The Agent search attempted to retrieve FRED CSV data via web crawling but failed; the FRED API tool delivered the data directly, demonstrating the value of the integration
- **Limitation identified:** FRED's one-month publication delay means the most recent value was December 2025, not January 2026. For questions requiring the very latest data point, other sources (Investing.com, direct Michigan releases) remain necessary supplements
