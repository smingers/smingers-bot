# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

**Complete this section FIRST after reading all artifacts. List the most significant problems that affected forecast quality.**

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent 3 extraction failure | Critical | S2-3 (o3-mini) | Percentile format used "%" symbols which caused extraction to fail entirely. Agent 3's prediction was excluded from aggregation. |
| Agent 5 extreme dovish outlier | High | S1-5 / S2-5 | Agent 5 (o3) predicted significantly lower rates than all others (median ~9.75% vs 10.0-10.5%), creating ensemble skew despite only having 4/5 valid CDFs |
| Current search irrelevant results | Medium | Research | Current search returned mostly US Fed, India RBI, Poland, and Germany articles - almost no Pakistan-specific forecasts for May 2026 |
| Missing specific rate path forecasts | Medium | Research | No economist forecasts for SBP rate specifically on May 1, 2026 were found in any search results |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (Agent 3's exclusion reduced ensemble diversity)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (Agent 5's outlier position skewed final distribution)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (research gaps partially compensated by strong primary source coverage)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "State Bank of Pakistan policy rate history 2018 2025" (Google)
2. "SBP monetary policy statement December 2025" (Google News)
3. "Provide timeline of SBP policy rate changes, CPI inflation and IMF program milestones 2022-2026; list exact dates and percentages" (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. "SBP policy rate January 2026" (Google)
2. "Pakistan interest rate expectations 2026" (Google News)
3. "Gather January 2026 MPS details and economists' forecasts for SBP cuts into May 2026" (Assistant)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2018-2025 rate history, IMF milestones | January 2026 MPS, forward expectations |
| Content type | Official rate decisions, macroeconomic timeline | Market surveys, analyst forecasts, recent MPC decision |
| Unique contribution | Establishes easing cycle trajectory (22%→10.5%), IMF program context | Captures January 26 hawkish surprise (hold vs expected cut) |

**Analysis:**
- Queries were appropriately discrete - historical focused on establishing the rate trajectory and reference class, current focused on the latest MPC decision and forward expectations.
- Historical queries successfully surfaced the rate decline from 22% (June 2023) to 10.5% (January 2026) - a 1,150bp easing cycle.
- Current queries captured the critical January 26, 2026 decision to hold at 10.5% despite market expectations for a 50-75bp cut.
- **Critical gap:** Current search returned primarily irrelevant content (US Fed, India RBI, Poland RPP, Germany) rather than Pakistan-specific analyst forecasts for May 2026. Only the direct Pakistani news sources (Dawn, Tribune, Brecorder) provided decision-relevant information.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs remained appropriately factual. The sources reported:
- Current rate: 10.5%
- Market expectations: 50-100bp cut expected (but not realized)
- SBP forward guidance: inflation to stay within 5-7% target
- Industry demands: FPCCI wanted 350bp cut to 7% (advocacy, not prediction)

No inappropriate probability estimates were included in research summaries. The Agent Report acknowledged data gaps rather than fabricating forecasts.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  1. Current rate of 10.5% confirmed by multiple Pakistani sources (Dawn, Tribune, Brecorder, Dunya News)
  2. January 26 hawkish surprise - SBP held despite 80%+ market expectation for cuts
  3. Governor Jameel Ahmad's guidance: real rate "adequately positive," inflation may "temporarily exceed 7%"
  4. Inflation at 5.6% headline, 7.4% core
  5. FX reserves at $16.1bn, trending to $18bn by June 2026
  6. Next MPC meeting: March 9, 2026

- **Critical information missed:**
  1. No economist forecasts specifically for May 2026 SBP rate
  2. No IMF program review schedule details for Q1-Q2 2026
  3. Current search retrieved mostly irrelevant international content

- **Source quality:** High for Pakistani news sources; CEIC data showed outdated 12% figure (November 2025) creating minor confusion

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** 4/4 - Excellent. Evaluated each source individually, noted CEIC discrepancy (12% vs 10.5%), identified Dawn as highly credible, flagged World Bank data as too old, appropriately weighted SBP Governor's statements.

- **Reference Class Selection:** 4/4 - Identified three reference classes: (1) Pakistan's post-crisis easing cycles (2008-2009, 2019-2020), (2) EM central banks with IMF programs, (3) Pakistan's 2024-2026 easing cycle. Correctly selected (3) as most suitable with clear justification.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** 4/4 - Correctly identified 93 days, 2 MPC meetings (March 9 + late April), examined historical 50bp increment patterns, analyzed cycle maturity.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** 3/4 - Derived discrete probabilities (no cuts 20-25%, one cut 50%, two cuts 20%, >100bp <5%) but could have been more explicit about mathematical derivation from reference class.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Provided full percentile distribution (10th: 9.5%, 90th: 11.0%)
- Distribution shape appropriate - concentrated around 10.0-10.5% with asymmetric tails
- Anchored appropriately on current 10.5% rate

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** 4/4 - Thorough evaluation including quality ratings. Correctly identified resolution of CEIC discrepancy. Distinguished fact from opinion clearly.

- **Reference Class Selection:** 3/4 - Identified four classes but selection justification was slightly less rigorous than Agent 1. Chose "Pakistani rate cycle 2023-2026" appropriately.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** 4/4 - Correctly identified 93 days, 2 meetings. Provided scenario analysis table with probability estimates. Good analysis of how timeframe affects distribution.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** 4/4 - Clear scenario probabilities: hold 25%, one cut 35%, two cuts 20%, larger cuts 10%, rate increase 5%, aggressive cuts 5%. Well-justified.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Percentiles well-calibrated (10th: 9.0%, 90th: 11.0%)
- Distribution slightly wider than Agent 1, reflecting more uncertainty about tail scenarios
- Appropriate consideration of both dovish and hawkish scenarios

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (o3-mini)

- **Source Analysis:** 3/4 - Good but more concise than Sonnet outputs. Covered key sources but with less depth on quality evaluation.

- **Reference Class Selection:** 3/4 - Identified appropriate classes (recent SBP history, EM with IMF programs, stable inflation environments) but analysis was shorter and less rigorous.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** 3/4 - Correctly identified 93 days and meeting schedule. Analysis of historical patterns present but less detailed.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** 3/4 - Reasonable distribution centered on 10.5% with ±0.5pp uncertainty. Narrower range than other agents (10.0-10.9% for 10th-90th).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Very tight distribution (10th: 10.0%, 90th: 10.9%)
- May be overconfident given 93-day horizon
- Appropriately anchored on status quo

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** 4/4 - Excellent systematic evaluation. Clear quality ratings (high/medium/low). Correctly prioritized Dawn and official sources.

- **Reference Class Selection:** 4/4 - Identified three classes and selected class (b) "three-month windows when headline CPI is inside 5-7% band and real rate ≥300bp" with quantitative justification (22 historical windows, median move -50bp).

- **Timeframe Analysis:** 4/4 - Comprehensive. Analyzed MPC meeting frequency, historical per-meeting outcomes (no change 45%, ±50bp 40%, ≥±75bp 15%).

- **Base Rate Derivation:** 4/4 - Well-structured probabilities: two cuts 20%, one cut 40%, hold 30%, one hike 8%, tails 2%. Clear grid-point approach (0.5% increments).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Wider distribution (10th: 9.0%, 90th: 11.5%)
- Explicitly addresses tail risks including rate hikes
- Mathematically rigorous approach

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** 4/4 - Systematic evaluation with quality ratings. Correctly identified key facts and cross-checked figures.

- **Reference Class Selection:** 4/4 - Excellent. Used "SBP easing cycles after a peak" (1998, 2009, 2019, 2023) with specific historical data: median three-month move ≈-100bp.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** 4/4 - Correctly identified 93 days and 2 MPC meetings. Clear analysis of how horizon affects distribution.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** 3/4 - Distribution noticeably more dovish than other agents (10th: 8.7%, 90th: 10.4%). The -100bp median from reference class may be overweighted given January's hawkish surprise.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution centered lower (~9.4-9.9% median) than peers
- Creates outlier effect in ensemble
- Reference class application reasonable but may not fully account for late-cycle dynamics

- **Score:** 15/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Median) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~10.0-10.5% | 15/16 | Comprehensive source analysis, well-justified reference class | Base rate derivation slightly implicit |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~10.0% | 15/16 | Clear scenario table with probabilities | Reference class justification slightly less rigorous |
| S1-3 | o3-mini | ~10.4-10.5% | 12/16 | Efficient, appropriately anchored | Narrow range may be overconfident |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~10.0-10.5% | 16/16 | Quantitative reference class, grid-point approach | None significant |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~9.4-9.9% | 15/16 | Strong historical reference class analysis | Dovish outlier - may overweight historical easing pattern |

---

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Median |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 10.0-10.5% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 10.0-10.5% |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 10.0% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (o3-mini) | 10.4-10.5% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 9.4-9.9% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** 4/4 - Excellent. Clearly categorized evidence as Strong (January hawkish surprise, Governor guidance, cycle maturity), Moderate (time horizon, IMF constraints, FX reserve improvement), Weak (industry advocacy, core vs headline divergence).

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~10.25% (median) → Output: ~10.25% (median), Δ = 0. Justified by January hawkish surprise increasing hold probability from 25% to 35-40%.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 4/4 - Addressed timeframe changes: halved would increase hold probability, doubled would widen lower tail.

- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 - Complete with target variable, outside view anchor, consistency check (median 10.25%, mean 10.2%), key evidence list, blind spot identified (IMF review encouraging faster easing).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution appropriately tightened from S1-1
- 10-90 range of 75bp (9.75-10.5%) reflects reduced uncertainty
- Both central estimate AND range updated sensibly

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** 4/4 - Strong/Moderate/Weak framework properly applied. January pause, core inflation elevation, meeting calendar uncertainty all weighted.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~10.0-10.5% → Output: ~10.0-10.25% (median), Δ = small hawkish shift. Increased hold probability from 30% to 45%.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 3/4 - Mentioned how halving/doubling affects distribution but less detailed than S2-1.

- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 - Complete. Identified blind spot: rupee crisis forcing emergency hike.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Well-calibrated distribution (10th: 9.5%, 90th: 10.5%)
- CDF monotonic and smooth
- Appropriate concentration of probability in 10.0-10.5% range

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (o3-mini): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** 4/4 - Thorough categorization. Strong: official hold, historical easing trajectory. Moderate: market surveys, cut expectations. Weak: anecdotal calls for cuts.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~10.0% → Output: ~10.0% (median), Δ = minimal shift. One 50bp cut remains base case (35%), hold probability 25%.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 4/4 - Clear analysis of how halving/doubling horizon affects distribution.

- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 - Complete with all required elements.

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Despite reasonable analysis, the output used "%" symbols in percentile values (e.g., "Percentile 1: 8.5%"), causing extraction failure. Agent 3's CDF was NOT included in aggregation.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution would have been reasonable (10th: 9.0%, 90th: 11.0%)
- Extraction failure means this agent contributed nothing to final forecast
- This is a pipeline bug, not an analysis quality issue

- **Score:** 15/16 (analysis quality) but **0/16 effective contribution**

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** 4/4 - Clear Strong/Moderate/Weak categorization. Appropriately weighted January hold as strongest evidence.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~10.5% (from o3-mini's narrow distribution) → Output: ~10.3% (median), Δ = -0.2pp. Reflects slight dovish adjustment while maintaining conservative stance.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 4/4 - Excellent. Analyzed one-meeting vs two-meeting scenarios explicitly.

- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 - Complete. Blind spot: sudden rupee crisis.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Very tight, conservative distribution (10th: 9.75%, 90th: 10.65%)
- 90bp spread is narrow but justified given late-cycle dynamics
- Modal outcome at 10.5% (hold) with 35% probability

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** 4/4 - Good categorization. Strong: easing stance established, high real rate. Moderate: SBP guidance, improving reserves, consensus mis-timed January.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~9.75% → Output: ~9.75% (median), Δ = 0. Maintained dovish stance despite receiving same current news as other agents.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 3/4 - Mentioned but less detailed than peers.

- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 - Complete. Blind spot: rupee sell-off forcing emergency hike.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution remains notably dovish (10th: 8.9%, 90th: 10.6%)
- Creates outlier effect - median ~1pp below other agents
- May be under-weighting January hawkish surprise

- **Score:** 15/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final Median | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~10.25% | ~10.25% | 0 | 16/16 | Yes - appropriately weighted January surprise |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~10.25% | ~10.0% | -0.25 | 15/16 | Yes - slight dovish adjustment reasonable |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | ~10.0% | FAILED | N/A | 0/16* | N/A - extraction failure |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~10.5% | ~10.3% | -0.2 | 16/16 | Yes - conservative with slight dovish tilt |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~9.75% | ~9.75% | 0 | 15/16 | Partial - may under-weight hawkish surprise |

*Agent 3 scored 15/16 for analysis quality but 0/16 effective contribution due to extraction failure.

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**
- **S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's S1-4):** Yes. Engaged thoroughly with the quantitative reference class approach from o3 and integrated it with current news analysis.
- **S2-3 (o3-mini receiving Sonnet's S1-2):** Analysis engaged well but extraction failure negated contribution.
- **S2-4 (o3 receiving o3-mini's S1-3):** Yes. Adjusted the narrow o3-mini distribution slightly dovish while maintaining conservative stance.

**Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**
- No significant over/under-weighting observed. Cross-pollinated inputs were appropriately integrated.

**Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**
- **S2-1 (Sonnet→Sonnet):** Maintained similar distribution with minor tightening.
- **S2-5 (o3→o3):** Maintained dovish stance from S1-5, potentially under-adapting to hawkish current news.
- Same-model instances showed slightly less adjustment than cross-model, as expected.

**Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**
- Cross-pollination **increased diversity** by having o3 receive o3-mini's narrower distribution (S2-4) and Sonnet receive o3's wider distribution (S2-2), creating differentiated outputs.
- However, Agent 5's self-pollination preserved the dovish outlier without cross-model correction.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **Did all instances correctly understand the resolution criteria?** Yes. All agents correctly identified the target as SBP policy rate effective at 11:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2026.
- **Did they accurately identify the forecast timeframe?** Yes. All correctly stated 93 days with 2 MPC meetings.
- **Did they correctly assess the current status/state of affairs?** Yes. All identified current rate at 10.5% following January 26, 2026 hold.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Current policy rate: 10.5% (January 26, 2026)
2. Previous cut: 50bp on December 15, 2025 (from 11.0%)
3. Headline inflation: 5.6%, Core inflation: 7.4%
4. FX reserves: $16.1bn, trending to $18bn by June 2026
5. Next MPC meeting: March 9, 2026
6. January decision surprised markets (majority expected 50-75bp cut)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-2 | CEIC data discrepancy | Noted 12% rate in November 2025 from CEIC vs 10.5% in January 2026 - correctly identified as outdated/different definition | Low - flagged and dismissed |
| S1-5 | Reference class dating | Stated 22% peak in "Sep 2023" but other agents correctly cited June 2023 | Low - minor date error, correct rate |

### Hallucinations

No significant hallucinations detected. All key facts were corroborated across multiple Pakistani news sources. The Agent Report acknowledged data gaps rather than fabricating information.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong primary source coverage** - Multiple Pakistani news sources (Dawn, Tribune, Brecorder) provided consistent, high-quality information about the January 26 MPC decision.
2. **Appropriate reference class selection** - Most agents identified relevant historical patterns (Pakistan's easing cycles) and quantified base rates.
3. **Good calibration awareness** - All agents addressed the January hawkish surprise and appropriately updated their distributions.
4. **Comprehensive checklists** - Step 2 outputs included proper calibration checklists with blind spot identification.

### Weaknesses
1. **Agent 3 extraction failure** - Critical pipeline bug excluded one agent's contribution due to "%" symbols in percentile output.
2. **Agent 5 dovish outlier** - o3's self-pollinated instance maintained a distribution ~1pp lower than peers, skewing the ensemble.
3. **Poor current search relevance** - AskNews returned almost entirely irrelevant international content (US Fed, India RBI, Poland, Germany).
4. **Missing forward-looking analyst forecasts** - No economist projections specifically for May 2026 SBP rate were surfaced.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| **B** | **Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling** |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

Rationale: Strong primary source analysis and appropriate reference class reasoning, compromised by Agent 3 extraction failure (reducing ensemble to 4 agents) and Agent 5's dovish outlier. The core forecast methodology is sound but pipeline issues and one outlier agent affect reliability.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
1. **Add Pakistan-specific news sources to current search** - Arif Habib, Topline Securities, JS Global research reports would provide actual rate forecasts.
2. **Include SBP official website scraping** - Direct access to Monetary Policy Statements would provide authoritative forward guidance.
3. **Filter AskNews by geography** - Current search should restrict to Pakistan-focused content rather than global central bank coverage.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
1. **FIX CRITICAL: Standardize percentile output format** - Agent 3 failed extraction due to "%" symbols. Enforce strict format validation or strip percentage symbols during extraction.
2. **Add format reminder in prompts** - Explicitly state "Do not include % symbols in percentile values" in numeric prompts.
3. **Outlier detection in aggregation** - Consider flagging or down-weighting agents whose distributions are >1 standard deviation from ensemble mean.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **o3-mini:** Output format issue needs prompt-level correction. Analysis quality was good but formatting caused complete failure.
- **o3 (Agent 5):** May benefit from stronger anchoring on current-news hawkish signals rather than historical reference class median. The -100bp historical median may not apply to late-cycle dynamics.
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Performed well across both instances with appropriate calibration and evidence weighting.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range | Yes | Agent 5 median ~9.75% vs Agent 4 median ~10.3% = 0.55pp on 20pp range (2.75%) |
| Update direction errors | No | All agents appropriately weighted hawkish January surprise |
| Factual errors present | Yes | Minor - CEIC data discrepancy (correctly flagged), reference class date error |
| Hallucinations detected | No | All facts corroborated |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Worked for S2-2, S2-4; S2-3 failed extraction; S2-5 may have under-adapted |
| Critical info missed in research | Yes | No Pakistan-specific analyst forecasts for May 2026 |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All derivations mathematically sound |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | Agent 5 (S2-5) median ~1pp below ensemble mean |
