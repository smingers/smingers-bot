# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent 1 extraction failure | Critical | Extraction | Agent 1's extracted percentiles all collapsed to ~10.75 despite reasoning showing 9.25-10.75 range |
| S1-3 (o3-mini) median above current rate | Medium | S1-3 | Outside view median at 10.75% implies expected HIKE despite ongoing easing cycle |
| Current search irrelevant results | Medium | Research | AskNews current search returned mostly non-Pakistan articles (Russia, Brazil, India, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Philippines) |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. State Bank of Pakistan policy rate history (Google)
2. SBP monetary policy rate cut 2025 (Google News)
3. Provide timeline of SBP policy rate changes 2020-2026, inflation trends, IMF programme details; emphasize guidance in Jan 2026 statement (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Pakistan policy rate forecast 2026 (Google)
2. SBP interest rate outlook (Google News)
3. Gather recent reports on SBP projected policy rate path to 2026, IMF conditions, and inflation expectations. (Assistant)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2020-2026 timeline, past rate decisions | 2026 forward outlook, projections |
| Content type | Data series, MPS chronology, IMF program history | Forecasts, analyst opinions, macro projections |
| Unique contribution | Base rate establishment, cycle patterns | Forward guidance interpretation, market expectations |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are reasonably discrete with historical focusing on establishing the rate path and current focusing on forward projections
- Historical queries successfully targeted base rate establishment with comprehensive timeline returned
- Current queries suffered from poor AskNews results - most articles were about other countries (Russia, Brazil, Philippines, India, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Argentina)
- Critical gap: No direct query for the January 26, 2026 MPC decision outcome (though it was captured via other sources)

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The query generation outputs include some analysis text to orient the search, but this is acceptable context-setting rather than premature forecasting. The actual probability assignments happen appropriately in the Step 1 forecasting phase.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current rate: 10.50% (confirmed from Jan 26, 2026 hold decision)
  - Complete rate timeline 2020-2026 including all easing cycle cuts
  - January 26 hold decision despite 80%+ market expectations for cut
  - SBP forward guidance: "real policy rate adequately positive"
  - IMF program constraints, third review in May 2026
  - Inflation at 5.6% (Dec 2025), core at 7.4%
  - CRR cut of 100bp (liquidity easing without rate cut)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - No analyst rate forecasts from major institutions specific to May 2026
  - Limited coverage of MPC meeting schedule (agents had to estimate)

- **Source quality:** High - Agent report was comprehensive and well-sourced with primary SBP documents

---

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematically evaluated each source (CEIC, TradingView, SBP, Aaj TV, Tribune, Agent Report) with quality ratings and identified factual vs. opinion content. Correctly flagged TradingView as low relevance due to age and inconsistencies.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Identified three classes (IMF program, EM central banks, SBP easing cycles) and correctly chose "Pakistani policy rate during current IMF program with disinflation context" as most suitable.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 91-day window, properly estimated 1-2 MPC meetings, analyzed historical easing pace showing deceleration pattern.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Well-structured scenario analysis with probabilities (Base 60%, Moderate 25%, Status Quo 10%, Aggressive 5%). Distribution appropriately centered around 10.0-10.5%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of 9.75% median with 10.50% P10 and 9.25% P90
- Distribution shape shows right skew (toward higher rates) reflecting forward guidance
- 125bp 80% confidence interval reasonable for 3-month EM policy uncertainty

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of 7 sources with quality assessments. Correctly identified Agent Report as highest quality.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified three classes but chose "current easing cycle combined with IMF program constraints" which is slightly less crisp than Output 1.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 91-day window, properly noted 1-2 meetings expected.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Reasonable scenarios but distribution is INVERTED from Output 1 - median at 10.50% implies most likely outcome is NO cut or slight HIKE, which seems inconsistent with ongoing easing cycle.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P10: 9.25%, P60: 10.50%, P90: 11.00%
- Distribution oddly right-skewed (toward higher rates) with 60th percentile at current rate
- This implies expected value ABOVE current rate despite easing cycle - questionable

- **Score:** 11/16 (deducted for counterintuitive distribution direction)

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (o3-mini)

- **Source Analysis:** Adequate but less detailed. Correctly identified key sources and noted reliability issues.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good choice of "recent disinflation cycle" as reference class.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 95-day window and expected modest moves.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Distribution centered ABOVE current rate (P40=10.5%, P60=10.75%, P80=11.0%) - this is problematic as it implies the MOST LIKELY scenario is a rate HIKE despite all evidence pointing to continued easing cycle.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Median ~10.50% implies no change is central expectation
- P90 at 11.25% implies significant probability of HIKE
- Distribution shape inconsistent with easing cycle narrative in the text

- **Score:** 9/16 (significant deduction for inverted distribution logic)

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematic evaluation with explicit reliability ratings. Correctly treated user blog content with skepticism.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Outstanding. Built empirical reference class from 5 EM cases under IMF programs, derived -75bp median with 0/-150bp IQR - this is the most rigorous approach.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 92-day analysis, noted 88% of single-meeting changes were -150bp or smaller.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear discrete probability assignment converted to percentiles: P10=9.0%, P60=10.1%, P90=10.8%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution appropriately skewed toward cuts
- Median ~10.0% (implied 50bp cut) aligns with "one 50bp cut most likely" narrative
- Good balance between easing bias and recent hold signal

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Very thorough with 7 sources evaluated. Correctly identified primary vs secondary sources.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent. Built Pakistan-specific reference class from 171 monthly observations (2009-2025), further filtered to 11 episodes matching current conditions (CPI 4-8%, real rate ≥3%).
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct analysis, noted two meetings can affect outcome.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear empirical base (45% no-change, 45% cut, 9% hike) applied to current 10.5%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P10=9.25%, P60=10.50%, P90=12.00%
- Wide right tail (P90 at 12.0%) may be excessive but acknowledges shock risk
- Median aligned with current rate reflects the hold signal

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Median) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 9.75% | 14/16 | Structured scenario analysis | None significant |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 10.50% | 11/16 | Thorough source analysis | Distribution implies hike |
| S1-3 | o3-mini | 10.50% | 9/16 | Concise | Inverted distribution logic |
| S1-4 | o3 | 10.0% | 15/16 | Rigorous empirical reference class | Slightly narrow tails |
| S1-5 | o3 | 10.25% | 14/16 | Best historical analysis | Wide right tail |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Median |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5) | 9.75% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 10.0% |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 10.50% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (o3-mini) | 10.50% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3) | 10.25% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly identified Jan 26 hold as strong evidence of terminal rate proximity.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 9.75% median → Output: 9.75% median, Δ = 0. Maintained outside view, which is appropriate given new evidence confirms prior assessment.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed explicitly - halving would shift right (10.0-10.25%), doubling would shift left (9.25-9.5%).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and thoughtful. Identified blind spot as "unexpected external shock."

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** The extracted JSON shows ALL percentiles collapsed to ~10.75%, despite the markdown reasoning clearly showing a distribution from 8.75% (P99) to 10.75% (P1). This is an extraction failure that corrupts the final aggregation.

- **Score:** 14/16 (reasoning quality), but extraction failure makes this output ineffective

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong. Correctly identified the January hawkish surprise as key evidence.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 10.0% median (from S1-4) → Output: 10.25% median, Δ = +0.25%. Appropriate upward shift given January hold.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis of single-meeting constraint before resolution.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Identified blind spot as sharp inflation decline allowing 100bp cut.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution shows bimodal character with 50% on 10.5%, 40% on 10.0%
- Appropriately wide tails (P1=8.5%, P99=11.5%)
- Update direction matches evidence (hold → higher probability of status quo)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (o3-mini): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Adequate. Referenced SBP guidance and historical patterns.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 10.50% median (from S1-2) → Output: 10.25% median, Δ = -0.25%. Appropriate slight downward shift toward easing.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but present - noted half/double horizon effects.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Good blind-spot identification (inflation shock).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution centered at 10.25% with 9.5%-11.0% 90% CI
- Reasonable given hawkish input from S1-2
- Successfully corrected some of S1-2's upward bias

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Very good. Explicitly graded evidence as strong/moderate/weak.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 10.50% median (from S1-3) → Output: 10.25% median, Δ = -0.25%. Appropriate downward correction.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis noting two meetings remain.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and thorough.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Wide distribution (P1=8.5%, P99=12.0%) appropriate for emerging market
- Median 10.25% aligns with "one small cut most likely" narrative
- Successfully corrected S1-3's inverted distribution

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent systematic grading of all evidence.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 10.25% median (from S1-5) → Output: 10.0% median, Δ = -0.25%. Slight easing bias.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicit analysis of meeting count impact.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with specific blind-spot (rupee slide + oil spike).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Discrete probability mass clearly laid out (40% at 10.0%, 35% at 10.5%)
- Distribution appropriately reflects two dominant scenarios
- Smooth percentile conversion from discrete mass

- **Score:** 15/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 9.75% | 9.75%* | 0 | 14/16 | Yes (but extraction failed) |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 10.0% | 10.25% | +0.25% | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | 10.50% | 10.25% | -0.25% | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 10.50% | 10.25% | -0.25% | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 10.25% | 10.0% | -0.25% | 15/16 | Yes |

*S2-1 extraction collapsed all percentiles to ~10.75%

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Did cross-model instances engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's S1-4):** Yes, explicitly referenced the reference class methodology and made appropriate adjustments for January hold signal.
- **S2-3 (o3-mini receiving Sonnet's S1-2):** Yes, corrected some of S1-2's upward bias while maintaining reasonable uncertainty.
- **S2-4 (o3 receiving o3-mini's S1-3):** Yes, successfully corrected S1-3's problematic inverted distribution.

**Did same-model instances behave differently than cross-model?**

- S2-1 (Sonnet receiving Sonnet) maintained its outside view (no change)
- S2-5 (o3 receiving o3) made slight easing adjustment
- Cross-model pairs showed more adjustment on average, suggesting cross-pollination added value

**Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity?**

Mixed. Cross-pollination helped correct the problematic S1-2 and S1-3 distributions (which implied rate hikes), but the extraction failure in S2-1 reduced effective diversity by one agent.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (SBP policy rate on May 1, 2026)
- All correctly identified the 91-92 day forecast window
- All correctly assessed current rate as 10.50% following Jan 26 hold

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Current policy rate: 10.50% (held on Jan 26, 2026)
2. Inflation: Headline 5.6%, core 7.4%
3. IMF program active with third review in May 2026
4. SBP guidance: "real policy rate adequately positive"
5. Recent easing cycle: 22% peak (Jun 2023) down to 10.50%

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-2 | MPC meeting count | Stated "only one scheduled meeting" before May 1 | Low - others estimated 1-2 |
| Multiple | December rate | Some sources showed 12% (Nov), some 10.5% (Jan) - timeline gaps | Low - Jan rate was clear |

### Hallucinations

None detected. All agents appropriately sourced their factual claims.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research quality:** The Agent report provided comprehensive, primary-source-based timeline of SBP decisions
2. **Strong reference class analysis:** S1-4 and S1-5 built rigorous empirical reference classes from historical data
3. **Appropriate uncertainty quantification:** Final distribution (P10=9.70%, P90=11.60%) reflects genuine uncertainty over 91-day window
4. **Good cross-pollination corrections:** S2-3 and S2-4 successfully corrected their problematic S1 inputs

### Weaknesses
1. **Agent 1 extraction failure:** Critical bug caused all percentiles to collapse to ~10.75%, corrupting aggregation
2. **S1-3 inverted logic:** Outside view implied rate hike despite easing cycle narrative
3. **Irrelevant current search results:** AskNews returned mostly non-Pakistan articles
4. **Query generation over-forecasting:** Research queries included probability estimates rather than pure information requests

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B-**

The forecast demonstrates good research quality and sound reasoning in most agents. However, the Agent 1 extraction failure is a critical technical bug that impacts the final aggregation, and S1-3's counterintuitive distribution adds noise. Without these issues, this would be a solid B+ forecast.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Filter AskNews results by country:** Add Pakistan-specific filtering to avoid irrelevant international articles
2. **Separate queries from analysis:** Query generation should output pure search queries, not scenario analyses
3. **Include MPC schedule query:** Explicitly search for upcoming meeting dates

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Fix extraction bug:** Agent 1's percentile extraction catastrophically failed - needs debugging
2. **Add sanity checks:** Flag distributions where median implies direction opposite to easing/tightening cycle
3. **Validate monotonicity:** Ensure extracted percentiles are strictly increasing

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **o3-mini (S1-3):** Needs better guidance on aligning distribution direction with stated narrative
- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-1):** Extraction format may have changed - investigate regex/parsing logic
- **o3 (S1-4, S1-5):** Excellent performance - consider higher weight if extraction is reliable

---

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (numeric) | No | Spread ~10% of 5-25% range |
| Update direction errors | No | All S2 updates consistent with evidence |
| Factual errors present | No | |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Corrected S1-2/S1-3 but S2-1 failed |
| Critical info missed in research | Partial | MPC schedule, analyst forecasts |
| Base rate calculation errors | Yes | S1-3 implied hike despite easing cycle |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | S2-1 extracted at 10.75 vs others 10.0-10.25 |
| Extraction failure | Yes | Agent 1 critical failure |
