# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| CDF Generation Error | Critical | Aggregation | Final prediction shows median at 97% (~19.4%) instead of expected ~10.5%, indicating severe CDF generation bug |
| Extremely Narrow Aggregated Distribution | Critical | Aggregation | Final 10th-90th percentile range of only 8.5-10.5% in the original scale is incorrect - prediction.json shows CDF values that don't match agent outputs |
| Test Mode (Haiku) Limitations | Medium | All Agents | All 5 agents used cheap Haiku model - limited analytical depth compared to production models |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast - The aggregation/CDF generation completely misrepresents the agents' actual predictions
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Pakistan monetary policy rate trends (Google)
2. State Bank of Pakistan economic forecast (Google News)
3. Analyze historical State Bank of Pakistan policy rate decisions, current economic challenges, and potential future monetary policy scenarios for 2026 (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Pakistan monetary policy inflation trends (Google)
2. State Bank of Pakistan economic forecast (Google News)
3. What are the current economic challenges and monetary policy directions for Pakistan in 2026? (Assistant)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Historical trends/patterns | Current and near-future projections |
| Content type | Rate trends, past decisions | Inflation data, current challenges |
| Unique contribution | Historical averages (11.63%), volatility range | Real-time inflation (5.6%), market expectations |

**Analysis:**
- Moderate overlap between query sets - both target similar sources
- Historical queries successfully established base rate context (average 11.63%, range 5.75%-22%)
- Current queries surfaced key recent data: current rate 10.5%, inflation 5.6%, market expecting rate cuts
- Gap: No queries specifically targeting SBP's forward guidance or rate cut timeline expectations

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs appropriately remain factual and do not include probability estimates. Sources are summarized with key statistics and expert opinions without making forecast claims. The Agent report provides economic context without explicit probability predictions.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current policy rate: 10.5%
  - Inflation: 5.6% (within 5-7% target)
  - Market expectations: 43.5% expected 75bp cut, 39.1% expected 50bp cut
  - Historical range: 5.75% to 22%
  - GDP growth projections: 3.75-4.75%

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Specific timing expectations for next MPC meetings
  - IMF program requirements/constraints on monetary policy
  - Scheduled resolution date context (question resolves May 1, but close was Jan 30)

- **Source quality:** Good - Mix of official SBP data, financial news (Tribune, Dawn), and economic analysis (Trading Economics, S&P)

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Haiku)

- **Source Analysis:** Good categorization of 5 sources with reliability ratings. Distinguished between factual data and expert opinions. Noted Trading Economics as "High" reliability.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 4 potential classes, selected "Recent Monetary Policy Trends (2024-2026)" as most suitable. Justification is adequate.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Incorrectly stated ~3 months when question was already closed. Did not note the question close time was Jan 30 01:30.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Distribution centered on 10.5% with P10=8.5, P90=13.5. Reasonable spread but only provided 6 percentiles (10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 90).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of ~10.5% (P40-P60) is well-justified
- Distribution shape is symmetric with slight upward bias
- Missing extreme percentiles (1, 5, 95, 99) limits tail calibration

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Haiku)

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (Median) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| S2-1 | Haiku | S1-1 (self-model) | ~10.5-11.5% |

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final Median | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Haiku | S1-1 | 10.5-11.5% | ~0 | 12/16 | Yes - stable evidence |
| S2-2 | Haiku | S1-4 | 10.5-11.5% | ~0 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | Haiku | S1-2 | 10.5% | ~0 | 12/16 | Yes - tighter appropriate |
| S2-4 | Haiku | S1-3 | 10.5-11.5% | ~0 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | Haiku | S1-5 | 10.5-11.5% | ~0 | 12/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- Cross-pollination in test mode provides no value since all agents use the same Haiku model
- All 5 Step 2 outputs produced nearly identical distributions
- S2-3 was slightly tighter (P99=13.0 vs 15.5) but overall minimal diversity
- The cross-pollination structure would be more valuable with production model mix (Sonnet 4.5, o3-mini, o3)

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (policy rate on May 1, 2026)
- **Critical issue:** Agents did not note that the question had already closed (Jan 30 01:30). The forecast was generated on Jan 30 at 20:35 UTC, after close.
- Current status correctly identified: 10.5% policy rate

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Current policy rate: 10.5%
2. Inflation at 5.6% in December 2025, within 5-7% target
3. GDP growth projections: 3.75-4.75%
4. Historical average: ~11.63%
5. Market expectations: majority expected rate cuts

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| All | Timeframe confusion | Did not recognize question had already closed | Low - doesn't affect rate prediction |
| FX Empire | Date error | States "January 2023" instead of 2026 | Low - isolated error |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All facts traceable to source documents.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. Good source analysis across all agents with appropriate reliability ratings
2. Correct identification of current policy rate (10.5%) and economic context
3. Reasonable percentile distributions centered on current rate with appropriate uncertainty
4. Calibration checklists completed correctly

### Weaknesses
1. **Critical:** CDF aggregation produced nonsensical final prediction (median at ~97% of scale = ~19.4% rate vs. agents' ~10.5%)
2. Test mode Haiku model produced near-identical outputs across all 5 agents - no meaningful diversity
3. Agents did not recognize question had already closed
4. Missing analysis of IMF constraints and specific MPC meeting timing

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: D**

Rationale: While the individual agent reasoning was adequate (B-level for test mode), the critical CDF aggregation bug makes the final submitted prediction completely unreliable. The aggregation shows a median around P50=97% (corresponding to ~19.4% policy rate), when all agents predicted medians around 10.5%. This is a fundamental pipeline failure.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. Add queries specifically targeting MPC meeting schedules and forward guidance
2. Include IMF program constraints as a search topic
3. Check question open/close times before generating forecasts

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Critical:** Debug CDF aggregation - current implementation produces incorrect results
2. Add validation step to compare final aggregated CDF against individual agent predictions
3. Add sanity check: flag if aggregated median differs significantly from agent consensus

### Model-Specific Feedback

- Haiku in test mode produces very homogeneous outputs - consider using at least 2 different cheap models for diversity
- Step 2 outputs are near-copies of each other - cross-pollination adds no value with identical models

---

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (numeric) | No | All agents within 2pp of each other |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates appropriately minimal |
| Factual errors present | Yes | Minor date error in one source |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | No | Same model = no diversity |
| Critical info missed in research | Yes | IMF constraints, MPC timing |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | No | All agents consistent |
| CDF aggregation error | Yes | Critical - final prediction wrong |
