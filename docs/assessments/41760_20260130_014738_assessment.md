# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

**Complete this section FIRST after reading all artifacts. List the most significant problems that affected forecast quality.**

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent 1 upward update based on single-day measurement | High | S2-1 | Updated median from 431.8 to 433.0 based on Jan 16 reading of 430.67 ppm, which may be a daily value not representative of monthly average |
| Wide spread between agents (3.7 ppm at 50th percentile) | Medium | Aggregation | Agent 5 median 431.2 vs Agent 1 median 433.0 creates significant ensemble disagreement |
| Research failed to surface historical April data series | Medium | Research | Despite queries requesting 2010-2025 April data, actual April values were not retrieved (only December 2025, May 2025) |
| Current search returned mostly irrelevant articles | Low | Research | AskNews returned volcano/weather articles from Ukraine, Netherlands, Hawaii weather - minimal CO2 data |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Mauna Loa CO2 April 2025 (Google)
2. Mauna Loa CO2 trend 2024 (Google News)
3. Monthly Mauna Loa CO2 2010-2025 with April subset (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. mauna loa co2 january 2026 (Google)
2. mauna loa co2 trend 2025 (Google News)
3. Give latest 2025-2026 Mauna Loa monthly averages (Assistant)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2010-2025 historical series, 2024 trends | Jan 2026, late 2025 data |
| Content type | Base rates, seasonal patterns, long-term trends | Recent measurements, current trajectory |
| Unique contribution | Reference class establishment | Real-time update for inside view |

**Analysis:**
- Queries are well-differentiated temporally - historical targets base rate establishment, current targets recent updates
- Historical queries appropriately targeted April-specific data and annual trends
- Critical gap: The agent report noted that actual numeric April values 2010-2025 were NOT retrieved despite the query - only metadata about where to find them
- Current queries successfully surfaced December 2025 (427.49 ppm) and May 2025 (430.2 ppm) but missed January 2026 monthly data
- One valuable finding: Sydney Morning Herald reported January 16, 2026 reading of 430.67 ppm (daily value)

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs appropriately remained factual. Key data points surfaced:
- Met Office forecast for 2025: 426.6 ± 0.6 ppm annual average, 2.26 ± 0.56 ppm growth
- December 2025: 427.49 ppm (NOAA)
- May 2025: 430.2 ppm (first time above 430 ppm)
- 2023-2024 increase: 3.58 ppm (record)

No inappropriate probability estimates were included in research summaries.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** December 2025 baseline (427.49 ppm), May 2025 peak (430.2 ppm), recent growth rates (2.09-3.58 ppm/year), seasonal cycle explanation, Met Office forecasts
- **Critical information missed:** Actual April 2025 value (agents had to estimate from May 2025), complete April historical series, January 2026 monthly average
- **Source quality:** Excellent - NOAA GML, NASA, Met Office, Scripps primary sources all cited appropriately

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

The outside view prompt asks each instance to:
- (a) Analyze sources, evaluate quality, distinguish fact from opinion
- (b) Identify reference classes, evaluate suitability, choose best one
- (c) State prediction timeframe, examine historical patterns
- (d) Justify the outside view prediction

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Evaluated 7 sources individually with quality assessments. Correctly distinguished facts (e.g., "December 2025: 427.49 ppm") from opinions (e.g., Ralph Keeling's "Another year, another record. It's sad."). Identified expert sources clearly.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified 3 reference classes (April 2010-2025, annual increases 2015-2025, December→April seasonal changes). Selected April measurements supplemented by seasonal pattern analysis - appropriate choice.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 90-day window stated. Good historical pattern analysis noting April is near annual peak, seasonal dynamics explained correctly.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Sound methodology. Started from December 2025 (427.49 ppm), added seasonal increase (3.0-4.0 ppm), cross-checked with year-over-year. Central estimate 431.5-432.0 ppm with σ ≈ 0.8 ppm.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate 431.8 ppm with 10th percentile 430.8 ppm, 90th percentile 432.8 ppm
- Distribution shape appropriate (approximately normal, reasonable uncertainty width of 2 ppm for 80% interval)
- Anchored well on December 2025 baseline

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Evaluated all major sources with credibility assessments. Correctly noted Met Office forecast is forward-looking, NOAA is primary. Slightly less detailed than S1-1.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Chose "April values 2015-2025 with year-over-year increases" - appropriate. Justified based on recent acceleration.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 2.5-3 months stated. Good seasonal pattern explanation with Dec-May rise noted as 2-3 ppm.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Sound. Estimated April 2025 at ~429.5-430 ppm (from May 2025 430.2), added 2.0-2.7 ppm growth. Central estimate 431.8 ppm with 90% CI ~430.5-433.2 ppm.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Median 431.8 ppm, 10th: 430.5, 90th: 433.2
- Reasonable distribution, slightly wider tails than S1-1
- Good uncertainty quantification

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (o3-mini)

- **Source Analysis:** Adequate. Covered key sources but less systematic evaluation. Identified Met Office, NOAA, Tech Explorist. Quality assessments present but brief.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified historical annual trends, seasonal cycle, and monthly progression. Combined seasonal cycle with annual growth trend - appropriate.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct. Noted 3-month horizon, December-May rise of 4.5-5 ppm.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Reasonable but slightly convoluted. Central estimate ~431.3 ppm via seasonal extrapolation with wide uncertainty (90% CI: 429-433.5 ppm).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Wider distribution than other agents (4.5 ppm for 80% interval)
- 10th: 429 ppm, 90th: 433.5 ppm
- Perhaps overly uncertain given predictability of CO2 measurements

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematic evaluation of 7 sources with credibility ratings. Distinguished fact from opinion cleanly. Noted data cut-off dates.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent. Identified 3 candidate classes with explicit evaluation. Selected "April year-to-year" as most informative, cited historical SD of 0.51 ppm.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent. Quantified seasonal ramp (Jan→Apr +1.8 ± 0.1 ppm) and trend component (0.22 ppm/month).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Rigorous. Two independent calculation paths (December-anchored and April-anchored) converging at 431.6-431.7 ppm. Detailed uncertainty budget (σ ≈ 0.51 ppm).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate 431.7 ppm, 90% CI: 430.7-432.7 ppm
- Tight, well-justified distribution
- Excellent quantitative rigor

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematic evaluation with quality ratings. Only 4 sources identified as "directly relevant" - appropriate filtering.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent. Identified 3 classes including "ENSO-conditioned April jumps" - sophisticated approach. La Niña springs average 2.1 ppm growth vs El Niño 2.7 ppm.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. 3-month horizon, seasonal ramp +0.7-0.9 ppm from January.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Rigorous. Started from April 2025 = 428.98 ppm (specific value from NOAA file), added 2.2 ppm adjusted for La Niña. Central estimate 431.18 ppm with detailed uncertainty budget.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Median 431.2 ppm, 10th: 429.8, 90th: 432.6
- Well-calibrated with fat-tail adjustment (25% inflation)
- Excellent use of ENSO conditioning

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Median) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 431.8 | 14/16 | Comprehensive source analysis | Less precise on April 2025 baseline |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 431.8 | 13/16 | Good seasonal understanding | Less quantitative uncertainty |

| S1-5 | o3 | 431.2 | 15/16 | ENSO-conditioned analysis | Slightly narrow tails |

---

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

The inside view prompt asks each instance to:
- (a) Analyze current sources, evaluate quality, distinguish fact from opinion
- (b) Weight evidence using Strong/Moderate/Weak framework
- (c) State timeframe, describe how prediction changes if halved/doubled
- (d) Justify shift from outside view base rate

Plus complete the calibration checklist: paraphrase, base rate stated, consistency check, top evidence, blind spot, status quo.

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Median |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 431.8 ppm |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 431.7 ppm |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 431.8 ppm |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (o3-mini) | 431.3 ppm |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 431.2 ppm |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied. Strong: December baseline 427.49 ppm, Jan 16 reading 430.67 ppm, seasonal peak pattern. Moderate: May 2025 430.2 ppm, 5-year trend 2.5 ppm/year. Weak: observatory closure threats, volcanic activity.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 431.8 → Output 433.0 (+1.2 ppm). Justified primarily by January 16, 2026 measurement of 430.67 ppm showing "faster seasonal climb" than expected.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Stated halving timeframe (to mid-March) would reduce estimate by ~1.0-1.5 ppm; doubling (to July-August) would yield 429.0-430.5 ppm (post-peak drawdown).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Target stated, base rate updated, consistency check done, top evidence listed, blind spot identified (stronger La Niña suppressing peak).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction: Upward, based on Jan 16 reading
- Concern: The Jan 16 reading may be a daily value, not representative of monthly average. December 2025 → Jan 16 jump of 3.2 ppm in 2.5 weeks is unusually steep.
- Final distribution: Median 433.0 ppm (10th: 432.1, 90th: 434.0)

- **Score:** 13/16 (magnitude of update may be excessive)

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good application. Strong: December 2025 baseline, 2024 record 3.58 ppm growth, seasonal Jan→Apr rise. Moderate: Met Office forecast 2.3 ppm, January 16 reading (treated cautiously). Weak: political funding threats, volcano activity.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 431.7 → Output 432.0 (+0.3 ppm). Modest update justified by evidence of "continued acceleration" balanced against La Niña dampening.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Halving (45 days to mid-March) → -2 ppm; doubling (6 months to July) → account for full seasonal decline.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All elements addressed including blind spot (La Niña stronger than expected pushing to 431.2 ppm).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction appropriate and conservative
- Appropriately treated Jan 16 reading as uncertain
- Final distribution: Median 432.0 ppm (10th: 431.1, 90th: 432.9)

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (o3-mini): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Strong: NOAA December 2025 (427.5-427.6 ppm), seasonal amplitude 2.5-3 ppm. Moderate: year-over-year increases, moderated growth. Weak: political/operational concerns.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 431.8 → Output 431.8 (no change). Justified as evidence confirms outside view baseline; seasonal uptick and moderated growth are as expected.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. 3-month horizon with seasonal uplift; halving would reduce seasonal component.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Clear target statement, base rate, consistency check, key evidence, blind spot (sudden ENSO transition pushing higher).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- No update reflects confidence in outside view
- Appropriately tight distribution: Median 431.8, 10th: 431.0, 90th: 433.0
- Conservative but well-reasoned

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Thorough systematic analysis. Strong: multi-decadal seasonal cycle (+2.5-3.5 ppm Dec→Apr), long-term growth 2.4 ppm/year. Moderate: 2024 exceptional 3.5 ppm growth, Met Office outlook. Weak: NOAA funding interruption.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 431.3 → Output 432.2 (+0.9 ppm). Justified by adjusting for El Niño carry-over (+0.5 ppm), regression toward mean (-0.1 ppm), combined with baseline adjustment.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Halving (mid-March) → -1 ppm; doubling (end-July) → -1.5 ppm from post-peak drawdown.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with detailed elements. Blind spot: large tropical fire or ENSO-amplified jump pushing above 434 ppm.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Good justification for upward revision from S1-3's low estimate
- Wider distribution: Median 432.2, 10th: 430.5, 90th: 433.6
- Appropriate given uncertainty in received S1-3 input

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Systematic with clear Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Strong: NOAA time-series, ENSO link. Moderate: Met Office forecast, 2024 regression to mean. Weak: political threats, volcano SO2.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 431.2 → Output 431.2 (no change). Explicitly maintained baseline with minor La Niña adjustment already incorporated.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Quantified: 76 days to target midpoint, seasonal ramp 0.8 ± 0.1 ppm. Halving would shrink distribution ~20%; doubling would enlarge σ by ~40%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and rigorous. Blind spot: instrument shutdown in March 2026 with Scripps backup failure → data gap.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Conservative maintenance of outside view
- Tight distribution: Median 431.2, 10th: 429.9, 90th: 432.3
- Lowest central estimate in ensemble

- **Score:** 15/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 431.8 | 433.0 | +1.2 | 13/16 | Partial - magnitude may be excessive |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 431.7 | 432.0 | +0.3 | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | 431.8 | 431.8 | 0 | 14/16 | Yes - evidence confirms baseline |
| S2-4 | o3 | 431.3 | 432.2 | +0.9 | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 431.2 | 431.2 | 0 | 15/16 | Yes - baseline maintained with ENSO adjustment |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Did cross-model instances engage meaningfully with received outside view?**
  - S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's S1-4): Yes, engaged well with rigorous o3 baseline, made modest adjustment
  - S2-3 (o3-mini receiving Sonnet's S1-2): Yes, maintained baseline after confirming evidence alignment
  - S2-4 (o3 receiving o3-mini's S1-3): Yes, appropriately corrected for S1-3's wider uncertainty

- **Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**
  - S2-4 arguably corrected appropriately for S1-3's low central estimate, showing good calibration
  - No clear cases of ignoring the cross-pollinated input

- **Did same-model instances behave differently?**
  - S2-1 (Sonnet-Sonnet): Made large +1.2 ppm update
  - S2-5 (o3-o3): Made no update
  - Same-model pairs showed different behavior, suggesting the cross-pollination structure doesn't create systematic biases

- **Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity?**
  - Final spread: 1.8 ppm (433.0 - 431.2)
  - S1 spread: 0.6 ppm (431.8 - 431.2)
  - Cross-pollination INCREASED diversity, primarily due to S2-1's large upward update

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (April 2026 monthly average CO2 at Mauna Loa in ppm)
- All correctly identified the forecast timeframe (~90 days to April)
- All correctly assessed current status (December 2025 ~427.5 ppm, seasonal climb underway)

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. December 2025 baseline: 427.49 ppm (NOAA official) - unanimous
2. May 2025 seasonal peak: 430.2 ppm - unanimous
3. 2023-2024 growth: 3.58 ppm (record) - unanimous
4. Seasonal cycle: April near annual peak, autumn is minimum - unanimous
5. La Niña conditions expected to moderate 2025-2026 growth - unanimous

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-1 | Treated Jan 16 daily as significant | 430.67 ppm may not represent monthly average | Medium |
| S1-3 | Wider uncertainty than warranted | CO2 is highly predictable, 4.5 ppm 80% CI may be too wide | Low |
| All | April 2025 was estimated, not measured | Agents derived ~429.4-430 ppm from May 2025; actual value unclear | Low |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All factual claims are traceable to research sources:
- December 2025: 427.49 ppm (NOAA)
- May 2025: 430.2 ppm (Tech Explorist/Scripps)
- January 16, 2026: 430.67 ppm (Sydney Morning Herald)
- Met Office forecast: 2.26 ± 0.56 ppm growth

One agent (S1-5, S2-5) cited "April 2025 = 428.98 ppm from NOAA raw file" - this is plausible but not directly verified in the research artifacts. Could be accurate if agent had access to additional data.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent source quality evaluation**: All agents systematically distinguished fact from opinion and assessed source credibility
2. **Strong methodological rigor**: Multiple calculation paths (December-anchored vs April-anchored) with cross-checks
3. **Appropriate uncertainty quantification**: Most agents provided well-calibrated 80-90% intervals with justified σ estimates
4. **Good seasonal understanding**: All agents correctly identified April as near-peak and incorporated seasonal dynamics
5. **ENSO conditioning**: Several agents (especially o3) appropriately adjusted for La Niña effects

### Weaknesses
1. **Research gap on April historical data**: Despite queries, actual April 2010-2025 values were not retrieved
2. **Inconsistent treatment of January 2026 data**: S2-1 made large update based on potentially unrepresentative daily value
3. **No agent accessed actual NOAA data file**: The agent report noted the CSV is available but none retrieved it
4. **Current news search yielded poor results**: AskNews returned mostly irrelevant weather/volcano articles

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

Rationale: Strong source analysis, sound methodological approaches across all agents, and appropriate uncertainty quantification. Deducted from A due to: (1) research not surfacing actual April historical values, (2) questionable magnitude of S2-1's update based on single-day measurement, and (3) moderate ensemble spread suggesting some disagreement about update direction.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Direct data retrieval**: Implement capability to download and parse NOAA's co2_mm_mlo.csv directly to get actual historical April values
2. **Better news filtering**: Current AskNews queries returned mostly irrelevant results; consider more specific query construction
3. **Verify daily vs monthly values**: When citing recent readings, verify whether they represent daily or monthly averages

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Clarify update magnitude guidance**: Step 2 could benefit from explicit guidance on when large updates (>1 ppm) are warranted
2. **Cross-reference requirement**: Could require agents to verify surprising data points against multiple sources before making large updates
3. **Historical base rate requirement**: For predictable time series like CO2, require actual historical values rather than derived estimates

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-1)**: May need guidance to be more conservative with updates based on single data points
- **o3-mini (S1-3)**: Uncertainty intervals were wider than other models; consider prompting for tighter calibration on well-understood systems
- **o3 (S1-4, S1-5)**: Excellent quantitative rigor; serves as benchmark for other models

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (numeric) | No | 1.8 ppm spread / 15 ppm range = 12% |
| Update direction errors | Uncertain | S2-1's +1.2 update may be excessive |
| Factual errors present | No | All major facts verified |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Increased diversity but not clearly improved accuracy |
| Critical info missed in research | Yes | April historical series not retrieved |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All calculations are sound |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | S2-1 at 433.0 vs mean ~432.0 |

  Median: ~427.5 ppm [Note: This appears incorrect based on CDF values;
          may be a CDF interpretation issue - the submitted percentiles
          show values in the 0.01-0.99 range as probabilities, not ppm values]

Actual S2 medians average: (433.0 + 432.0 + 431.8 + 432.2 + 431.2) / 5 = 432.0 ppm
```

**Note on prediction.json**: The CDF values appear to be cumulative probabilities (0.01 to 0.99) mapped to the question's range (420-435 ppm). The 50th percentile CDF value of ~0.02 corresponds to approximately 427.5 ppm on the range, but this seems inconsistent with the agent outputs. This may indicate a CDF generation or aggregation issue worth investigating.
