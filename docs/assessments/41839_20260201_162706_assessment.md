# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

**Complete this section FIRST after reading all artifacts. List the most significant problems that affected forecast quality.**

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| No significant issues identified | N/A | N/A | This was a high-quality forecast with strong consensus and appropriate calibration |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

**Note:** This forecast demonstrated excellent quality across all agents with strong consensus (1-2% range), appropriate reasoning, and no significant errors. The tight spread reflects the near-certainty of the outcome given the extremely short timeframe (4 days) and overwhelming evidence against renewal.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "New START suspension Russia 2023" (Google)
2. "New START renewal negotiations 2025" (Google News)
3. "Provide a detailed timeline (2021-2026) of official U.S. and Russian statements, negotiations, or proposals concerning extending or replacing New START..." (Agent - comprehensive timeline request)

**Current Queries:**
1. "New START extension 2026 negotiations" (Google)
2. "New START successor treaty February 2026" (Google News)
3. "Latest 2026 reports on US-Russia discussions to renew or replace New START nuclear arms treaty before its expiration on February 5 2026" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2021-2025 treaty history, 2023 suspension | Jan-Feb 2026 (final days before expiration) |
| Content type | Legal/structural constraints, timeline of events, official positions | Breaking news, current negotiation status, latest statements |
| Unique contribution | Establishes legal impossibility of formal extension, documents Putin's Sept 2025 proposal | Confirms no US response, no active negotiations as of Feb 1 2026 |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets were highly complementary and well-differentiated. Historical queries successfully established the crucial legal constraint (Article XIV already used in 2021) and the September 2025 Putin proposal.
- Current queries successfully surfaced extremely recent news (Feb 1, 2026) confirming no formal US response after 4+ months and no active negotiations.
- The agentic search for historical context was particularly valuable, providing a comprehensive timeline that all agents relied upon.
- No critical information gaps identified - the research comprehensively covered both the structural/legal constraints and the current diplomatic status.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remained appropriately factual and did not inappropriately offer probability estimates. Expert opinions were clearly attributed (e.g., Dr. Sokov's "very low" likelihood assessment for verification restoration) but the research layer did not attempt to forecast the binary outcome. The agentic search appropriately concluded with "information gaps" rather than probability estimates.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Legal impossibility of formal extension (Article XIV one-time extension already used in 2021)
  - Putin's September 2025 one-year informal freeze proposal
  - No formal US response after 4+ months
  - Multiple Feb 1, 2026 sources confirming no active negotiations
  - Trump's "if it expires, it expires" statement
  - Expert consensus on expiration being likely

- **Critical information missed:** None identified - research was comprehensive

- **Source quality:** Excellent - included Arms Control Association (specifically mentioned in resolution criteria), VCDNP, CFR, State Department, SIPRI, multiple major news agencies (AFP, Reuters, SCMP)

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Evaluated each source individually (ACA, SIPRI, VCDNP, CFR, Agent Report), distinguished factual content from expert opinion, identified key experts (Dan Smith, Dr. Sokov, Blinken), noted dates and relevance. Correctly identified irrelevant sources.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considered 4 reference classes (US-Russia renewals, post-suspension agreements, high-tension arms control, informal political arrangements). Chose "informal political arrangements" as most suitable given the question context.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 4-day window, noted historical precedent (2021 extension in 48 hours), analyzed pattern of 4+ months inaction.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derived conditional probability chain: 5-15% × 60-80% × 80-90% = 2.4-10.8%, then adjusted down to 4% based on definitional uncertainty and structural barriers.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 4% probability with clear reasoning
- Considered both Yes and No pathways extensively
- Appropriately weighted the legal impossibility of formal extension

- **Score:** 15/16 (Minor: could have been more explicit about reference class base rate)

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough. Evaluated each source quality, distinguished facts from opinions, noted expert credentials (Sokov, Kimball). Correctly identified the 4-day constraint.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considered multiple classes including US-Russia treaty extensions, high-tension negotiations, and short-timeframe (4-day) treaty negotiations. Appropriately selected the most restrictive class.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Detailed analysis of 4-day constraint, noted historical pattern (2021 extension in 48 hours when goodwill existed), contrasted with current 4+ months of inaction.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Used historical treaty patterns (SALT, START, SORT, INF). Noted recent trend of arms control collapse. Derived 2% with clear justification.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 2% probability
- Explicitly addressed the definitional ambiguity (informal freeze vs. formal renewal)
- Sound conditional probability analysis

- **Score:** 15/16 (Excellent overall)

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive. Categorized sources by quality (High: ACA, VCDNP, State Dept; Mixed: Agent report). Explicitly noted what was factual vs. opinion for each source. Identified the legal constraint clearly.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considered three reference classes: US-Russia treaty expiry history, major bilateral treaties near deadline, political freezes. Selected hybrid of classes (1) and (3) as most suitable.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly noted 4-day window, analyzed how probability would change with halved/doubled timeframe, identified the "fast mechanism" as reciprocal political declaration.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Qualitative base rate ("very low, but not literally zero"), arrived at 3% with clear reasoning about the narrow "fast" pathway.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 3% probability
- Thorough analysis of both Yes and No pathways
- Good integration of legal constraints

- **Score:** 14/16 (Good reference class analysis, slightly less rigorous quantitative derivation)

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but effective. Evaluated source reliability for each key document, noted expert credentials. Appropriately discarded irrelevant sources.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considered three classes: (i) US-Russian treaties approaching expiration, (ii) treaties renegotiated with <6 months remaining, (iii) treaties where one party suspended compliance. Chose class (iii) as best match, noted 0/3 historical survival rate.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 4-day constraint, noted impossibility of Senate ratification, noted impossibility of Duma ratification.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 0% (class iii base rate), added 1-2% tail for informal deal being branded as successor. Final calibration: 1%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 1% probability
- Sound mathematical reasoning from reference class
- Appropriately pessimistic given structural constraints

- **Score:** 15/16 (Excellent, perhaps slightly over-confident at 1%)

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Well-organized. Evaluated each source with factual/opinion distinction, noted credentials and dates. Correctly identified the 2021 extension exhaustion issue.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Evaluated three classes: (1) START treaties at end-of-term (20% renewal rate), (2) treaties renewed after suspension (0%), (3) treaties requiring Senate vote <30 days (0%). Adopted class 2.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly noted 4-day window, compared to 2021 extension (9 days), noted no other example of week-long treaty rescue.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 0% base from class 2, applied 1% floor for model uncertainty, then halved and added tail risk for 0.7% final estimate.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 0.7% probability
- Most conservative estimate with clear reasoning
- Sound probability calibration methodology

- **Score:** 15/16 (Excellent quantitative reasoning)

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 4% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 1% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 2% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 3% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 0.7% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent. Applied Strong/Moderate/Weak framework explicitly. Strong evidence: multiple sources confirm no US response (Asharq Al-Awsat, SCMP, AFP, Firstpost), legal impossibility, Trump's explicit statements, expert consensus, time constraint. Moderate: collapsed verification, geopolitical context. Weak: Putin's proposal exists, Trump's initial positive rhetoric.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 4% → Output: 1%, Δ = -3pp) Significant downward update justified by current day's news confirming no agreement and Trump's "if it expires, it expires" statement.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed explicitly - if halved to 2 days, would drop to ~1%; if doubled to 8 days, might increase to 8-10%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all six elements thoroughly with specific evidence citations.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (down) matched evidence direction (strongly negative)
- Final 1% internally consistent with stated reasoning about near-zero probability of surprise announcement

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Comprehensive framework application. Strong evidence (4 items): no negotiations confirmed by both sides, Senate ratification impossible, historical pattern (all suspended treaties collapsed), political will absent. Moderate: Trump's stated position, expert consensus. Weak: Putin's proposal, unpredictability of Trump diplomacy.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 1% → Output: 1%, Δ = 0pp) Maintained 1% base rate after adjustment factors largely cancelled out (-0.3% for explicit confirmation, -0.2% for Trump's disinterest, +0.3% for resolution criteria flexibility, +0.2% for surprise possibility).
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Detailed analysis - if halved (2 days), ~<0.5%; if doubled (8 days), 3-5%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed with evidence.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Maintained 1% with explicit justification
- "1 out of 100" consistency check performed
- Blind spot identified (secret backchannel)

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applied Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong (2 items): VCDNP structural/legal constraint, multiple independent reports confirming no negotiations. Moderate: Trump's stated position, expert consensus. Weak: Putin's offer, Trump-Putin communication channel exists.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 2% → Output: 1%, Δ = -1pp) Downward shift justified by late-Jan/Feb 1 reporting being "net-negative" (no formal action, "Trump mum").
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicit analysis - if halved (2 days), near-zero; if doubled (8 days), still low single digits.
- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (down) appropriate
- Final 1% with clear justification
- Identified blind spot (sudden Trump-Putin announcement)

- **Score:** 15/16 (Slightly less detailed than S2-1 and S2-2)

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured analysis. Strong: legal/structural constraint, public record (no negotiations from multiple sources). Moderate: Putin's proposal exists, Trump's initial positive remark later contradicted. Weak: diplomatic surprises possible.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 3% → Output: 2%, Δ = -1pp) Downward adjustments: -2pp for confirmed absence of negotiations, -0.5pp for US indifference, -0.3pp for legal impossibility. Upward: +0.5pp for Putin's standing offer.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed - probability would roughly halve if only 2 days remained.
- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed with evidence.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- "2 out of 100" consistency check
- Slightly higher than other agents but well-justified
- Identified blind spot (secret bilateral back-channel)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Comprehensive. Strong (3 items): structural/legal constraint, historical pattern (all suspended pacts lapsed), 11 outlets confirming "no negotiations". Moderate: Putin's 12-month proposal, 2021 precedent. Weak: Trump's "sounds good" contradicted later.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 0.7% → Output: 1%, Δ = +0.3pp) Slight upward adjustment: -0.5pp for structural barriers, +0.4pp for Putin's offer pathway = 0.9% rounded to 1%.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed - probability would quadruple to ~4% with 30 days, would halve to ~0.5% with 48 hours.
- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed with evidence citations.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (slight up) from very conservative base
- Final 1% internally consistent
- Clear blind spot identification

- **Score:** 16/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 4% | 1% | -3pp | 16/16 | Yes - current day news strongly negative |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 1% | 1% | 0pp | 16/16 | Yes - maintained with explicit reasoning |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 2% | 1% | -1pp | 15/16 | Yes - Feb 1 reporting net-negative |
| S2-4 | o3 | 3% | 2% | -1pp | 15/16 | Yes - multiple negative factors |
| S2-5 | o3 | 0.7% | 1% | +0.3pp | 16/16 | Yes - slight upward from ultra-conservative |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**
  - Yes. S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3's 1%) explicitly acknowledged the base rate and applied adjustment factors. S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet's 2%) directly referenced the outside view as "2% base rate." S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's 3%) explicitly noted "Outside-view base rate: 3%" and applied systematic adjustments.

- **Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**
  - No. All instances treated the cross-pollinated input appropriately as a starting point for adjustment rather than as a fixed constraint or irrelevant input.

- **Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**
  - S2-1 (Sonnet receiving own model's 4%) made a larger update (-3pp) than cross-model instances, driven by the current day's news. S2-5 (o3 receiving own model's 0.7%) made a small upward adjustment (+0.3pp). The behavior differences appear driven by the different base rates rather than same-model vs cross-model effects.

- **Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**
  - Cross-pollination contributed to strong convergence - despite Step 1 outputs ranging from 0.7% to 4%, all Step 2 outputs converged to 1-2%. This convergence was appropriate given the extremely strong current-day evidence against renewal.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **Did all instances correctly understand the resolution criteria?**
  - Yes. All instances correctly identified that resolution requires "credible reports such as by the Arms Control Association" of either (1) New START extended to at least Feb 5, 2027, or (2) a successor agreement lasting at least that long.

- **Did they accurately identify the forecast timeframe?**
  - Yes. All instances correctly identified the 4-day window (Feb 1 to Feb 5, 2026).

- **Did they correctly assess the current status/state of affairs?**
  - Yes. All instances correctly identified: treaty expires Feb 5, 2026; Russia suspended in 2023; Putin proposed informal freeze Sept 2025; no formal US response; no active negotiations.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. New START cannot be formally extended again (Article XIV one-time extension already used in 2021)
2. Putin proposed one-year informal adherence to limits in September 2025
3. No formal US response to Putin's proposal as of Feb 1, 2026
4. Trump stated "if it expires, it expires"
5. Only 4 days remaining until treaty expiration

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| None identified | N/A | N/A | N/A |

### Hallucinations

None detected. All key facts were properly sourced from the research outputs and correctly attributed.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent source analysis across all agents** - Each instance properly evaluated source quality, distinguished fact from opinion, and identified expert credentials.
2. **Strong convergence on appropriate probability** - Despite different models and cross-pollination pathways, all agents converged to 1-2%, reflecting appropriate calibration for a near-certain negative outcome.
3. **Rigorous timeframe awareness** - All agents explicitly addressed the 4-day constraint and its implications for probability.
4. **Proper use of current-day evidence** - Step 2 appropriately incorporated the Feb 1, 2026 news confirming no negotiations, justifying downward updates.
5. **Clear calibration methodology** - Multiple agents used explicit "X out of 100" consistency checks and conditional probability chains.

### Weaknesses
1. **Minor spread in Step 1 outputs (0.7% to 4%)** - While appropriate diversity, the range could be slightly narrower given the strong evidence.
2. **Model notation inconsistency** - Template refers to o3-mini but config shows GPT-5.2 for forecaster_3.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: [A]**

This forecast exemplifies high-quality ensemble forecasting. The research phase surfaced all critical information including the legal impossibility of formal extension and the current diplomatic status. All five agents demonstrated rigorous reasoning, appropriate reference class selection, and sound probability calibration. The strong convergence (1-2% range) on an extremely low probability is well-justified by the overwhelming evidence against renewal in the 4-day window with no active negotiations.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

- None needed - research was comprehensive and well-targeted.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

- The tight spread (1-2%) is appropriate for this question but may indicate the ensemble could be more efficient (fewer agents) for questions with such overwhelming evidence in one direction.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (S1-1):** Started slightly higher (4%) but made appropriate large update in Step 2 based on current evidence.
- **GPT-5.2 (S1-3/S2-3):** Solid performance, slightly less detailed than other instances in Step 2.
- **o3 (S1-4/S2-4):** Slightly higher final output (2% vs 1%) - could be more conservative.
- **o3 (S1-5/S2-5):** Most rigorous quantitative methodology, appropriately conservative base rate.
