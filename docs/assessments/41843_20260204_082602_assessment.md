# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Percentile extraction failure | Critical | S2-1, S2-2 | Markdown bold formatting (`**`) in output caused regex extraction to fail, losing 2/5 forecasters from aggregation |
| Significant forecaster divergence | High | S1-1/S1-2 vs S1-3/S1-4/S1-5 | Forecasters disagree fundamentally on whether COVID baseline creates a rebound effect (+10-16%) or near-zero change (-2 to +2%) |
| Baseline interpretation ambiguity | High | All S1 outputs | Forecasters interpreted "2020" differently - some as pandemic-depressed annual average, others as Jan 2020 pre-COVID baseline |
| Missing sector-specific data | Medium | Research | No actual Carbon Monitor ground transport figures were surfaced - only total emissions trends |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. global ground transport CO2 Carbon Monitor (Google)
2. transportation CO2 emissions 2025 forecast (Google News)
3. Provide annual global ground transportation CO2 emission data 2020-2025 with percentage changes (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Carbon Monitor 2025 ground transport emissions (Google)
2. global road transport CO2 2025 (Google News)
3. Latest data on 2025 global ground transportation CO2 emissions compared to 2020 (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | General historical trends + 2020-2025 data request | 2025 specifics, comparison to 2020 |
| Content type | Base rate establishment, methodology | Recent news, preliminary estimates |
| Unique contribution | EDGAR methodology, uncertainty bands (±6%) | Global Carbon Budget 2025 (+1.1% fossil CO2), regional transport data |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are appropriately discrete - historical targets methodology and baselines, current targets recent measurements
- Historical queries successfully identified EDGAR as authoritative source and established ±6% uncertainty
- Current queries surfaced Global Carbon Budget 2025 data and regional transport trends (EU -0.1%, US flat)
- **Critical gap:** Neither query set successfully retrieved actual Carbon Monitor ground transport sector data for 2020-2025. All sources provide either total emissions or regional data, requiring significant extrapolation

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs remained largely factual. The ICCT report included a model projection that road transport "could peak as soon as 2025" - this is appropriately labeled as scenario-dependent. The query generator's analysis appropriately frames expectations rather than providing probability estimates.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - EDGAR uncertainty bands (±6% at 95% CI)
  - Global fossil CO2 trends: +5.4% (2021), +1.9% (2022), +0.1% (2023), +0.9% (2024), +0.6% (2025)
  - Regional transport: EU -0.1% in 2025, US essentially flat
  - Oil consumption +1% in 2025 (primary transport fuel)
  - EV adoption data (Beijing 50% of new registrations)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Actual Carbon Monitor ground transport sector totals for 2020-2024
  - The exact value of the 2020 ground transport baseline
  - Sector-specific (not total) rebound percentages 2021-2022

- **Source quality:** High for methodological sources (Nature paper, EDGAR, Global Carbon Budget). Regional data (EU, US, Singapore) is high quality but limited geographic coverage. Carbon Monitor website pages provided policy/disclaimer info but no actual data.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of each source with explicit quality judgments (3/4). Correctly identifies Carbon Monitor as resolution source, notes EDGAR ±6% uncertainty. Distinguishes factual methodology from data gaps.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Chooses "global ground transportation 2010-2020 with COVID adjustment" (3/4). Good choice but doesn't quantify historical base rates.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 5-year window and that period has ended (4/4). Good temporal decomposition (2020 drop, 2021-22 recovery, 2023-25 stagnation).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses compounding model: 100→88→95→99→100→100→100 = ~0% net change (3/4). Reasonable but doesn't formally anchor to reference class data.

**Numeric assessment:**
- Centered near 0% with modest positive skew
- Distribution: p10=-12%, p50≈-0.5%, p90=+8%
- Notably more pessimistic than other forecasters - treats EU/US stagnation as representative of global

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Similar quality to S1-1, good evaluation of each source (3/4).
- **Reference Class Selection:** Explicitly identifies "global ground transportation emissions 2010-2020" and provides context (3/4). Could quantify historical growth rates more precisely.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct window, good discussion of COVID baseline ambiguity (3/4).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Estimates +2% to +8% central range based on "COVID-depressed baseline + recovery" logic (3/4). More positive than S1-1.

**Numeric assessment:**
- Centered around +5.5%
- Distribution: p10=-2%, p50≈+5.5%, p90=+13%
- Moderate rebound assumption

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Briefer but accurate evaluation (3/4). Notes key limitation that no sources provide actual Carbon Monitor figures.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Chooses "post-shock recovery sectors after 2020 COVID" (4/4). This is the most appropriate framing - explicitly models rebound dynamics.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct, notes outcome is already "locked in" historically (3/4).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Central estimate +16-20% based on "dip then recovery" pattern (3/4). The most bullish outside view, driven by treating 2020 as severely depressed.

**Numeric assessment:**
- Centered around +18%
- Distribution: p10=+7%, p50≈+18%, p90=+32%
- Very high rebound assumption - notably different from Sonnet models

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but comprehensive (3/4). Correctly prioritizes EDGAR as authoritative global dataset.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Explicitly uses "previous 5-year changes in global ground-transport CO2" with data: 2005-10 (+11%), 2010-15 (+3%), 2015-20 (-7%) → mean +2%, σ≈9% (4/4). Best quantified reference class.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct, notes 14 months post-2025 end and data revision risk (4/4).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from +2% reference class mean, adjusts to +11% central based on pandemic rebound mechanics. Explicitly models Normal(μ=+11%, σ=5.5%) (4/4). Most rigorous derivation.

**Numeric assessment:**
- Centered around +11%
- Distribution: p10=-1%, p50≈+10.5%, p90=+22%
- Well-calibrated uncertainty

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Brief but accurate (3/4). Similar to S1-4.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses "change when first year is extreme recession year" (2009-14 analogue) with +8% to +15% rebounds typical (4/4). Good alternative framing.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct, notes zero forward uncertainty, only revision risk (4/4).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Baseline +12% from rebound reference class, adjusts for EV (-1%), developing world (+2%), efficiency (-1%) = net +12% (4/4). Clear adjustment framework.

**Numeric assessment:**
- Centered around +12%
- Distribution: p10=-3%, p50≈+9%, p90=+22%
- Similar to S1-4

- **Score:** 15/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (p50) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ≈-0.5% | 13/16 | Detailed source analysis | Overly influenced by EU/US stagnation |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ≈+5.5% | 12/16 | Balanced consideration | Weaker quantification |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ≈+18% | 13/16 | Clear rebound framing | Very high central estimate |
| S1-4 | o3 | ≈+10.5% | 15/16 | Quantified reference class with data | None significant |
| S1-5 | o3 | ≈+9% | 15/16 | Clear adjustment framework | None significant |

**Notable divergence:** Sonnet 4.5 models (S1-1, S1-2) center much lower than o3/GPT-5.2 models. This reflects different interpretations of whether 2020 should be treated as a severely depressed baseline requiring rebound adjustment.

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (p50) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | ≈-0.5% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ≈+10.5% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ≈+5.5% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ≈+18% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | ≈+9% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good use of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework (4/4). Correctly identifies COVID baseline drop, recovery pattern, and 2023-25 stagnation as strong evidence.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ≈-0.5% → Output: p50≈+2%, Δ = +2.5pp (3/4). Modest upward shift based on evidence of recovery, but still conservative.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses halved (negative) vs doubled (positive) scenarios (3/4).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completes all elements including blind spot (developing world data quality) (4/4).

**Numeric assessment:**
- Final: p10=-8%, p50≈+2%, p90=+12%
- **EXTRACTION FAILED:** Output used `**Percentile 10: -8**` format with trailing `**` that regex couldn't parse

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Thorough application of framework (4/4). Strong evidence: pandemic baseline, EV penetration, oil growth constraints.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ≈+10.5% (from S1-4) → Output: p50≈+9.5%, Δ = -1pp (3/4). Slight downward adjustment - interesting that Sonnet shifts o3's estimate down.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis of halved/doubled windows (3/4).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with blind spot (emerging market freight growth underestimate) (4/4).

**Numeric assessment:**
- Final: p10=+2%, p50≈+9.5%, p90=+17%
- **EXTRACTION FAILED:** Same formatting issue - `**Percentile 10:** 2` with colon-then-space pattern

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework application (3/4). Interesting insight that "Jan 2020 vs Dec 2025" point-to-point comparison differs from annual average comparison.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ≈+5.5% (from S1-2) → Output: p50≈+5%, Δ = -0.5pp (3/4). Minor downward adjustment based on point-to-point vs annual interpretation.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed (3/4).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete including blind spot about Carbon Monitor seasonal patterns (3/4).

**Numeric assessment:**
- Final: p10=-6%, p50≈+5%, p90=+19%
- **EXTRACTION SUCCEEDED:** Clean format `Percentile 10: -6`

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong application (4/4). Explicitly quantifies: "2020 ground-transport CO₂ ≈10-15% below 2019".
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ≈+18% (from S1-3) → Output: p50≈+16%, Δ = -2pp (3/4). Slight downward adjustment but maintains high rebound estimate.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but correct - notes 26 days to resolution, data revision risk (3/4).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with blind spot about Carbon Monitor potentially revising 2020 drop smaller (4/4).

**Numeric assessment:**
- Final: p10=+4%, p50≈+16%, p90=+28%
- **EXTRACTION SUCCEEDED:** Clean format

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong (4/4). Clear Strong/Moderate/Weak categorization with evidence items.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ≈+9% (from S1-5) → Output: p50≈+11%, Δ = +2pp (4/4). Modest upward shift with clear justification.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Correct analysis of data revision risk (3/4).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with good blind spot (2020 drop over-estimated → higher actual change) (4/4).

**Numeric assessment:**
- Final: p10=-2%, p50≈+11%, p90=+20%
- **EXTRACTION SUCCEEDED:** Clean format

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input (p50) | Final (p50) | Delta | Score | Update Justified? | Extraction |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------|-------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ≈-0.5% | ≈+2% | +2.5pp | 14/16 | Yes | **FAILED** |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ≈+10.5% | ≈+9.5% | -1pp | 14/16 | Partial | **FAILED** |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ≈+5.5% | ≈+5% | -0.5pp | 12/16 | Yes | Success |
| S2-4 | o3 | ≈+18% | ≈+16% | -2pp | 14/16 | Yes | Success |
| S2-5 | o3 | ≈+9% | ≈+11% | +2pp | 15/16 | Yes | Success |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3's S1-4):** Did engage meaningfully - took the +10.5% input and adjusted slightly down to +9.5%. Demonstrates cross-model influence working as intended.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet's S1-2):** Received moderate input (+5.5%) and stayed near it (+5%). Less dramatic shift than expected given GPT-5.2's own outside view was much higher (+18% in S1-3).

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's S1-3):** Received high input (+18%) and adjusted down moderately to +16%. Reasonable engagement with cross-pollinated view.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** Behaved consistently with their received outside views. S2-1 stayed conservative, S2-5 stayed moderate.

- **Net effect on diversity:** Cross-pollination did NOT significantly reduce divergence. Final outputs still range from +2% (S2-1) to +16% (S2-4). The fundamental disagreement about COVID baseline interpretation persists.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **Resolution criteria:** All instances correctly understood that Carbon Monitor ground transport data would be the resolution source.
- **Timeframe:** All correctly identified Jan 2020 to Dec 2025 as the comparison period.
- **Current status:** All acknowledged the event period has ended but data is unpublished.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. 2020 saw significant COVID-related emissions drop (estimates varied 5-15%)
2. 2021-2022 showed strong recovery
3. 2023-2025 showed flat/slow growth in developed economies
4. EDGAR/Carbon Monitor have ±6% uncertainty
5. Global fossil CO2 +1.1% in 2025, oil +1%

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1, S2-1 | Interpretation | Extrapolated EU/US flat trends to global, may underweight developing world growth | Medium |
| S1-3, S2-4 | Interpretation | Very high rebound assumption (+18%) may overstate 2020 drop | Medium |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All cited sources and statistics appear accurate and verifiable.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong methodological foundation:** o3 models (S1-4, S1-5) provided excellent quantified reference classes with historical data
2. **Good source evaluation:** All forecasters correctly assessed source quality and distinguished fact from opinion
3. **Appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment:** All noted ±6% EDGAR uncertainty and Carbon Monitor revision risk
4. **Comprehensive checklist completion:** Forecasters addressed blind spots and consistency checks

### Weaknesses
1. **Critical extraction bug:** 2/5 forecasters lost due to markdown formatting in output - fundamentally compromised ensemble
2. **Unresolved baseline interpretation:** Major disagreement on whether 2020 was severely depressed (-15%) or moderately low (-5-10%) baseline
3. **Missing sector-specific data:** No forecaster obtained actual Carbon Monitor ground transport figures; all extrapolated from total emissions
4. **Aggregation only used 3 forecasters:** Final forecast excluded S2-1 (most conservative) and S2-2 (moderate) - biasing toward higher estimates

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: C**

The extraction bug is a critical infrastructure issue that fundamentally compromised the ensemble. If S2-1 and S2-2 had been included, the final forecast would have been centered lower (around +7-8% rather than +10%) with wider uncertainty. The remaining forecasters showed good analytical quality individually, but the ensemble diversity benefit was lost.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add explicit queries for Carbon Monitor sector-specific data files (the agent report correctly identified EDGAR but didn't extract values)
- Include historical base rate lookup: "global ground transport CO2 annual change 2015-2020"

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Update `normalize_percentile_line()` to strip trailing `*` characters, not just leading ones
- Alternatively, update regex to allow optional trailing `**`
- Add validation that extracts at least 4/5 forecasters before proceeding with aggregation
- Consider failing loudly if >1 forecaster fails extraction

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Output formatting inconsistent - used `**bold**` markdown around percentiles. Prompt should explicitly forbid markdown formatting in final predictions.
- **o3/GPT-5.2:** Clean output formatting - good compliance with expected format

---

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range | Yes | Range: -50 to +50. Spread: +2% to +16% (14pp) across working forecasters; 18pp if including failed extractions. ~28% of range. |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates justified by evidence direction |
| Factual errors present | No | All facts verified |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Did influence outputs but didn't resolve fundamental disagreement |
| Critical info missed in research | Yes | Actual Carbon Monitor ground transport sector values |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | o3 models had rigorous base rate derivation |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | S2-4 at +16% is notably higher than others |
| Extraction failures | Yes | 2/5 forecasters failed - CRITICAL |
