# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Most research sources about wrong lawsuit | Medium | Research | Majority of search results cover K.G.M. bellwether trial and New Mexico AG case, not the specific multistate AG coalition case. Agent report partially compensates. |
| AskNews deep research failed | Low | Research | AskNews deep research returned a 403 error (usage limit exceeded), reducing current-news coverage |
| Research outputs contain forecasts in agent report | Low | Research | Agent report concludes with predictive framing ("appears poised to continue") though largely avoids explicit probabilities |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical only) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Partially (deep research failed with 403) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No (not relevant) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not relevant) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No (not relevant) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "Meta youth addiction lawsuit settlement" (Google)
2. "Meta state attorneys general lawsuit status" (Google News)
3. "Provide a detailed update on People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc., including latest docket entries, any court-ordered mediation, public statements about settlement talks, and compare timelines of prior multi-state AG tech settlements (Juul, Google Play, Cambridge Analytica, TikTok) highlighting filing-to-settlement durations." (Agent)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "Meta youth mental health lawsuit settlement" (Google)
2. "Meta attorneys general lawsuit settlement status" (Google News)
3. "Have any US state attorneys general settled their youth addiction lawsuit against Meta since November 2023?" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Case history since Oct 2023 + analogous settlements | Latest news Jan-Feb 2026 |
| Content type | Docket analysis, procedural history, reference class timelines | Recent trial coverage, settlement news, current litigation posture |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | PACER docket analysis, comparative settlement timelines | Real-time trial developments, parallel case settlements |

**Analysis:**
- Historical and current queries are moderately overlapping in search terms but serve different purposes. The current queries appropriately target recent settlement news.
- The Agent query was excellent—highly specific, requesting docket analysis and cross-case timelines. It returned the most decision-relevant artifact: confirmation of no ADR/mediation activity through Feb 2.
- Historical queries successfully established the reference class (Juul 30mo, Google Play 29mo, Cambridge Analytica 57mo).
- The main weakness is that Google/Google News results overwhelmingly returned articles about the K.G.M. personal injury bellwether trial rather than the specific multistate AG case. Only one article (Top Class Actions, Dec 30 2025) directly addressed the AG case's procedural status.
- AskNews deep research failed (403 error), but the standard AskNews articles provided useful context on parallel litigation.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report is largely factual and docket-based but closes with a mildly predictive conclusion: "the matter appears poised to continue through intensive merits litigation rather than immediate settlement negotiations." This is a reasonable inference from the evidence rather than an inappropriate probability estimate. The article summaries appropriately remained factual.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - PACER docket showing no ADR/mediation through Feb 2, 2026
  - Comparative settlement timelines (Juul 30mo, Google Play 29mo, Cambridge Analytica 57mo)
  - Dec 30, 2025 letter brief showing adversarial trial-structure dispute
  - Meta refusing to settle K.G.M. bellwether while TikTok/Snap settled
  - Motion to dismiss denial (Oct 2024)
  - Texas biometric $1.4B Meta settlement precedent

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Meta's SEC filings/10-K for loss contingency language (noted as gap by Agent but not retrieved)
  - Any sealed docket entries or off-record ADR communications

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Mixed relevance—mostly about wrong case but included key Top Class Actions article on AG trial structure dispute
  - Agent report: Excellent—comprehensive PACER analysis with specific docket citations, timeline comparisons
  - AskNews articles: Moderate—provided parallel litigation context (NM trial, EU charges, MA hearing) but nothing about the specific AG case settlement

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematically evaluated each source with quality ratings, clearly distinguished the K.G.M. case from the AG case, identified the Agent report as "very high" quality. Separated fact from opinion throughout. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 4 reference classes with explicit suitability ratings (HIGH/MODERATE/LOW). Selected multistate AG tech settlements as best match. Also included TikTok parallel case as contemporary comparison. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Precisely stated 22-day window, calculated case age (27.5 months), mapped historical settlement mechanics (negotiation, drafting, 40+ state approvals, announcement) to show time insufficiency. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear probabilistic calculation: 5% chance of secret negotiations × 20% chance of completion in 22 days = 1%, plus 1% buffer = 2%. Mathematically explicit and well-reasoned. (4/4)

- What probability did they derive and how? 2%, via conditional probability chain
- Did they consider both Yes and No pathways? Yes, explicitly listed 6 factors against and 4 factors for settlement

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Good systematic evaluation with quality assessments per source. Correctly identified key distinction between K.G.M. and AG cases. Agent report findings highlighted appropriately. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 4 reference classes (multistate AG tech, Meta-specific, Cambridge Analytica, TikTok parallel). Selected multistate AG combined with TikTok as reference. Good justification. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 22-day window, mapped case timeline at 27 months. Good analysis of historical patterns showing case approaching early edge of settlement window. (3/4 — less detailed than S1-1 on settlement mechanics)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Calibrated via odds framework (99:1 too confident, 19:1 reasonable, 9:1 too hedged). Arrived at 4% with clear reasoning about what the remaining uncertainty represents. (4/4)

- What probability did they derive and how? 4%, via odds-based calibration
- Did they consider both Yes and No pathways? Yes, 5 factors against (strong) and 3 factors for (weak)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Most thorough source-by-source analysis of any forecaster. Seven numbered sources with explicit quality ratings, fact vs opinion separation, and relevance assessments. Particularly strong on distinguishing the Agent report's factual basis from its analytical overlay. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three well-defined classes with pros/cons for each. Selected multistate AG actions as best match. Explicitly noted why bellwether personal-injury cases are a poor match for timing despite thematic relevance. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 22-day window. Developed a hazard-rate conversion (12-month window, 0.7 months remaining, pre-window timing) that was analytically sophisticated. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Calibrated to 4-8% range, chose 6% midpoint reflecting both "late surprises happen" and "multistate settlement within 3 weeks is hard." Slightly higher than peers—perhaps reflecting a wider uncertainty band rather than different evidence assessment. (3/4 — the final 6% is arguably generous given the evidence presented)

- What probability did they derive and how? 6%, via hazard rate with qualitative adjustments
- Did they consider both Yes and No pathways? Yes, explicit pro-Yes and pro-No sections with clear weighting

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient five-source analysis with appropriate quality distinctions. Strong emphasis on Agent report's key finding of no ADR activity. Correctly noted it "cannot inspect sealed items" as a limitation. (3/4 — slightly more compressed than peers)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three classes with explicit sample sizes and filing-to-settlement durations. Provided a quantitative base rate: "Only 2/5 (40%) settled by 30m, 1/5 (20%) by 27m." Most data-driven approach. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Developed formal hazard rate: 40% by 30m minus 20% by 27m = 20% over 3 months ≈ 6-7% per month. Applied 0.76-month multiplier. Discounted for no visible settlement posture. Analytically rigorous. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started at 6.5%, applied point-by-point adjustments (-3, -2, -1, +2, +1 = -3pp), arrived at 3.5%, rounded to 4%. Clear methodology with explicit adjustments. (4/4)

- What probability did they derive and how? 4%, via hazard rate + point adjustments
- Did they consider both Yes and No pathways? Yes, explicit positive and negative adjustments

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Five-source analysis closely paralleling S1-4 but with slightly different emphasis. Correctly identified Agent report as highest weight. Good quality tier assignments. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same three classes as S1-4 with similar reasoning. Referenced empirical filing-to-settlement spans. Chose same reference class with similar quantitative framing. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Identical hazard rate approach to S1-4 (6%/month × 0.76 months = 4.6% baseline). Well-executed mechanical calculation. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started at 4.6%, applied adjustments (-1pp no ADR, -1pp coordination, -0.5pp Meta litigation posture, +0.5pp bellwether pressure), arrived at 3.6% → rounded to 4%. Clear and explicit. (4/4)

- What probability did they derive and how? 4%, via hazard rate + adjustments (nearly identical method to S1-4)
- Did they consider both Yes and No pathways? Yes, balanced positive/negative adjustments

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 2% | 16/16 | Conditional probability chain; most rigorous | Slightly more aggressive downward than evidence warrants |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 4% | 15/16 | Odds-based calibration; clear reasoning | Less detailed on settlement mechanics |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 6% | 15/16 | Most thorough source analysis | 6% arguably generous given own evidence |
| S1-4 | o3 | 4% | 15/16 | Quantitative hazard rate with explicit adjustments | Compressed source analysis |
| S1-5 | o3 | 4% | 15/16 | Clean hazard rate methodology | Very similar to S1-4 (limited diversity) |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 2% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 4% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 4% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 6% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 4% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong evidence: Dec 2025 adversarial filing, no ADR, insufficient time, 40+ state coordination. Moderate: Meta's litigation posture, TikTok parallel. Weak: settlement history, case age. Thorough and well-organized. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 2% → Output: 2%, Δ = 0pp) Maintained the 2% outside view, reasoning that current news reinforced rather than altered the base case. Explicit conditional probability: 5% secret negotiations × 15% completion = 0.75%, plus 1.25% buffer. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halving (< 1%) and doubling (~5-8%) with reasoning for each. (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 6 elements completed thoroughly. Paraphrase accurate, base rate stated, consistency check explicit ("2 out of 100 times"), top evidence listed, blind spot identified (secret negotiations), status quo assessed. (4/4)

- Did the update direction match the evidence direction? Yes—evidence reinforced low probability, no change made.
- Is the final probability internally consistent with stated reasoning? Yes—reasoning strongly supports ≤3%.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Identified Dec 2025 adversarial filing as new key evidence not in outside view. Correctly weighted the 22-day constraint as dominant. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 4% → Output: 3%, Δ = -1pp) Small downward adjustment driven by Dec 2025 adversarial filing and additional evidence of zero settlement discussions. Net -1.5pp from base, rounded to 3%. Adjustment well-justified. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halving → 1%, doubling → 6-8%. Clean analysis with reasoning for each. (3/4 — less detailed than S2-1)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. "3 out of 100 times" consistency check. Identified K.G.M. trial disaster as specific blind spot. (4/4)

- Did the update direction match the evidence direction? Yes—new adversarial evidence justified slight downward move.
- Is the final probability internally consistent? Yes.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Extensive source-by-source analysis covering PBS, BBC, Top Class Actions, CalMatters, CNBC, AskNews, and the Agent report. Two-tier weighting (Strong toward NO, Moderate mixed, Weak adjustments). Most thorough current-source analysis. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 4% → Output: 5%, Δ = +1pp) Small upward nudge from 4% to 5%, justified by escalating multi-front pressure and proximity to historical settlement windows. Cautious adjustment. (3/4 — the +1pp upward adjustment is defensible but the evidence presented mostly reinforces downward pressure)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halving → 2-3%, doubling → 8-12%. Well-calibrated ranges. (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed. Consistency check ("5 out of 100 times"), blind spot identified (off-docket global settlement), base rate stated. (4/4)

- Did the update direction match the evidence direction? Partially—the +1pp upward shift reflects generic pressure rather than specific settlement signals. Most current evidence (adversarial Dec filing, Meta litigating bellwether) suggests downward if anything.
- Is the final probability internally consistent? Mostly, though the reasoning for upward adjustment is the weakest element.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but effective. Strong: no mediation, live summary-judgment, coalition size. Moderate: Meta fighting bellwether, expert commentary. Weak: simultaneous jury trials creating reputational risk. (3/4 — compressed)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 6% → Output: 5%, Δ = -1pp) Adjusted from 6% base down to 5%, applying net -1.5pp downward (no ADR, coordination, Meta posture) and +2pp upward (trial pressure). Reasonable. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halving → 3%, doubling → 9-10%. Appropriate. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. "5 out of 100 times" consistency check. Blind spot identified (secret negotiations). (4/4)

- Did the update direction match the evidence direction? Yes—downward from 6% to 5% is appropriate given evidence.
- Is the final probability internally consistent? Yes.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Efficient categorization matching S2-4's structure. Same key evidence identified. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 4% → Output: 5%, Δ = +1pp) Adjusted upward from 4% to 5%, with inside-view evidence adding +2pp (trial pressure) and subtracting -1pp (Meta posture). (3/4 — +1pp upward is mildly surprising given the same evidence S2-4 used to move downward)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halving → 2-3%, doubling → ~9%. Consistent with peers. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Consistency check and blind spot identified. (4/4)

- Did the update direction match the evidence direction? Marginally—the upward nudge is defensible as the bellwether trial adds some pressure, but the dominant evidence is against settlement.
- Is the final probability internally consistent? Mostly consistent.

- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 2% | 2% | 0pp | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 4% | 3% | -1pp | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 4% | 5% | +1pp | 15/16 | Partial |
| S2-4 | o3 | 6% | 5% | -1pp | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 4% | 5% | +1pp | 13/16 | Partial |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):** All engaged meaningfully with their received outside views. S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3's 4%) made a slight downward adjustment based on additional adversarial-filing evidence. S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet 4.5's 4%) made a small upward nudge. S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's 6%) brought the highest outside view down to 5%. Cross-pollination functioned as intended—convergence toward the center.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 maintained its own model's aggressive 2% estimate. S2-5 nudged its own model's 4% up to 5%. Different behaviors—S2-1 showed confidence in self-model's lower estimate while S2-5 adjusted slightly upward.

- **Diversity impact:** Cross-pollination produced **convergence** in this case—all five outputs clustered between 2-5%, tighter than the S1 range of 2-6%. This is appropriate behavior when evidence is this one-sided. The tight spread reflects genuine agreement rather than groupthink.

- **Overall effectiveness:** Moderate. With such strong evidence pointing in one direction and tight S1 agreement, cross-pollination had limited room to add value. It did help pull the S1-3 outlier (6%) down to 5%.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: settlement of *People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc.* specifically, requiring substantial majority of participating states, formal resolution of core allegations.
- All correctly identified the March 1, 2026 deadline and the 22-day forecast window.
- All correctly assessed the current status: active litigation with no settlement signals.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Case filed October 24, 2023; currently ~27 months old
2. No ADR referral, mediation, or settlement stay on docket as of Feb 2, 2026
3. K.G.M. bellwether trial is a different case from the AG coalition suit
4. Meta refused to settle K.G.M. case while TikTok and Snap settled
5. Historical reference class: Juul ~30 months, Google Play ~29 months
6. Motion to dismiss denied in October 2024
7. Dec 30, 2025 letter brief showed adversarial trial-structure dispute (noted by S2 instances with access to current research)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-2 | Minor | States "33+ state coalition" while question references 42 state AGs (33 federal + 9 state court) | Low |
| S1-3 | None detected | — | — |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected across any output. All factual claims are traceable to the provided sources or are reasonable inferences from public information. The Agent report's PACER citations (ECF numbers, docket dates) appear internally consistent. Some forecasters reference "sealed docket entries" as a caveat—this is an appropriate acknowledgment of information limits rather than a hallucination.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Exceptional source discrimination:** Every forecaster correctly distinguished between the K.G.M. bellwether, the New Mexico AG case, and the specific multistate AG coalition case. This is critical given that most search results concerned the wrong lawsuit.
2. **Consistent reference class analysis:** All forecasters independently converged on the same reference class (multistate AG tech settlements) with similar timeline estimates, increasing confidence in the analytical framework.
3. **Tight, well-calibrated ensemble:** The 2-5% range with 4% average is highly appropriate given the evidence. The 22-day window combined with no settlement infrastructure makes settlement near-impossible.
4. **Strong use of Agent report:** The PACER docket analysis was the most decision-relevant artifact, and all forecasters appropriately weighted it heavily.

### Weaknesses
1. **Limited S1 diversity between o3 instances:** S1-4 and S1-5 used nearly identical methodologies (hazard rate approach with similar adjustments), producing minimal analytical diversity.
2. **Minor upward drift in S2-3 and S2-5:** Both nudged upward (+1pp) despite current evidence broadly reinforcing the low base rate. The justification (mounting pressure) is plausible but thin.
3. **Research tool mismatch:** Most Google results returned articles about the wrong lawsuit. While forecasters handled this well analytically, a more targeted query (e.g., "People of California v Meta Platforms settlement 2026") might have surfaced more directly relevant material.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: A-**

This is one of the strongest forecasts in the assessment set. All forecasters demonstrated excellent analytical discipline—correctly disambiguating multiple lawsuits, applying appropriate reference classes, and producing a tight, well-calibrated ensemble. The 4% prediction appropriately reflects the near-impossibility of a complex multistate settlement materializing in 22 days with no prior signals. Minor weaknesses (limited o3 diversity, slight upward drift in some S2 outputs) prevent a full A.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add query targeting the specific case docket number (4:23-cv-05448-YGR or MDL 3047) to surface directly relevant articles
- Consider adding CourtListener or PACER as a direct research source for legal questions

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- None significant—the pipeline performed well on this question type. The two-stage (outside/inside view) approach with cross-pollination worked as intended.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (S1-1/S2-1):** Excellent performance—most rigorous probabilistic reasoning with conditional probability chains. S1-1 produced the best-justified probability.
- **GPT-5.2 (S1-3/S2-3):** Strongest source analysis but slightly generous base rate (6%). The +1pp upward shift in S2 was mildly unjustified.
- **o3 (S1-4/S1-5, S2-4/S2-5):** Strong quantitative methodology (hazard rates) but insufficient analytical diversity between the two o3 instances. Consider varying the prompt framing or temperature for same-model instances.
