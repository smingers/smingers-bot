## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Fundamental disagreement on whether Al Green censure (Mar 2025) satisfies resolution criteria | Critical | S1/S2 all | Forecasters split on whether "before April 1, 2026" includes events before the question opened (Feb 11, 2026). S2-3/S2-5 read literally and predict ~99%; S1-3/S1-4/S2-2/S2-4 treat it as forward-looking and predict 17-28% |
| Massive ensemble spread (71pp) | Critical | Aggregation | S2 outputs range from 28% to 99%, creating an average (62.2%) that reflects no single forecaster's reasoning — it's an artifact of bimodal disagreement |
| AskNews deep research failed (quota exceeded) | Med | Research | AskNews deep research returned "ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded," reducing current-event coverage |
| Irrelevant search results consumed research budget | Med | Research | Multiple articles about state legislatures (Maine, Tennessee, Texas), foreign governments (Peru, Japan, China), and unrelated congressional topics diluted current-event search quality |
| No forecaster checked the fine print synced-question clause | Med | S1/S2 all | The fine print states this question is synced with an original question (post 40852) that opened 2025-11-25. None of the forecasters analyzed whether this affects interpretation of the time window |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (1 query, comprehensive) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (standard articles only; deep research failed: quota exceeded) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No (not relevant) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not relevant) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No (not relevant) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (history.house.gov, govtrack.us scraped) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "recent House censures reprimands list" (Google) — returned historical discipline list
2. "pending censure resolution House 2026" (Google News) — returned Nov 2025 coverage
3. "Provide all privileged resolutions in the 119th Congress that seek to censure, expel, or reprimand a representative" (Agent) — comprehensive ledger of 8 resolutions

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "House censure expel reprimand 2026" (Google) — returned mixed results
2. "House censure vote February 2026" (Google News) — returned recent coverage
3. "Give the latest developments since January 2026 on resolutions to censure, expel, or reprimand U.S. House members" (AskNews) — 16 articles returned; deep research failed (403 quota error)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Base rate establishment, 119th Congress privileged resolutions | January-February 2026 developments |
| Content type | Official records, legislative history, November 2025 coverage | News articles, congressional hearing reports |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Comprehensive ledger of all discipline resolutions with vote tallies | McIver incident (Feb 10), ICE funding tensions, Maxwell testimony |

**Analysis:**
- Historical queries were well-targeted. The Agent query was excellent, producing a comprehensive ledger of all 8 privileged discipline resolutions in the 119th Congress with specific vote tallies and outcomes.
- The question URL scraping of history.house.gov and govtrack.us provided strong foundational data on all historical discipline actions.
- Current queries suffered from poor signal-to-noise ratio. AskNews returned many irrelevant articles about state legislatures (Maine, Tennessee, Texas), foreign governments (Peru, Japan, China), and unrelated congressional matters. Only 3-4 of 16 articles were directly relevant.
- **Critical gap:** No query specifically targeted the fine print's synced-question clause (original question opened Nov 25, 2025) or Metaculus resolution practices for similar questions. This information was essential for the core interpretive disagreement.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report appropriately concludes with "Current take-aways for the forecasting question" framed as analytical observations rather than probability estimates. It identifies that Al Green's censure is a "criterion-satisfying 'Yes' event" — a factual observation that became the central analytical issue.

AskNews articles are factual news reports without explicit forecasts.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Complete record of Al Green censure (March 6, 2025, 224-198 vote) — the decisive fact
  - Full list of 119th Congress privileged discipline resolutions (8 total)
  - Multiple ongoing investigations (Mills, Mace, Collins, McIver)
  - Beyer-Bacon reform proposal (29 co-sponsors, 60% threshold)
  - November 2025 "censure week" with 5 attempts in 5 days

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Metaculus resolution practices for synced questions with pre-existing qualifying events
  - Whether the question's closing date (Feb 11, 2026) affects the evaluation window
  - Community prediction as a cross-check

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: High quality — history.house.gov, Roll Call, WSJ, NYT, TIME all provided authoritative data
  - Agent report: Very good — comprehensive legislative ledger with specific roll-call numbers and dates; directionally accurate and consistent with official records
  - AskNews articles: Low relevance — most articles were off-topic (foreign legislatures, unrelated US politics); the few relevant articles (McIver hearing, Maxwell testimony) added marginal value

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all sources. Correctly identifies Maine articles as irrelevant. Notes Al Green censure occurred March 6, 2025 — before question opened Feb 11, 2026 — but initially flags this as "satisfying question criteria," then reverses to say the question asks about events from the opening date forward. This internal contradiction reveals uncertainty about criteria interpretation.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 reference classes; chooses post-June 2023 period (~2.3 censures/year) as most suitable. Reasonable given the documented regime change.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly calculates 49-day window. Notes multiple pending cases (Mills, Cherfilus-McCormick) but frames the question as forward-looking.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts with ~30% from trend, adjusts for active cases (+20-25%), reform pressure (-10-15%), Mills specifics (+15-20%). Arrives at 52% via sequential adjustments. The adjustment arithmetic is somewhat ad hoc — stacking four adjustments compounds imprecision.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 52% through cumulative adjustment from base rate
- Considers both Yes pathways (Mills, Cherfilus-McCormick, new incidents) and No pathways (failures, reform)
- The 52% seems high for a 49-day forward-looking estimate given that most attempts fail

- **Score:** 10/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive. Makes a critical analytical observation: Al Green was censured March 6, 2025, which "ALREADY satisfies the resolution criteria" since the question asks about events "before April 1, 2026" with no start date specified. This is the strongest interpretive argument in the ensemble.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Acknowledges the question may already be resolved, making reference class analysis moot. For completeness, identifies 2021-2025 rate (~1.25/year) and 119th Congress activity.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Notes the censure occurred 342 days before question opening. Correctly reads the resolution criteria as backward-looking.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Argues this is "not a probabilistic forecast but a verification of historical fact." Assigns 99.2% based on certainty of past event minus ~0.8% for interpretation/administrative risk.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 99.2% through fact verification rather than forecasting
- The only uncertainty acknowledged is whether the question resolver might apply an implicit "from opening date" rule
- This is a strong, defensible reading of the literal resolution criteria

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Most detailed per-source evaluation. Carefully categorizes each source by quality, date, and fact vs. opinion. Correctly dismisses Maine articles and Wake Up To Politics as irrelevant.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Chooses 2021-2025 era as most relevant. Uses Poisson approximation: λ ≈ 1.5 × 0.134 ≈ 0.20, P(≥1) ≈ 18%. This is the most methodologically rigorous base rate derivation in the ensemble.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly frames as forward-looking (49 days from Feb 11 to April 1). Notes that clustering in specific political moments affects whether Poisson is appropriate.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 17.8% from Poisson model. Explicitly notes this is "low enough to respect that most 7-week windows have no discipline passage, high enough to reflect the post-2021 step-change."

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 17.8% through Poisson approximation — methodologically sound
- Treats the question as purely forward-looking without addressing the Al Green precedent
- The approach is internally consistent but ignores the resolution criteria interpretation question

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but adequate. Correctly categorizes all sources. Notes Maine/Wake Up To Politics as irrelevant.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses 2020-2025 era (7 actions in 6 years = 1.17/year). Poisson conversion: λ = 1.17 × 0.134 ≈ 0.16, P(≥1) ≈ 14.8%. Rounded to 18% after adjusting for surprise events and volatility.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 49-day window. Notes Al Green's March 2025 censure shows discipline can occur in this calendar window, but treats it as base rate evidence rather than a resolution-satisfying event.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 18% through Poisson model with upward volatility adjustment. Clean, transparent calculation.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 18% — very close to S1-3's 17.8%
- Does not address whether the Al Green censure already satisfies the criteria
- Methodologically sound within its forward-looking framing

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Adequate but briefer than others. Correctly identifies key sources.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses post-2019 period (~1.1 actions every 9-12 months). Notes 119th Congress already produced one qualifying event (Green censure). Then recognizes this event falls within the scoring window.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Identifies that "a qualifying event has already happened" (Green censure, March 6, 2025). Argues the resolution condition is already satisfied since censure is irreversible.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts with base rate of ~78% for any discipline in a 15-month window, then recognizes confirmed event pushes to ~100% minus 2% for clerical/interpretive error. Arrives at 98%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 98% through confirmed-event logic
- Explicitly models the remaining risk as "clerical/interpretive error by the question resolver" at ~2%
- This is a defensible reading aligned with S1-2's interpretation

- **Score:** 13/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 52% | 10/16 | Considers multiple pending cases and structural incentives | Internal contradiction on criteria interpretation; ad hoc adjustment stacking |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 99.2% | 13/16 | Strongest literal reading of resolution criteria | May underweight possibility that resolver applies implicit start date |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 17.8% | 12/16 | Most rigorous Poisson methodology for forward-looking estimate | Ignores the Al Green precedent entirely |
| S1-4 | o3 | 18% | 12/16 | Clean Poisson calculation with volatility adjustment | Does not address whether Green censure already resolves the question |
| S1-5 | o3 | 98% | 13/16 | Explicitly models remaining risk as resolver error | Could better justify the 2% residual uncertainty estimate |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Prediction |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 52% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 18% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 99.2% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 17.8% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3) | 98% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1 (52%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Identifies structural incentives (privileged resolution rule), pending cases (Mills, Cherfilus-McCormick, McIver), and Jeffries' intent statement as strong evidence. Correctly notes McIver's Feb 10 incident as fresh catalyst. However, does not address the central question of whether Green's censure already satisfies the criteria.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 52% → Output: 58%, Δ = +6%. Modest upward adjustment driven by specific pending cases (Mills two resolutions, Cherfilus-McCormick indictment, McIver fresh incident). Individual case probabilities estimated: Mills 25-30%, Cherfilus-McCormick 15-20%, McIver/new 15-20%, combined ~58%.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halving to ~3.5 weeks drops to 35-40%, doubling to ~14 weeks increases to 70-75%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed meaningfully. Blind spot identified (all pending cases stall). Status quo analysis supports slight lean toward action.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction matches evidence direction (fresh incidents + pending cases → modest increase)
- The +6pp shift is modest and proportional to the marginal information
- However, the fundamental criteria interpretation issue is not addressed, limiting analytical value

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4 (18%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured analysis with active investigations as strongest factor. Identifies Mills Ethics subcommittee (2.5 months into investigation), Cherfilus-McCormick pending expulsion, and McIver incident. Correctly notes expulsion requires 2/3 vote (historically near-impossible). Calendar constraint analysis is strong: only ~15 legislative days in the 49-day window.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 18% → Output: 28%, Δ = +10%. Clear itemized adjustments: Mills investigation (+8%), Cherfilus-McCormick (+3%), McIver (+2%), compressed calendar (-3%). Net +10pp.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halving to 24 days drops to ~10%, doubling to 98 days rises to 35-40%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot well-articulated (sudden Ethics report triggering immediate vote). Status quo analysis supports "no action" as modal outcome.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The +10pp shift is well-justified by specific catalysts absent from base rate
- Calendar constraint analysis is the strongest in the ensemble
- Like S2-1, does not address the Green censure interpretation issue

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2 (99.2%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Focuses on verifying the factual claim that Green was censured. Identifies House History page as "definitive" and notes multiple independent confirmations. Distinguishes the García "disapproval" (which may not qualify as censure/reprimand) from Green's formal censure.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 99.2% → Output: 99.7%, Δ = +0.5%. Tiny upward adjustment based on the strength of independent confirmation from official records. Models remaining uncertainty as "adjudicator error" at ~0.3%.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** States timeframe is irrelevant since qualifying event already occurred. Correct within this interpretive framework.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot identified: "the resolver applies an unstated rule 'only actions after Feb 11, 2026 count.'" This is the right blind spot but the 0.3% weight assigned seems too low.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probability is internally consistent with literal reading of criteria
- The fact-verification approach is appropriate given the interpretation chosen
- The extracted probability of 99% is reasonable (rounding from 99.7%)

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 (17.8%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise evidence bullets (≤20 words each) — effective format. Identifies privileged-resolution rule, post-2021 step-change, Cherfilus-McCormick indictment, Mills probe, and Beyer-Bacon reform as key factors. Properly weights structural factors above anecdotal incidents.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 17.8% → Output: 28%, Δ = +10.2%. Itemized: +4% (privileged resolutions), +5% (two high-salience cases), +2% (partisan heat), -1% (reform pushback). Clean arithmetic.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halving to 3.5 weeks drops to ~9%, doubling to 14 weeks rises to mid-40%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot (sudden Ethics report) is appropriate. Status quo correctly identified as "no resolution passes."

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The +10pp shift closely mirrors S2-2's reasoning and magnitude
- Does not address the Green censure interpretation, consistent with forward-looking framing
- "28 out of 100 times" consistency check is reasonable

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5 (98%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Confirms Al Green censure via multiple independent sources. Notes censure is irreversible. Identifies remaining risk as adjudicator/interpretation error only.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 98% → Output: 98%, Δ = 0%. Maintains prior assessment. Explicitly rejects any need for adjustment since the qualifying event is confirmed historical fact.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** States timeframe is irrelevant — qualifying event in the past. If window were doubled/halved, makes no difference.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot: "Question writer silently restricts count to actions ≥ 11 Feb 2026." This is exactly the right concern. Status quo produces Yes.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- No update from outside view is well-justified given the fact-verification approach
- The 2% residual for adjudicator error is a reasonable estimate
- Internal consistency is strong

- **Score:** 13/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 52% | 58% | +6% | 11/16 | Yes (specific cases) |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 18% | 28% | +10% | 13/16 | Yes (active investigations + calendar analysis) |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 99.2% | 99% | -0.2% | 13/16 | Yes (fact verification) |
| S2-4 | o3 | 17.8% | 28% | +10.2% | 12/16 | Yes (parallel reasoning to S2-2) |
| S2-5 | o3 | 98% | 98% | 0% | 13/16 | Yes (no new information changes confirmed fact) |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4/o3's 18%):** Engaged productively with the low outside view and adjusted upward by +10pp based on specific current catalysts. Cross-pollination worked as intended — the model independently arrived at a forward-looking estimate rather than anchoring on the received input.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2/Sonnet 4.5's 99.2%):** Accepted the "already resolved" interpretation from S1-2 and moved slightly upward to 99.7%. This is the expected behavior — when the cross-pollinated input presents a compelling factual argument (Green censure already happened), the receiving model adopted that framing. Cross-pollination was effective in transmitting the interpretive insight.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3/GPT-5.2's 17.8%):** Received the forward-looking Poisson-based estimate and independently adjusted upward by +10pp to 28% — nearly identical to S2-2's estimate. This convergence between S2-2 and S2-4 (both receiving low inputs from different models) suggests the forward-looking camp had an internal consensus around 28%.

- **Same-model instances:** S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving 52%) moved to 58%; S2-5 (o3 receiving 98%) stayed at 98%. Same-model instances maintained their interpretive frameworks.

- **Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity?** Increased dramatically. The key interpretive split (literal reading vs. forward-looking) was amplified through cross-pollination: S2-3 adopted the "already resolved" view from S1-2, while S2-2 and S2-4 converged on the forward-looking view from S1-3 and S1-4. This created the bimodal distribution (28/28/58/98/99) that drives the extreme 71pp spread.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly identified the resolution criteria: "Yes if, before April 1, 2026, the House passes a resolution censuring, expelling or reprimanding a sitting Representative."
- All correctly identified the 49-day remaining window from forecast date.
- **Critical divergence:** The ensemble split on whether "before April 1, 2026" includes events before the question opened (Feb 11, 2026). S1-2/S1-5/S2-3/S2-5 read the criteria literally (any event before April 1, 2026 counts); S1-1/S1-3/S1-4/S2-2/S2-4 read it as forward-looking (only events from Feb 11 onward).
- **None addressed the fine print:** The fine print states this question is synced with an original identical question (post 40852) that opened on 2025-11-25. This is critical context — the original question opened before Al Green's March 2025 censure... but wait, Green was censured March 6, 2025, which is *after* the original question opened (Nov 25, 2025 is the *synced* opening, and the original post 40852 presumably opened earlier). The fine print's annulment clause adds further complexity that no forecaster analyzed.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Al Green was censured March 6, 2025 (224-198 vote) — confirmed by official House records
2. 5 censures occurred from 2021-2025 (Gosar, Schiff, Tlaib, Bowman, Green) — unprecedented acceleration
3. Multiple pending cases exist (Mills under Ethics investigation, Cherfilus-McCormick facing expulsion resolution)
4. Privileged resolution rule allows any member to force floor vote within 2 legislative days
5. Beyer-Bacon reform proposal seeks 60% threshold (29 co-sponsors, not yet passed)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1 | Internal contradiction | States Green censure "satisfies the question criteria" then reverses to treat question as forward-looking | High — undermines analytical coherence |
| S1-4 | Unverifiable statistic | References "Smarkets" betting market for 2018 bill — actually referencing Israel question's S1-4, not present here | N/A — wrong assessment reference |
| Agent report | Vote tally discrepancy | Lists Mills censure referral as "310-303" in one source and "310-103" in another | Low — both confirm the referral passed |
| AskNews | TIME article misattribution | TIME article describes García as "successfully censured" in November 2025, but García received a "disapproval" not a formal censure — the distinction matters for resolution | Med |

### Hallucinations

No significant hallucinations detected. The Agent report's legislative ledger is well-sourced from Clerk roll-calls and major media. The factual backbone (Green censure, November 2025 censure attempts, pending resolutions) is consistent across all sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research quality:** The Agent report produced a comprehensive, well-sourced ledger of all 119th Congress discipline resolutions — the best single artifact in the forecast. The history.house.gov scraping provided authoritative base rate data.
2. **Strong individual reasoning:** Within each interpretive camp, the analysis is well-structured. The forward-looking forecasters (S2-2, S2-4) converged on 28% through independent Poisson modeling with similar adjustment logic. The literal-reading forecasters (S2-3, S2-5) correctly identified and verified the Al Green precedent.
3. **Good calibration discipline:** Most forecasters provided explicit base rate calculations, consistency checks, timeframe sensitivity analysis, and blind spot identification. The calibration checklists were completed meaningfully.

### Weaknesses
1. **Bimodal split on criteria interpretation destroys aggregation value:** The 62.2% average is not a meaningful probability estimate — it reflects an unresolved interpretive disagreement, not genuine uncertainty. A trimmed mean or median would be 58% (still representing S2-1's compromised reasoning), while the correct approach would be to resolve the interpretation first.
2. **No forecaster analyzed the synced-question fine print:** The fine print explicitly states this question is synced with post 40852 (opened Nov 25, 2025) and includes an annulment clause. This context was critical for resolving the interpretation question but was ignored by all five forecasters.
3. **S2-1 occupies an incoherent middle ground:** Forecaster 1's 58% represents neither full acceptance of the Green precedent (which would yield ~98%) nor a pure forward-looking estimate (which would yield ~28%). The analysis notes Green "does NOT satisfy the resolution criteria" but then doesn't explain why the base rate should start at 52%.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: C+**

The research pipeline performed well, surfacing the critical Al Green precedent and a comprehensive legislative ledger. Individual forecasters produced sound analysis *within their chosen interpretive frameworks*. However, the fundamental disagreement on resolution criteria interpretation — the single most important analytical question — was never resolved, producing a bimodal ensemble with an incoherent average. The 71pp spread and the absence of any engagement with the synced-question fine print further reduce confidence in the final output. The grade reflects strong components undermined by a critical aggregation failure.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- For questions with synced/original question references in the fine print, add a research query specifically targeting the original question's opening date and resolution history.
- The AskNews quota failure should trigger a fallback mechanism (additional Google News queries or alternative API).
- AskNews query relevance was poor — most returned articles were about foreign legislatures or unrelated topics. Consider more restrictive query formulation with explicit "U.S. House of Representatives" qualifiers.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Critical:** When resolution criteria contain temporal language ("before X date") without an explicit start date, the forecasting prompt should include guidance on interpretation. A brief instruction like "Note: this question opened on [date]. Consider whether events before the opening date may satisfy the criteria based on the literal wording" would force all forecasters to address this.
- **Bimodal detection:** The aggregation step should detect bimodal distributions (e.g., two clusters separated by >30pp) and flag them as potentially reflecting interpretive disagreement rather than genuine uncertainty. Consider adding a pre-aggregation step that checks for bimodality and routes to a resolution-criteria-analysis prompt.
- **Fine print analysis:** The prompt should explicitly instruct forecasters to read and analyze the fine print, especially synced-question clauses and annulment conditions.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Split interpretation — S1-1/S2-1 chose forward-looking, S1-2 chose literal. S2-2 produced the strongest forward-looking analysis with excellent calendar constraint reasoning. S2-1's 58% middle ground was analytically incoherent.
- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** Strongest Poisson methodology for base rate but failed to address the Green precedent until S2, when it fully adopted the literal reading from cross-pollination. The swing from 17.8% → 99% shows the model is highly responsive to cross-pollinated framing.
- **o3 (Forecasters 4-5):** Clean, consistent reasoning in both interpretive directions. S2-4 converged with S2-2 at 28% (forward-looking); S2-5 maintained 98% (literal reading). Both showed strong analytical discipline within their frameworks.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp (binary) | Yes | 71pp spread (28% to 99%) — extreme bimodal distribution |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates are directionally consistent within their interpretive frameworks |
| Factual errors present | No | Core facts (Green censure, pending resolutions) are accurate across all outputs |
| Hallucinations detected | No | No significant fabricated claims |
| Cross-pollination effective | Mixed | Transmitted interpretive frameworks effectively but amplified the bimodal split |
| Critical info missed in research | Yes | Synced-question fine print analysis; Metaculus resolution practices |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | Both camps (Poisson ~18% and fact-verification ~99%) are internally valid |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | Bimodal distribution means "outlier" is not a meaningful concept here — it's two distinct clusters |
