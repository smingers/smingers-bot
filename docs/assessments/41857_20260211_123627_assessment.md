# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Wide ensemble spread (31pp) | High | Aggregation | S2 outputs range from 8% to 39%, suggesting fundamental disagreement on how to weight coalition momentum vs. structural barriers |
| Forecaster 5 (o3) significantly overweights momentum signals | High | S2-5 | Applies multiplicative adjustments (×1.9, ×1.7, ×1.3) to momentum indicators, producing 39% — an outlier that pulls the final average up substantially |
| Agent report contains unverifiable details | Med | Research | Agent report cites specific bill numbers (e.g., "Government Bill 1203/20/P") and attributes (e.g., "IDI briefing, 29 Jan 2018") that cannot be independently verified and may be hallucinated |
| AskNews deep research failed (quota exceeded) | Med | Research | AskNews deep research returned error "ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded," reducing current-event coverage |
| Forecaster 3 (GPT-5.2) uses questionable reference class | Med | S1-3 | Selects "controversial security legislation" as primary base rate (~35%) rather than anchoring on the narrower and more relevant 0/3 death penalty bill base rate |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (1 query, 2 steps) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (but deep research failed: quota exceeded) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No (not relevant) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not relevant) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No (not relevant) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (2 of 5 URLs scraped successfully; 3 Knesset URLs failed) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "Israeli death penalty terrorists bill history" (Google) — 3 results
2. "Knesset second reading death penalty bill" (Google News) — 3 results
3. Agent query requesting full legislative timeline of all death penalty bill attempts since 2015 (Agent) — 1 comprehensive report, 2 agentic steps with 5 sub-queries

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "Penal Bill death penalty terrorists Knesset" (Google) — 3 results
2. "Israel death penalty for terrorists bill" (Google News) — 3 results
3. AskNews query on latest February 2026 developments and passage chances (AskNews) — 18 articles returned; deep research failed (403 quota error)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Pre-2026 legislative history, prior bill attempts | Jan-Feb 2026 developments, committee status |
| Content type | Legislative chronology, vote tallies, failure reasons | Committee hearings, prison preparations, expert objections |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Base rate establishment (0/3 prior bills enacted), coalition dynamics history | Current committee status, Defense Ministry objections, "far from final approval" signal |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries properly target base rate establishment through legislative history. Current queries surface recent decision-relevant events (committee delays, prison preparations, expert objections).
- The Agent query was particularly effective, producing a detailed legislative timeline covering 2015, 2018, 2023, and 2025 attempts with vote tallies and failure reasons. This became the backbone of outside view analysis across all forecasters.
- The AskNews deep research failure (quota exceeded) is a moderate gap — it would have provided a more curated synthesis of current developments. However, the standard AskNews results (18 articles) partially compensated.
- Google and Google News queries are somewhat overlapping ("Israeli death penalty terrorists bill history" vs. "Knesset second reading death penalty bill"), but this is acceptable given the different result types (web pages vs. news articles).
- **Critical gap:** No query specifically targeted Haredi party positions or coalition whip counts in February 2026. This information proved to be the decisive factor in forecaster analyses but was inferred from older sources rather than directly surfaced.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report appropriately concludes with "Implications for the forecasting question" but frames this as analytical observations rather than explicit probability estimates. It identifies the key variables (Haredi veto, coalition arithmetic, committee speed) without stating a probability. This is appropriate — research informs rather than forecasts.

The AskNews articles are factual news reports that do not offer explicit forecasts. The i24NEWS article's statement that the bill is "far from final approval" is an editorial assessment rather than a forecast, and forecasters appropriately treated it as evidence.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Complete legislative history of 4 prior death penalty bill attempts (all failed)
  - Current committee status (still in review after 92 days since first reading)
  - Coalition arithmetic (64 seats, need 61, Haredi 18 seats at risk)
  - i24NEWS (Feb 9) "far from final approval" assessment
  - Prison Service preparations (execution facility under construction)
  - Defense Ministry and legal expert objections (Feb 11)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Current Haredi party positions as of February 2026 (inferred from Jan 23 Verfassungsblog)
  - Whether any second reading date has been formally scheduled
  - Knesset winter session calendar and pre-Passover recess timing (only Forecaster 5 mentioned this)

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: High quality — BBC, CNN, Le Monde, Times of Israel, Jerusalem Post, Al Jazeera all provided factual legislative details
  - Agent report: Very good synthesis of legislative history; some unverifiable citations (bill numbers, specific IDI briefing dates) but directionally accurate and consistent with press record
  - AskNews articles: Mixed quality — 18 articles provided broad coverage but many were redundant (same story in different languages/outlets); the deportation/citizenship stories were tangentially relevant at best; deep research failure reduced value

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all 9 sources with quality ratings, opinion vs. fact distinctions, and recency assessment. Correctly identifies Agent report's key insight that no death penalty bill has ever passed beyond first reading.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 reference classes and selects "bills requiring Haredi support in current coalition" as most relevant. This is a strong choice that directly addresses the binding constraint. Also considers the 0/4 base rate as anchor.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Precisely calculates 48-day window; compares against 92 days already elapsed since first reading. Notes 2018 bill stalled for 11 months, 2023 bill frozen in 3 months.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear probabilistic calculation: 20% chance of resolving Haredi opposition × 40% passage if resolved + 80% unresolved × 5% = 12%. Then adjusts to 13%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 13% probability through conditional probability framework
- Considers both Yes pathway (Haredi capitulation + fast scheduling) and No pathway (stalling)
- The conditional probability approach is methodologically strong

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation similar to S1-1, with proper opinion/fact distinction. Notes Verfassungsblog's 19-day age as relevant recency marker.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 reference classes including the key "Haredi defection" class. Chooses combination of death penalty bill history + coalition arithmetic as "most suitable."
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 48-day window. Good comparison: 2018 stalled 10 months, 2023 frozen 3 months. Notes 3 months elapsed without second reading scheduled.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchors on 0/4 = 0% base rate, adjusts upward for unprecedented first reading passage and security establishment shift, arrives at 12%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 12% through qualitative adjustment from 0% base
- Less rigorous than S1-1's conditional framework but reaches similar conclusion
- Appropriately weights historical failure pattern

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Most detailed per-source analysis of all five outputs. Correctly identifies Agent report as "directionally informative rather than authoritative." Distinguishes Channel 12's assessment as "speculative/analyst view, not a legislative fact."
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 reference classes. Uses Laplace smoothing on 0/3 base rate to get 20% — a reasonable statistical technique for tiny samples. Acknowledges need to adjust for tight deadline.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 7-week window. Notes the bill has already sat for months, signaling "unresolved coalition, legal, or prioritization issues." Good heuristic: "eventual passage" ~20% → "pass by deadline" = half to two-thirds of that.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Arrives at 18.6% using Laplace-smoothed anchor (~20%) with deadline discount. This is the highest S1 estimate.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 18.6% — methodologically sound with Laplace smoothing but arguably over-generous. The broader "controversial security bills" reference class pulls the estimate up relative to death-penalty-specific base rate.
- The choice to use a broader reference class is debatable — it dilutes the signal from 0/3 specific failures.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but adequate. Correctly categorizes sources and notes Channel 12's High Court assessment as speculative.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Most aggressive choice — selects "highly controversial security-civil-rights bills that clear first reading" with ~35% base rate. This is the weakest reference class selection because it underweights the death-penalty-specific 0/3 record. The 35% is a rough estimate without strong sourcing.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Calculates 49 days remaining. Notes median time for coalition security bills from first to final reading is 90-100 days, with fastest at 12-15 days. Good observation that 92 days post-first reading means slower than fast-track median.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from 35% base, applies +/-adjustments to reach 27%. References "Smarkets" betting market for 2018 bill as cross-check (peaked at ~20%), but this reference is unverifiable and possibly hallucinated.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 27% — the highest S1 estimate. The primary driver is the aggressive 35% base rate from a loosely defined reference class.
- The betting market cross-check is a good idea in principle but the specific claim is unverifiable.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Adequate but briefer than others. Correctly identifies key sources and limitations.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses multiple classes but anchors on "high-salience/controversial security bills" (~45% base rate) — even broader than S1-4's choice. Then applies short-window factor (×0.35) and death-penalty-specific discount (×0.8) to get 13%.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Identifies 50-day window. Notes Knesset statistics suggest only 30-35% of security bills clear both readings inside two months. This statistical claim is unverifiable but plausible.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Multi-step calculation: 45% × 0.35 (short window) × 0.8 (death penalty discount) = 12.6%, rounded to 13%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derives 13% through multiplicative discounting — methodologically sound
- The starting base rate (45%) is arguably too high but the aggressive discounts bring it to a reasonable final figure
- Considers both pathways appropriately

- **Score:** 12/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 13% | 14/16 | Conditional probability framework with Haredi veto as binding constraint | Could have explored opposition vote pickup scenario |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 12% | 13/16 | Strong historical pattern recognition, clear weighted factors | Less rigorous derivation than S1-1 |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 18.6% | 12/16 | Laplace smoothing technique for small samples | Broader reference class pulls estimate higher than warranted |
| S1-4 | o3 | 27% | 11/16 | Betting market cross-check attempt (good idea) | Aggressive 35% base rate from loosely defined reference class |
| S1-5 | o3 | 13% | 12/16 | Multi-step multiplicative discounting is transparent | Starting base rate (45%) too high but compensated by discounts |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Prediction |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 13% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 27% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 12% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 18.6% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3) | 13% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1 (13%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Identifies 5 strong evidence items (legislative status confirmed, 92-day delay, "far from final approval," prison preparations, committee hearings). Properly distinguishes factual from advocacy content.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 13% → Output: 8%, Δ = -5%. Justifies downward movement with: 92 days elapsed without scheduling, i24NEWS "far from final approval," internal government legal opposition, and time remaining shorter than time elapsed.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — notes halving to 24 days drops to 3-5%, doubling to 96 days increases to 20-25%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed meaningfully. Blind spot scenario (Ben-Gvir forcing emergency coalition vote) is plausible. Status quo analysis supports low probability. Consistency check: "8 out of 100 times" passes — reasonable.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction matches evidence direction (negative developments → lower probability)
- Final probability (8%) is internally consistent with reasoning about structural impossibility of resolving Haredi opposition + scheduling in 48 days

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4 (27%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Identifies severe time constraint as strong evidence against. Correctly notes procedural delay (92 days in committee, 49 remaining) as structural evidence.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 27% → Output: 14%, Δ = -13%. Large downward adjustment driven by: procedural delay, internal coalition opposition (Defense Ministry), zero historical successes. Transparent calculation: 27% - 10% - 5% - 3% + 2% = 11%, then recalibrates to 14%.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halving to 25 days = near-zero (5-8%); doubling to 98 days = 35-40%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot scenario well-articulated (emergency coalition crisis forcing immediate vote). Status quo analysis supports non-passage. Consistency check: "14 out of 100 times" reasonable.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction correct (new negative information → lower probability)
- Appropriately adjusts down from S1-4's higher starting point
- The -13pp adjustment is well-justified by the evidence cited

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2 (12%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured evidence analysis with explicit Strong/Moderate/Weak categorization. Good balance between positive (fast-tracking, prison preparations, coalition support) and negative (time constraint, no plenum date, institutional objections) signals.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 12% → Output: 22%, Δ = +10%. Upward adjustment driven by: fast-tracking signals, operational preparations, stable governing majority, Netanyahu's endorsement. Applies multiplicative adjustments to reach low-to-mid 20s.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halving to 24-25 days drops "materially," doubling to 98 days would raise "materially."
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot identified (sudden coalition "jam through" in late-March session). Status quo analysis notes "delay beyond April 1" is most likely outcome.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction is upward (+10pp) despite predominantly negative evidence — this is the weakest aspect. The rationale is that momentum indicators (fast-tracking, preparations) warrant an upward revision, but the evidence also shows the fast-tracking has stalled (23 days since Adalah reported hearings, still no completion).
- The tension between "status quo is delay" acknowledgment and +10pp upward shift is not fully resolved.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 (18.6%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but well-structured. Key evidence bullets are excellent (≤20 words each). Correctly identifies coalition arithmetic, Netanyahu support, committee fast-tracking, no plenum date, and legal establishment warnings.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 18.6% → Output: 23%, Δ = +4.4%. Modest upward adjustment: +6% (coalition demand) + 4% (fast-tracking/sponsor rhetoric) - 3% (legal resistance) - 2% (tight calendar/no date). Clean arithmetic.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halving to 25 days drops to ~11%, doubling to 100 days rises to ~37%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot (major terror attack prompting emergency session) is creative and plausible. Status-quo bias check notes "No" is default. Consistency: "23 times out of 100" passes.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Modest upward shift (+4.4pp) is reasonable given the mix of positive and negative signals
- Clean, transparent arithmetic
- Update magnitude is proportional to evidence strength

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5 (13%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured as Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Identifies coalition size and accelerated hearings as strong evidence for passage; notes counter-pressures are "mostly soft-power or advisory." This underweights the Haredi veto risk and Defense Ministry opposition.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 13% → Output: 39%, Δ = +26%. Very large upward adjustment via multiplicative factors: 13% × 1.9 × 1.7 × 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.8 × 0.9 ≈ 39%. The multiplicative approach amplifies momentum signals disproportionately.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halving to 24 days = ~25%; doubling to 98 days = ~60%. Both seem high.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot (security establishment veto forcing Netanyahu to shelve) is good. Status-quo acknowledged (No-pass at 61%), but 39% still seems over-confident for a bill in committee for 92 days with no second reading scheduled.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The +26pp upward shift is the largest in the ensemble and is not well-supported by the evidence
- Multiplicative approach creates compounding: three positive multipliers (×1.9, ×1.7, ×1.3 = combined ×4.2) far outweigh three negative multipliers (×0.7, ×0.8, ×0.9 = combined ×0.504), producing net ×2.1
- The "sanity check" that "about two in five" feels right is inadequately justified given that (a) 0 of 4 prior attempts succeeded, (b) bill has been in committee 92 days, (c) no second reading scheduled, and (d) i24NEWS explicitly says "far from final approval"
- This is the clear outlier pulling the ensemble average up

- **Score:** 9/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 13% | 8% | -5% | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 27% | 14% | -13% | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 12% | 22% | +10% | 11/16 | Partial — upward shift despite predominantly negative new evidence |
| S2-4 | o3 | 18.6% | 23% | +4.4% | 13/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 13% | 39% | +26% | 9/16 | No — magnitude not supported by evidence; multiplicative approach amplifies bias |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4/o3's 27%):** Engaged meaningfully with the higher outside view and substantially corrected it downward to 14%. This is the best example of cross-pollination working — the higher S1 input was critically evaluated against current evidence and appropriately discounted. Cross-pollination added value by preventing S2-2 from anchoring too low.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2/Sonnet 4.5's 12%):** Updated upward to 22% from the 12% input. The +10pp shift shows engagement with the base rate but the direction is questionable given the weight of negative current evidence. Cross-pollination may have paradoxically caused this instance to "overcorrect" upward from a low input.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3/GPT-5.2's 18.6%):** Modest +4.4pp adjustment to 23%. Reasonable engagement with the cross-pollinated input — neither over-anchored nor over-corrected.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1 receiving S1-1, S2-5 receiving S1-5):** Both started at 13%. S2-1 moved to 8% (reasonable downward shift); S2-5 moved to 39% (dramatic upward shift). The divergence shows that same-model cross-pollination does not create consensus — model and instance personality dominate.

- **Did cross-pollination increase diversity?** Yes — S2-2's correction from 27% to 14% actually reduced diversity relative to S1, while S2-5's dramatic expansion from 13% to 39% increased it. Net effect: diversity increased, but primarily due to one outlier rather than genuine analytical disagreement.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (bill must pass second and third readings and become law per the Knesset website before April 1, 2026 UTC).
- All correctly identified the 48-49 day forecast timeframe.
- All correctly assessed current status: bill passed first reading Nov 11, 2025; still in National Security Committee as of Feb 11, 2026.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. First reading passed 39-16 on November 11, 2025
2. Bill still in committee after 92 days with no second reading scheduled
3. Coalition holds 64/120 seats; 61 needed for passage
4. Historical precedent: 0 of 3-4 prior death penalty bills became law
5. Netanyahu reversed opposition after hostage crisis ended

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 (o3) | Unverifiable claim | References "Smarkets" betting market for 2018 bill peaking at ~20% — no source available to verify | Low |
| S1-4 (o3) | Questionable statistic | Claims "roughly 1 in 4 controversial security bills expected to pass nevertheless fail late" — no source cited | Medium |
| S1-5 (o3) | Unverifiable statistic | Claims "of security-related government bills that eventually became law, only about 30-35% cleared both remaining readings inside a two-month window" citing "Knesset legislative statistics 2019-24" — cannot be verified | Medium |
| Agent report | Specific bill numbers | Cites "Government Bill 1203/20/P" for 2018 draft with caveat "not quoted in press but appears in committee dockets" — likely hallucinated | Low |
| S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | Imprecise claim | States "pass rate ≈80%" for "all government bills that clear first reading" — reasonable but unsourced estimate | Low |

### Hallucinations

The Agent report's citation of specific bill numbers and attribution to particular databases ("Knesset Bill Book") may be fabricated, though the report itself acknowledges these gaps ("only partial press references are available"). The o3 instances (S1-4, S1-5) cite plausible-sounding statistics about Knesset legislative success rates that cannot be independently verified. None of these significantly affect the forecasts since the core analysis doesn't depend on them.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research pipeline:** The combination of historical search, agentic research, and current news produced a rich, well-structured information base. The Agent report on legislative history was particularly valuable and directly informed all forecasters.
2. **Strong source analysis across the board:** All five forecasters demonstrated ability to distinguish fact from opinion, evaluate source quality, and identify the most decision-relevant information.
3. **Correct identification of binding constraint:** Four of five forecasters correctly identified the Haredi veto / coalition arithmetic problem as the critical obstacle, which is the key analytical insight for this question.
4. **Appropriate methodology:** The outside view → inside view pipeline worked well. Forecasters anchored on base rates and then updated with current evidence, maintaining analytical discipline.

### Weaknesses
1. **Forecaster 5 outlier pulls aggregate:** The 39% prediction is poorly justified and inflates the final average by ~5pp. A median or trimmed mean would have produced ~22% (between S2-3 and S2-4), arguably a better estimate.
2. **Reference class disagreement is unresolved:** S1 outputs use bases ranging from 0% (death-penalty-specific) to 45% (broad security bills). The template correctly notes this creates the wide spread, but the pipeline has no mechanism to adjudicate between reference classes.
3. **Current Haredi position underinvestigated:** The most critical variable (Haredi party stance) relies on 19-day-old information from Verfassungsblog. No forecaster flagged this as a research gap warranting additional investigation.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

The research quality is strong (borderline A-tier), factual accuracy is high, and four of five forecasters produce well-reasoned, defensible estimates. The grade is pulled down from B+ by: (1) the Forecaster 5 outlier significantly affecting the final average, (2) the wide 31pp ensemble spread suggesting insufficient convergence mechanisms, and (3) the missed opportunity to investigate the Haredi position more thoroughly.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add a query specifically targeting coalition whip counts and party positions for the current Knesset session when questions involve Israeli legislation. Haredi party positioning was the critical variable but was not directly researched in the current search phase.
- The AskNews quota failure should trigger a fallback mechanism — perhaps an additional Google News query or alternative news API.
- Consider adding a "Knesset official schedule" check tool for legislative questions to determine if plenum dates have been set.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Consider implementing trimmed mean or median aggregation instead of simple average. A trimmed mean excluding the highest and lowest would have produced ~20% (average of 14%, 22%, 23%) — removing the 8% and 39% outliers.
- The wide S1 spread (12% to 27%) could be reduced by providing more structured guidance on reference class selection — e.g., preferring narrow, domain-specific reference classes over broad ones.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Consistently strong, disciplined analysis with well-justified probabilities. The best-performing models in this forecast.
- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** Good analytical framework (Laplace smoothing) but the inside view update direction was questionable — moving upward despite predominantly negative evidence. May benefit from stronger prompting to justify update direction against evidence weight.
- **o3 (Forecasters 4-5):** Mixed results. S1-4/S2-4 produced reasonable analysis with a modest upward shift. S1-5/S2-5 produced the outlier 39% via multiplicative amplification of momentum signals. The multiplicative approach needs guardrails — perhaps cap adjustments at ±15pp from the outside view unless extraordinary evidence warrants more.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp (binary) | Yes | 31pp spread (8% to 39%) |
