# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Resolution criteria ambiguity | Medium | S1-3, S1-5 | S1-3 (gpt-5.2) explicitly noted that research sources sometimes refer to LDP+coalition seats rather than LDP-alone seats, creating interpretive confusion. S1-5 (o3) made a similar observation. This is a legitimate concern about research quality. |
| Large Step 1 spread | Low | S1 Outputs | Step 1 predictions ranged from 42-71% (29pp spread), though this narrowed substantially by Step 2 (65-79%, 14pp). Diversity in outside view is acceptable. |
| No major critical issues | - | - | Overall, this was a well-executed forecast with strong research, coherent reasoning, and appropriate calibration given available evidence. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. LDP historical seat totals elections (Google)
2. Japan poll Liberal Democratic majority 2026 (Google News)
3. Provide latest January 2026 Japanese national polls, any reputable seat projections for Feb 8 snap election, and summarize LDP performance in 1993, 2009, 2024 general elections. Explain Japan's mixed electoral system's impact on translating vote share to seats. (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. 2026 Japan election opinion polls (Google)
2. LDP majority projections 2026 election (Google News)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Long-run electoral patterns, 1993/2009/2024 precedents | Late January 2026 polls and projections |
| Content type | Base rates, electoral system mechanics, scandal-election patterns | Seat projections, undecided voter %, coalition dynamics |
| Unique contribution | Reference class establishment, structural understanding | Real-time polling consensus, campaign momentum |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets were appropriately discrete: historical queries focused on establishing base rates and understanding Japan's electoral mechanics, while current queries targeted specific 2026 seat projections.
- Historical queries successfully surfaced the 1993, 2009, and 2024 failure cases, providing excellent reference class material.
- Current queries captured the critical Kyodo, Yomiuri/Nikkei, JNN, Mainichi, and Asahi polls from January 27-30, 2026.
- The agentic search query was particularly comprehensive, requesting electoral system mechanics alongside polling data.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs appropriately remained factual. The AskNews deep research analysis included a "conclusion" section stating LDP is "favored to win," but this was clearly labeled as synthesis of polling data rather than an independent probability estimate. The Agent report similarly compiled findings without imposing a probability.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Five independent late-January seat projections (Kyodo, Yomiuri/Nikkei, JNN, Mainichi, Asahi)
  - Historical base rates (LDP majority in 8/11 post-1993 elections)
  - Critical structural factor: LDP-Komeito coalition dissolved October 2025
  - Undecided voter percentages (20-50% across polls)
  - PM Takaichi approval ratings (60-78%)
  - LDP party approval (~30%)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Nothing major; research was comprehensive

- **Source quality:** Excellent. Multiple high-quality Japanese polling organizations (Kyodo, Yomiuri, Nikkei, NHK, Mainichi, Asahi), reputable think tanks (CFR), and reliable international outlets (CNBC, Nikkei Asia).

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion | Good but incomplete | Superficial | Missing |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class | Missing |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines patterns | Mostly correct | Significant gaps | Missing |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation, mathematically sound | Minor issues | Significant errors | Missing |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Evaluated 7 sources individually, noted NHK's 224k sample size, distinguished fact from opinion, identified Kyodo as "gold-standard." (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 5 candidate classes, evaluated each for suitability, selected "Recent LDP performance (2024-2025) combined with post-scandal elections." Good but could have been more quantitative. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 7-day window, noted 20% undecided voters, referenced October 2024 polling underperformance. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Did not provide explicit historical base rate calculation. Derived 52% through qualitative weighing of factors. (2/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probability: 52% - conservative given polling consensus
- Considered both Yes (Kyodo projection, Takaichi popularity, electoral mechanics) and No (Komeito loss, weak party support, recent losses) pathways

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Very thorough. Analyzed 7 sources with quality ratings, distinguished fact from opinion, noted specific sample sizes and methodologies. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 5 classes, evaluated each systematically, chose hybrid approach combining recent performance with snap election precedents. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 7 days, analyzed Takaichi's 4-month tenure vs Ishiba's 1-month, noted coalition realignment recency. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Excellent quantitative work. Started from 2024 baseline (LDP 191 seats), calculated path to 233 via 170 SMDs + 60 PR seats, derived 65-72% probability range. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probability: Implied 65-72% range (Step 1 did not give explicit final number but analysis suggests this range)
- Strong consideration of both pathways with mathematical seat arithmetic

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (gpt-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Good evaluation of 7 sources, correctly noted Mezha is secondary relay of Kyodo, flagged "key mismatch" between coalition projections and LDP-alone resolution criteria. Critical insight. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes (post-1996 elections, post-failure rebounds, ~30% vote share translations), selected Reference Class 1 as primary. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 7-day window, noted structural forces matter more than late news shocks in short windows. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 70-80% historical base rate, adjusted down 25-35pp for recent underperformance and Komeito loss, arriving at 43%. Clear methodology. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probability: 43% - most conservative of all outputs
- Importantly highlighted that Kyodo projects LDP+Ishin coalition, not LDP alone, which is the actual resolution criterion

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive. Analyzed all sources systematically, categorized as polling sources vs expert commentary vs structural analysis. Correctly identified Kyodo ±15 seat historical accuracy. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Class 1 (post-1955 elections, 19/26 majorities = 73%), Class 2 (post-setback rebounds, 2/2 = 100%), Class 3 (without Komeito, 16/20 = 80%). Strong quantitative grounding. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Noted ±12 seat average final-week error from Kyodo series 2003-2021. Correctly stated 7-day window. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear arithmetic: 73% base - 5% for Komeito loss + 3% for leader approval = 71%. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probability: 71%
- Excellent quantitative derivation with clear adjustments

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all sources, correctly noted Kyodo's ±15 seat historical accuracy, identified IPU as "archival, numerically solid." (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three classes analyzed: (a) 11 post-1993 elections (8/11 = 73%), (b) post-setback rebounds (2/2), (c) elections without Komeito. Adopted (a) as primary. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Noted last-week national polling error averages ±12 seats. Correctly stated threshold proximity makes this margin significant. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Same 73% baseline as S1-4, but applied larger adjustments: -20% for sub-30% vote intention, -10% for Komeito loss, +5% for Kyodo seat model, -5% for undecided voters = 43%. Very different from S1-4 despite same methodology. (3/4 - the large downward adjustments are arguably excessive)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probability: 42%
- Conservative estimate driven by concern about vote intention levels

- **Score:** 15/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 52% | 13/16 | Comprehensive source analysis | Lacked explicit base rate calculation |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~67%* | 15/16 | Excellent seat arithmetic | Slightly less structured presentation |
| S1-3 | gpt-5.2 | 43% | 14/16 | Identified LDP-alone vs coalition ambiguity | Potentially over-weighted structural concerns |
| S1-4 | o3 | 71% | 16/16 | Best quantitative derivation | May under-weight polling uncertainty |
| S1-5 | o3 | 42% | 15/16 | Strong historical base rate analysis | Large downward adjustments may be excessive |

*S1-2 didn't give explicit probability but analysis implied 65-72% range

**Notable observation:** The two o3 instances (S1-4 and S1-5) arrived at dramatically different probabilities (71% vs 42%) despite using similar reference class methodology. This reflects genuine uncertainty about how to weight recent polling vs structural factors.

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Probability |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 52% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 71% |
| S2-3 | gpt-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~67% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (gpt-5.2) | 43% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 42% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Correctly categorized evidence as Strong (polling convergence, structural advantages), Moderate (undecided voters, recent decline, Komeito loss), Weak (economic dissatisfaction, weather). (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 52% → Output: 65%, Δ = +13%. Justified by polling consensus across 5 organizations. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed timeframe explicitly: 7 days → current probability; 3-4 days → ~65-70% (less volatility); 14 days → ~45-50% (more uncertainty). (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and meaningful. Paraphrased resolution criteria, stated base rate, consistency check ("65 out of 100 times"), top evidence, blind spot (late scandal/gaffe), status quo consideration. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (upward) matched evidence direction (polling consensus) - correct
- Final probability internally consistent with stated reasoning

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applied Strong/Moderate/Weak framework correctly. Five independent polls as strong evidence, undecided voters and structural headwinds as moderate. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 71% → Output: 79%, Δ = +8%. Justified by "unprecedented polling convergence." (3/4 - the upward adjustment from an already high base may be slightly aggressive)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addressed halved (75-78%) and doubled (65-68%) timeframes. (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. "79 out of 100 times" consistency check, identified blind spot (coordinated opposition surge in final 48 hours). (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction correct but magnitude may be slightly high
- 79% is the highest prediction in the ensemble

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (gpt-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong evidence: convergent polling (5 outlets), structural advantages. Moderate: undecided voters 30-46%, Komeito defection. Used framework appropriately. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~67% → Output: 71%, Δ = +4%. Small update reflecting polling convergence. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved (tighter, +1pp) and doubled (wider, +/-3pp) scenarios. (3/4 - somewhat brief)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. "71 out of 100 times," key evidence listed, blind spot (late-breaking turnout/coordination shock). (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Appropriate small update from already-favorable outside view
- Internally consistent reasoning

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: consistent seat projections, structural advantage, Takaichi approval. Moderate: undecided voters, recent losses. Weak: pundit skepticism, weather. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 43% → Output: 68%, Δ = +25%. Large update justified by "four independent late-Jan national seat projections" shifting from outside view. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halving (reduces uncertainty +1pp) and doubling (widens +/-3pp). (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. "68 out of 100 times," top evidence listed, blind spot (coordinated tactical voting by Soka Gakkai). (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Large update is justified given the significant gap between outside view (43%) and current polling consensus
- The 25pp shift is appropriate given the strong new evidence

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: five independent polls showing 233-245 seats, 60% approval. Moderate: 30-46% undecided, Komeito loss. Well-structured. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 42% → Output: 65%, Δ = +23%. Large update from Monte Carlo simulation (mean 240, σ 15 gives 69%, discounted to 55%, then rounded to 65%). (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed in limited detail ("7 days... very little time for structural parameters to change"). (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. "65 out of 100 times," explicit base rate comparison (42% outside, 65% inside), blind spot (Soka Gakkai tactical voting in metro areas). (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Strong quantitative approach with Monte Carlo framing
- Large update from very conservative outside view is well-justified

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 52% | 65% | +13% | 16/16 | Yes - polling consensus |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 71% | 79% | +8% | 15/16 | Partial - may be slightly aggressive |
| S2-3 | gpt-5.2 | ~67% | 71% | +4% | 15/16 | Yes - modest update from strong base |
| S2-4 | o3 | 43% | 68% | +25% | 15/16 | Yes - large correction from conservative outside view |
| S2-5 | o3 | 42% | 65% | +23% | 15/16 | Yes - large correction with Monte Carlo justification |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):**
  - S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's 71%): Engaged meaningfully, raised prediction to 79% after validating polling convergence
  - S2-3 (gpt-5.2 receiving Sonnet's ~67%): Made modest +4% adjustment, appropriate given similar starting point
  - S2-4 (o3 receiving gpt-5.2's 43%): Made large +25% correction, recognizing the conservative outside view needed significant updating

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):**
  - S2-1 (Sonnet receiving Sonnet's 52%): +13% update to 65%
  - S2-5 (o3 receiving o3's 42%): +23% update to 65%

- **Cross-pollination effectiveness:** Good. The cross-model instances engaged substantively with received inputs. Notably, S2-4 (o3 receiving gpt-5.2's conservative 43%) made a large justified correction, while S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's 71%) made a smaller but still meaningful adjustment.

- **Diversity impact:** Cross-pollination moderately reduced diversity. Step 1 spread was 42-71% (29pp), while Step 2 spread was 65-79% (14pp). The convergence toward 65-71% reflects appropriate updating on strong polling consensus.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **Resolution criteria:** All instances correctly understood: LDP needs ≥233 of 465 seats (single-party majority). S1-3 specifically noted the distinction between LDP-alone and coalition projections.
- **Forecast timeframe:** All correctly identified 7 days to February 8, 2026 election.
- **Current status:** All correctly noted LDP currently at 196-198 seats, needing ~35-37 seat gain.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. LDP needs 233 of 465 seats for majority
2. Multiple January 2026 polls (Kyodo, Yomiuri/Nikkei, JNN, Mainichi, Asahi) project LDP at or near 233 threshold
3. LDP-Komeito coalition dissolved October 2025; LDP now allied with Ishin
4. PM Takaichi approval 60-78%, LDP party approval ~30%
5. 20-50% of voters remain undecided
6. LDP won only 191 seats in October 2024

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| CNBC source | Minor inconsistency | CNBC cited 456 seats vs 465 actual | Low - agents noted discrepancy |
| Coalition confusion | Ambiguity | Some research sources conflated LDP-alone with LDP+coalition projections | Low - S1-3 and S1-5 caught this |

### Hallucinations

None detected. All factual claims were traceable to the research sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research coverage:** Five independent Japanese polling organizations captured, all from late January 2026
2. **Strong reference class analysis:** Multiple agents constructed appropriate base rates (73% historical majority rate, adjusted for structural factors)
3. **Appropriate convergence:** Step 2 predictions narrowed from 42-71% (Step 1) to 65-79%, reflecting proper updating on polling consensus
4. **Calibration quality:** All agents completed calibration checklists meaningfully, including blind spot identification

### Weaknesses
1. **High Step 2 spread still present:** 14pp spread (65-79%) suggests some residual disagreement on how to weight polling consensus vs structural uncertainties
2. **S2-2 potentially over-confident:** 79% may be too high given 20-50% undecided voters and structural Komeito loss
3. **Some agents over-weighted structural concerns in Step 1:** S1-3 and S1-5 both arrived at ~43%, which the inside view evidence substantially corrected

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: A-**

Strong forecast with excellent research, well-structured reasoning, and appropriate probability calibration. The Step 1 spread was wide but converged appropriately in Step 2. Minor concern about S2-2's 79% being potentially over-confident.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

- None significant. Research was comprehensive and surfaced all key polling sources.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

- Consider adding explicit guidance to distinguish between "coalition" projections and "single-party" projections when the resolution criteria specifies one party only.
- The wide Step 1 spread (29pp) could be addressed by providing more structured base rate templates.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5:** Performed well in both steps. S2-2's 79% was the high outlier - could benefit from stronger anchoring on uncertainty from undecided voters.
- **gpt-5.2:** Provided valuable critical insight about LDP-alone vs coalition ambiguity. Both Step 1 (43%) and Step 2 (71%) were reasonable.
- **o3:** Strong quantitative reasoning with clear base rate derivations. S1-4 and S1-5 arrived at very different conclusions (71% vs 42%) from similar methods, suggesting sensitivity to adjustment choices.
