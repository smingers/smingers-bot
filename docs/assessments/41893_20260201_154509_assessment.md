# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Extraction failure for Agents 1 & 2 | Critical | S2-1 / S2-2 | Both Claude Sonnet 4.5 agents produced complete Step 2 analyses but failed probability extraction - responses were truncated or didn't include final probability block, resulting in only 3/5 agents contributing to aggregation |
| Missing numerical predictions in S2-1 and S2-2 outputs | High | S2-1 / S2-2 | Step 2 responses for agents 1 and 2 appear truncated (agent 1's S2 ends mid-analysis at ~150 lines, agent 2's S2 ends mid-sentence on "Regional analysis opinion (unnamed") |
| Aggregation only used 3 agents | High | Aggregation | Final prediction averaged only agents 3, 4, 5 instead of all 5, reducing ensemble diversity and potentially biasing results toward o3-family models |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Nepal 2026 election opinion poll (Google)
2. Nepali Communist Party merger 2025 reaction (Google News)
3. Opinion polling, by-election results and party alliances for 2026 Nepali general election; comparative seat/vote conversion in 2017 and 2022; impact of 2025 Gen Z protests on party popularity (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. 2026 Nepal election opinion polls (Google)
2. Nepal 2026 election seat projection (Google News)
3. Provide the newest polling, alliances and seat forecast reports for Nepal's 2026 House of Representatives election, highlighting major parties' chances. (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Base rates (2017, 2022 results, merger impacts) | Live campaign/polling data |
| Content type | Electoral system mechanics, seat conversion, protest effects | Polls, projections, alliances |
| Unique contribution | Strong structural grounding | Campaign dynamics, recent events |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets have significant overlap - both target polling data which doesn't exist in Nepal
- Historical queries appropriately included the rich analysis about electoral system mechanics (FPTP vs PR seat conversion), which proved highly valuable
- The agentic search in historical was excellent - produced a comprehensive synthesis of 2017/2022 data and structural factors
- Current queries correctly prioritized recent news but couldn't surface polls (none exist)
- Gap: Queries could have targeted more specific constituency-level reporting or party organizational capacity

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The historical query generator produced a preliminary forecast ("the default outside-view favorite is the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)"), which is somewhat inappropriate. However, agents correctly treated this as one input rather than deferring to it. The AskNews deep research appropriately admitted "I cannot provide the requested polling, alliances, or seat forecasts" - correctly acknowledging data limitations rather than fabricating.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - 2022 election results (NC 89, UML 78, Maoist 32, RSP 20 seats)
  - January 2026 National Assembly results (NC-UML alliance swept, NCP won 0/18 seats)
  - Left merger forming Nepali Communist Party (November 2025)
  - Electoral system mechanics (165 FPTP + 110 PR)
  - No national opinion polling exists
  - 2023 by-election RSP victories
  - Gen Z protest context and Oli resignation

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Could have sought more constituency-level analysis
  - Limited information on party organizational capacity in rural areas
  - No information on candidate quality/recognition metrics

- **Source quality:** High - multiple wire services (Xinhua, Times of India), quality domestic outlets (Kathmandu Post, Nepal News), consistent cross-validation of facts

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent - systematically evaluated each source (The Hindu, Rising Nepal Daily, Xinhua, Nepal News, Grand Pinnacle Tribune, Jacobin, Agent Report) with quality ratings and fact/opinion distinction. Noted Grand Pinnacle Tribune's uncertain quality, Jacobin's ideological bias. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes (Nepal's own elections, post-uprising S. Asian elections, global youth protest elections). Appropriately selected Nepal 2017/2022 as most relevant. Good justification. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 33-day window. Analyzed 2017 alliance formation timing, but could have been more explicit about what changes in 33 days. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear derivation from 2022 seat shares (NC 32%, UML 28%, Left 17%, RSP 7%). Applied adjustments for merger, Gen Z protests, organizational factors. Final: NC 47%, UML 29%, NCP 14%, RSP 7%. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Assigned probabilities to all 8 options
- Probabilities sum to 100%
- Appropriately gave tiny probabilities to minor parties (Ujyaalo 0%, Pragatisheel 0%)
- Considered correlations (left vote splitting, NC-UML competition)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation of all sources with quality ratings. Good distinction between mainstream (The Hindu, Xinhua) and ideological (Jacobin) sources. Noted Nepal News Evening Briefing merger timing relevance. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Similar to S1-1, identified 3 classes. Added good insight about "elections following major political disruptions" as a subclass. Chose 2022 with adjustments. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 33-day window. Historical pattern analysis reasonable. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear baseline from 2022, then applied adjustments. Final: NC 46%, UML 28%, NCP 13%, RSP 9%. Slightly different from S1-1 but within reasonable range. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All 8 options assigned
- Sums to 100%
- Reasonable uncertainty distribution

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Good systematic review of all sources. Used numbered format with quality/date/fact vs opinion tags. Perhaps slightly less nuanced than Sonnet on some sources. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes with different N values (2 vs 7 vs international). Chose "Mixed-member HoR elections 2017, 2022" as primary with broader era as stabilizing prior. Strong reasoning about avoiding overfitting. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 33 days, noted that "big structural factors usually don't change" in one month. Good insight about weighting structural base rates over late-campaign anecdotes. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from base rates (NC or UML wins "highly likely"), adjusted for no alliance, left merger, RSP momentum. Final: NC 33%, UML 31%, NCP 14%, RSP 16%. Notably higher RSP than others. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options assigned, sum to 100%
- Higher RSP (16%) than other agents - could be justified by momentum evidence but may underweight FPTP structural barriers

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient bullet-point evaluation. Good quality distinctions. Concise but thorough. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes (past Nepali elections, mixed-member systems globally, emerging democracies post-protests). Chose first as most direct. Clear reasoning. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** "Days to polling: 33. Historically in Nepal, the largest-party ranking has not flipped in the last month of campaigning." Strong insight, well-supported. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Used historical frequencies (NC 50%, UML 25%, Maoist 15%, Others 10%), then adjusted. Final: NC 40%, UML 35%, NCP 15%, RSP 7%. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options covered, sums to 100%
- Higher UML than others (35%) - reflects closer NC-UML competition view

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Similar structure to S1-4. Good fact/opinion distinction. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Notably chose broader 1991-2022 elections (N=7) rather than just 2017/2022. Good justification for larger N reducing noise. Calculated frequency: NC 4/7 (57%), UML 1.5/7, Maoist 1/7. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** "Late-campaign realignments can still matter (e.g., the left alliance announced in Oct 2017)" - good specific example. "70-80% of the eventual seat hierarchy has already been baked in." (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Methodical calibration starting from historical frequencies, adjusting for alliance absence, youth surge, etc. Final: NC 40%, UML 33%, NCP 14%, RSP 9%. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All 8 options covered
- Minor parties appropriately given <1% each
- Sums to 100%

- **Score:** 15/16

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (NC/UML) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 47/29 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 40/35 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 46/28 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 33/31 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 40/33 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1 - **EXTRACTION FAILED**

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applied Strong/Moderate/Weak framework systematically. Strong: National Assembly results, electoral system mechanics, no pre-election alliance. Moderate: Urban-rural divide for RSP, youth demographics, Jhapa-5 symbolism. Weak: party claims. Well-structured.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: NC 47% → Output: NC ~42%, UML 28% → 26%); Response truncated before final probabilities
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Analyzed halved (16 days) and doubled (64 days) scenarios with specific probability impacts
- **Calibration Checklist:** Incomplete due to truncation

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Response was substantive but truncated mid-analysis
- No final probability block extracted
- Would have been a strong analysis if complete

- **Score:** N/A (extraction failure)

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4 - **EXTRACTION FAILED**

- **Evidence Weighting:** Started well with Strong/Moderate/Weak categorization. Response cut off mid-sentence ("Regional analysis opinion (unnamed")
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: NC 40%, UML 35% → Output: INCOMPLETE)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Not reached
- **Calibration Checklist:** Not reached

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Response terminated prematurely, likely due to output token limit
- Lost valuable cross-pollinated analysis (Sonnet receiving o3's outside view)

- **Score:** N/A (extraction failure)

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured analysis. Identified National Assembly results as moderate-to-strong signal. Correctly noted indirect electorate differs from HoR. Good use of framework.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: NC 46%, UML 28% → Output: NC 40%, UML 31%, Δ = NC -6, UML +3)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "If halved: widen uncertainty by +3% for late pacts; doubled: narrow spreads by ~2%"
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed - paraphrase (party winning most HoR seats), base rate stated, consistency check, top evidence (5 items), blind spot identified (late alliance), probabilities sum correctly

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction sensible: reduced NC confidence, increased UML
- RSP at 14% reflects momentum while acknowledging FPTP barriers
- NCP reduced to 11% reflecting National Assembly failure

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise bullet format. Strong evidence: historical pattern, organizational footprint. Moderate: left consolidation, anti-establishment surge, candidate refresh. Weak: constituency anecdotes, partisan claims.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: NC 33%, UML 31% → Output: NC 32%, UML 25%, Δ = NC -1, UML -6)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief mention of 33-day window, noted structural factors unlikely to change
- **Calibration Checklist:** Abbreviated but complete - all 6 items addressed

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Significant UML reduction (-6pp) attributed to "toppled government + protest blame"
- RSP at 19% is highest of all agents - may be optimistic given FPTP barriers
- NCP at 18% higher than others - possibly overweighting merger potential

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clean numbered format. Correctly weighted NA results as strong signal against NCP.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: NC 40%, UML 33% → Output: NC 44%, UML 32%, Δ = NC +4, UML -1)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "Timeframe were halved (16 d) I would widen uncertainty by +3%"
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with blind spot (NC-UML joint list)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- NC increase (+4pp) justified by NC's "106 fresh faces" rebranding effort
- NCP reduced to 10% reflecting NA failure (strongest adjustment of all agents)
- RSP at 11% with good reasoning about FPTP conversion hurdle

- **Score:** 15/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 47/29/14/7 | FAILED | - | N/A | - |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 40/35/15/7 | FAILED | - | N/A | - |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 46/28/13/9 | 40/31/11/14 | -6/+3/-2/+5 | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 33/31/14/16 | 32/25/18/19 | -1/-6/+4/+3 | 13/16 | Partial (RSP high) |
| S2-5 | o3 | 40/33/14/9 | 44/32/10/11 | +4/-1/-4/+2 | 15/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**
  - S2-2 (Sonnet ← o3): FAILED before completion
  - S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← Sonnet): Yes, explicitly stated "Outside view distribution: [46, 28, 13, 9...]" and made reasoned adjustments
  - S2-4 (o3 ← GPT-5.2): Yes, started from the base rate [33, 31, 14, 16] and applied systematic adjustments

- **Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**
  - S2-4 made relatively large adjustments from the input, particularly reducing UML by 6pp. This could be seen as either appropriate updating or underweighting the cross-pollinated view.
  - Generally appropriate engagement observed

- **Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**
  - Cannot assess S2-1 due to failure
  - S2-5 (o3 ← o3) showed modest adjustments from its own S1 (+4 NC, -1 UML), suggesting appropriate refinement rather than radical revision

- **Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**
  - Only 3 working outputs limits assessment
  - Final spread: NC 32-44% (12pp), UML 25-32% (7pp), RSP 11-19% (8pp)
  - Reasonable diversity maintained despite reduced ensemble

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- Did all instances correctly understand the resolution criteria? **Yes** - all understood "party with most seats in 2026 HoR election"
- Did they accurately identify the forecast timeframe? **Yes** - all correctly stated 33 days to election, March 5, 2026
- Did they correctly assess current status/state of affairs? **Yes** - accurate on interim government, post-protest context, March 5 election date

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. 2022 election results: NC 89 seats, UML 78, Maoist 32, RSP 20
2. Electoral system: 165 FPTP + 110 PR = 275 total seats
3. September 2025 Gen Z protests toppled Oli government
4. Left merger formed Nepali Communist Party (November 2025)
5. January 2026 National Assembly: NC-UML alliance won 17/17, NCP won 0/18
6. No national opinion polling exists for Nepal
7. NC-UML contesting independently (no pre-election alliance for HoR)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1 | Minor | The Hindu mentioned "Election Commission of India" error | Low - correctly identified as copy-editing sloppiness |
| Research | Minor | Some confusion about exact date of Gen Z protests (sources say Sept 8-9, 2025) | Low |

### Hallucinations

None detected. All agents grounded their analyses in the provided research outputs and cross-referenced facts appropriately.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent historical grounding** - All agents correctly used 2017 and 2022 election results as base rates, with appropriate discussion of the mixed electoral system's mechanics
2. **Strong source evaluation** - Consistent fact vs. opinion distinction, appropriate skepticism toward partisan claims and ideological sources
3. **Good use of recent signal** - The January 2026 National Assembly results were correctly identified as a key organizational strength indicator, with appropriate caveats about the indirect electorate
4. **Appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment** - All agents noted the absence of opinion polling and maintained reasonable probability spreads rather than overconfident point estimates

### Weaknesses
1. **Critical extraction failures** - 2/5 agents (40%) failed to contribute probabilities, fundamentally undermining the ensemble approach
2. **Reduced model diversity** - Final aggregation only includes GPT-5.2 and o3 (no Sonnet 4.5), losing the intended cross-model diversification
3. **RSP probability spread** - Range of 11-19% for RSP reflects genuine uncertainty but also analytical disagreement about FPTP conversion potential

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| **C** | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: C**

Rationale: The working agents produced high-quality analysis with sound reasoning and appropriate calibration. However, the 40% extraction failure rate fundamentally compromises the ensemble methodology. The final prediction is based on only 3 of 5 agents, reducing robustness and model diversity. Had all agents succeeded, this would likely be a B.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add specific queries for party organizational capacity (field offices, local candidates filed, etc.)
- Include queries for regional/constituency-level sentiment indicators
- Target academic election analysis from Nepali universities

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Critical:** Investigate and fix the extraction failure for Sonnet 4.5 agents - responses appear truncated before final probability blocks
- Consider adding output length guardrails to ensure probability blocks are always included
- Add fallback extraction patterns if primary pattern fails
- Log token counts to detect truncation before it happens

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Both instances failed extraction. Check if output token limits are being hit. Consider condensing the framework requirements to leave room for final probability block.
- **GPT-5.2:** Good balanced analysis, perhaps slightly optimistic on RSP (16% S1 → 14% S2)
- **o3:** Consistent, well-structured outputs. S2-4 had the most aggressive RSP estimate (19%) which may warrant investigation
