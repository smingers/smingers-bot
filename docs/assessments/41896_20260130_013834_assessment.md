# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Major CDF discrepancy: Final submitted CDF has median ~15% but agents predicted ~11% | Critical | Aggregation | Final prediction.json shows median at 15% (50th percentile = 0.95), yet all 5 agents predicted medians of 10.5-12% |
| Confusing November vs December 2025 data | Medium | Research | Sources cite both "November 12.3%" and "December 12.3%" - agents generally handled this but some confusion exists |
| AskNews search returned no Egypt-specific results | Medium | Research | Current news search for Egypt inflation forecasts returned mostly irrelevant articles about Brazil, Russia, Kazakhstan, etc. |
| Wide CDF tails below question bounds | Low | S2-2, S2-4, S2-5 | Some agents specified 1st percentiles (6-8.5%) below question range floor, though handled by CDF generation |

**NOTE: The Critical aggregation issue appears to be a fundamental problem with the CDF interpretation or generation - the prediction.json shows a CDF where P(value < 15%) ≈ 0.95, meaning the bot predicted ~95% probability that inflation will be BELOW 15%, which actually aligns with the agents' ~11% median predictions. The percentile values in prediction.json represent CDF probabilities, not the percentile values themselves. This is correct behavior.**

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "Egypt urban inflation history" (Google)
2. "Egypt central bank inflation outlook" (Google News)
3. "Retrieve Egypt monthly Urban CPI YoY 2014-2025 and policy commentary from Trading Economics, IMF reports, and CBE statements" (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. "Egypt inflation forecast March 2026" (Google)
2. "Egypt urban CPI outlook 2026" (Google News)
3. "Please gather the latest analyst notes and IMF or central-bank commentary that project Egypt's urban inflation path through March 2026" (Assistant)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2014-2025 historical series | Forward-looking 2026 forecasts |
| Content type | Base rate data, long-term trends | Expert forecasts, policy guidance |
| Unique contribution | Establishes volatility patterns, disinflation trajectory | Recent Dec 2025 baseline (12.3%), CBE targets |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are appropriately discrete with minimal overlap
- Historical queries successfully targeted base rate establishment (obtained full 2014-2025 context)
- Current queries surfaced critical decision-relevant information: December 2025 = 12.3%, CBE target of 7%±2pp by Q4 2026
- **Gap:** Current news search returned mostly non-Egypt articles (Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan). The Egypt-specific content was sparse - only Al-Jazeera (mentioning SocGen forecast) and Al-Ain (Jan 15, 2026) provided Egypt-specific forecasts

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs appropriately remain factual and do not inappropriately include probability estimates. The historical query analysis provides base rate context (e.g., "central tendency around 13-17%") but this is descriptive analysis rather than forecast injection. Current query analysis similarly provides factual synthesis without pre-forecasting.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - December 2025 Urban CPI YoY: 12.3% (confirmed across multiple sources)
  - CBE target: 7%±2pp by Q4 2026
  - IMF FY2025-26 forecast: 11.8%
  - BNP Paribas FY2026 average: 10.7%
  - Historical trend: 33.88% (2023) → 12.3% (Dec 2025)
  - Expected 100bp rate cut at Feb 12, 2026 CBE meeting

- **Critical information missed:**
  - January 2026 inflation print (may not have been released yet)
  - Detailed month-by-month trajectory for late 2025

- **Source quality:** High - CAPMAS official data confirmed via Trading Economics, CBE official communications, professional forecasters (BNP Paribas, Capital Economics, Société Générale)

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Evaluates 6 sources systematically, rates quality (Low/Moderate/High), distinguishes fact from opinion (e.g., "Expert opinion" vs "Critical source - official forward guidance"), identifies most recent data (Dec 2025: 12.3%).
- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Considers 3 reference classes (post-2016 reform, 2022-2026 cycle, EM disinflation). Selects Egypt 2022-2026 cycle with clear justification (same monetary framework, recent data, CBE guidance).
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 2-month horizon. Examines monthly patterns (June-December 2025 trajectory). Notes 0.5-2.0pp typical monthly variation.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear reasoning from December baseline (12.3%), applies CBE guidance, estimates 10.5-12.5% central range, derives percentiles systematically.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of ~11% with 4.5pp (90/10) spread is reasonable
- Distribution appropriately right-skewed for tail risks
- Anchors on specific data points (12.3% Dec 2025)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough coverage of 7 sources, clear quality ratings, good date stamping. Correctly identifies Agent Report as critical for Dec 2025 12.3% figure.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considers 3 classes. Selects Egypt 2024-2025 trajectory - slightly narrower than S1-1 but still appropriate.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 2 months. Calculates monthly decline rate (0.32pp/month). Considers seasonal patterns.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Linear interpolation approach (12.3% → 7% target, 40% of way = 10.2%). Adjusts for non-linearity. Systematic percentile reasoning.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution (8.5-13.5% for 10th-90th) is well-calibrated
- Mode around 10-11% aligns with CBE disinflation path

- **Score:** 14/16 (slightly less rigorous justification for tail probabilities)

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (o3-mini)

- **Source Analysis:** Adequate but briefer than S1-1/S1-2. Covers key sources but less detail on fact vs opinion distinction.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies two classes (historical high-inflation episodes, late-2025 period). Combines both which is reasonable.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly notes ~2 months. Less quantitative analysis of historical patterns.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchors on 12.3% Dec 2025. Notes uncertainty but broader distribution (9-15% for 10th-90th).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Wider uncertainty range (6pp vs 4-5pp for others) may be overcautious
- Median ~12% is slightly higher than other agents

- **Score:** 12/16 (adequate but less rigorous than Sonnet outputs)

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent systematic evaluation. Quality ratings, publication dates, clear fact/opinion separation. Notes TE December 2025 = 12.3% as "highest-quality factual source."
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considers 3 classes. Selects Egypt monthly Urban-CPI 2014-2025 (132 observations) with specific historical statistics (median 3-month change = 1.6pp).
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly calculates ~2.5 month horizon. Notes ±3pp historical 80% interval. Quantitative approach.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Base case -1.5 to -2.5pp from Dec-25, giving center ~10-11%. Triangle distribution with fattened tails.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Widest distribution (7.5-15% for 10th-90th) reflects EM shock frequency consideration
- Good tail calibration based on historical volatility

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good coverage, clear quality distinctions. Identifies Agent Report's Dec 2025 12.3% as key.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Two classes (10-year distribution and 2024-2025 window). Prioritizes recent window but retains 10-year for tail risk.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly notes 60-day horizon. Quantifies ±1-3pp typical 2-month moves, notes shock scenarios (10pp swings).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Baseline 12.3%, expects ~11% central estimate. Triangle weighting around 11% center.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution 8-16% for 10th-90th with right skew is appropriate
- Mean 11.5% aligns with policy trajectory

- **Score:** 14/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Median) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~11.4% | 15/16 | Systematic source evaluation, clear reference class justification | None significant |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~11.0% | 14/16 | Good linear interpolation approach | Slightly less rigorous tail justification |
| S1-3 | o3-mini | ~12.0% | 12/16 | Captures key data points | Briefer analysis than Sonnet/o3 outputs |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~10.8% | 15/16 | Quantitative reference class statistics (132 observations) | None significant |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~11.0% | 14/16 | Good shock probability analysis with historical justification | None significant |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Median |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | ~11.4% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~10.8% |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~11.0% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (o3-mini) | ~12.0% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | ~11.0% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent use of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly identifies Dec 2025 12.3% and CBE targets as strong evidence, planned easing as moderate, fuel stability as moderate.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~11.4% → Output: 11.1%, Δ = -0.3pp. Justified by stronger recent evidence (Dec 2025 confirmation, explicit expert forecasts).
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses halved/doubled scenarios explicitly (halved: 11.8-12.8%; doubled: 9.5-11.5%).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete - paraphrases target, states base rate, consistency check, top evidence, blind-spot (geopolitical), status quo assessment.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Both central estimate and uncertainty appropriately updated
- Tails widened (8.5-16.5% vs 9.5-14%) to account for geopolitical risks
- CDF is monotonic based on percentile outputs

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong use of framework. Detailed categorization with causal mechanisms (e.g., "established disinflation trend... Causal mechanism: CBE rate hikes, exchange rate stabilization").
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~10.8% → Output: 10.8%, Δ = 0pp. Justified by moderately narrowing distribution rather than shifting center.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed (shorter = tighter distribution, longer = wider).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with good blind-spot identification (EGP devaluation to 55+).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution narrowed from S1-4's 7.5-15% to 8.5-13.5% (appropriate given inside view evidence)
- Mode shifted from 10.8% to 10.5% - small but justified adjustment

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (o3-mini): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Adequate but less detailed than Sonnet outputs. Uses Strong/Moderate/Weak terminology appropriately.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~11.0% → Output: 10.5%, Δ = -0.5pp. Justified by official guidance and momentum.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief treatment ("if twice as fast... if slower").
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present but less detailed.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Narrower tails (8.0-14.5% for 1st-99th) - may be underestimating tail risk
- Median 10.5% is reasonable given evidence

- **Score:** 13/16 (adequate but less thorough)

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent systematic approach. Identifies 5-month trend (11-13%), notes historical pattern that once CPI breaks below 15%, subsequent 3-month change rarely exceeds ±1pp.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~12.0% → Output: 11.6%, Δ = -0.4pp. Justified by downward momentum, base effects, fuel-price freeze.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good - discusses halved/doubled horizons with specific tightening/widening estimates.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and detailed.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Right-skewed distribution appropriate (upside shocks historically more frequent)
- Implied mean 12.2%, median 11.6% - slight positive skew appropriate

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good systematic approach. Weights hard data (Dec 2025 12.3%), trend (–1pp per quarter), policy context, and forecasts.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~11.0% → Output: 11.0%, Δ = 0pp. Median unchanged but distribution refined.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but adequate (one month vs four months discussion).
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with good consistency check.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Distribution 8.5-14.5% (10th-90th) with right skew is appropriate
- Mean 11.3% vs median 11.0% reflects appropriate positive skew

- **Score:** 14/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input Median | Final Median | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|-----------------|--------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 11.4% | 11.1% | -0.3pp | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 10.8% | 10.8% | 0pp | 15/16 | Yes (narrowed distribution) |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | 11.0% | 10.5% | -0.5pp | 13/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 12.0% | 11.6% | -0.4pp | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 11.0% | 11.0% | 0pp | 14/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**
  - S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's S1-4): Yes - explicitly narrowed the distribution based on inside view evidence while maintaining the center
  - S2-3 (o3-mini receiving Sonnet's S1-2): Yes - adjusted median down from 11% to 10.5% based on CBE guidance
  - S2-4 (o3 receiving o3-mini's S1-3): Yes - corrected the higher S1-3 median (12%) down to 11.6%

- **Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**
  - S2-4 appropriately reduced the higher S1-3 estimate, showing good critical evaluation
  - No instances of over-weighting detected

- **Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**
  - S2-1 and S2-5 made smaller adjustments (0-0.3pp) compared to S2-4's -0.4pp
  - This suggests cross-pollination provides useful correction when the input model produces outlier estimates

- **Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**
  - **Decreased diversity (convergence):** Final medians ranged 10.5-11.6% (1.1pp spread) vs S1 medians 10.8-12.0% (1.2pp spread)
  - This convergence is appropriate given the strong factual consensus on Dec 2025 baseline

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria:** Yes - all referenced Trading Economics as resolution source, understood YoY % change for March 2026
- **Accurately identified forecast timeframe:** Yes - all correctly noted ~2 month horizon (some rounded to "60 days", "2-3 months")
- **Correctly assessed current status:** Yes - all anchored on December 2025 = 12.3%

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. December 2025 Urban CPI YoY = 12.3% (CAPMAS/Trading Economics)
2. CBE target: 7% ±2pp by Q4 2026
3. IMF FY2025-26 forecast: 11.8%
4. Disinflation trend from 33-38% (2023) to current levels
5. Expected 100bp rate cut at Feb 12, 2026 meeting

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Data discrepancy | Cites "Sep-25 13.5%, Oct-25 13.8%, Nov-25 13.1%" but other sources cite Oct=12.5%, Nov=12.3% | Low - final baseline still correct |
| S1-1 | Minor date error | Initially states "March 2026 is approximately 14 months from today" then corrects to 2 months | Low - self-corrected |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All cited data points (Dec 2025 12.3%, CBE targets, IMF forecasts) are corroborated across multiple research sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Excellent research quality:** Successfully identified December 2025 baseline (12.3%) from multiple credible sources (CAPMAS, Trading Economics, multiple news outlets)
2. **Strong consensus on central estimate:** All 5 agents converged on 10.5-11.6% median range, demonstrating robustness
3. **Appropriate uncertainty quantification:** 10th-90th percentile ranges of 4-6pp are calibrated to historical Egypt CPI volatility
4. **Good cross-pollination effectiveness:** S2-4 appropriately corrected S1-3's higher estimate
5. **Thorough calibration checklists:** Most agents completed all checklist items with genuine engagement

### Weaknesses

1. **Current news search quality:** AskNews returned mostly irrelevant results (Brazil, Russia, etc.) - only 2-3 Egypt-specific articles
2. **Minor data inconsistencies:** Some confusion between sources on Oct/Nov 2025 exact figures
3. **S1-3 (o3-mini) less thorough:** Briefer analysis than Sonnet and o3 models

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| **B** | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: [A-]**

Rationale: Strong research successfully surfaced the critical December 2025 baseline. All agents demonstrated sound reasoning with appropriate base rate anchoring. Minor deduction for: (1) suboptimal current news search results, (2) slight data inconsistencies that didn't ultimately affect the forecast, (3) o3-mini's briefer analysis.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Improve AskNews query specificity:** Current query "Egypt's urban inflation path through March 2026" returned mostly non-Egypt results. Consider more specific queries like "Egypt CPI January 2026" or "CAPMAS inflation Egypt 2026"
2. **Add fallback search strategies:** When primary news search returns poor results, trigger additional searches with different query formulations

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Consider extracting specific month baseline more explicitly:** The December 2025 = 12.3% figure was critical but required inference from research context
2. **Add explicit data reconciliation step:** When sources conflict (e.g., Oct 2025 being cited as both 12.5% and 13.8%), prompt agents to reconcile before proceeding

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **o3-mini:** Could benefit from more structured source evaluation prompts to match Sonnet/o3 depth
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Consistently strong performance; consider using for query generation as well as forecasting
- **o3:** Good quantitative analysis; slight tendency toward wider distributions

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (numeric) | No | Spread = 1.1pp on medians; range = 30%, so 1.1/30 = 3.7% |
| Update direction errors | No | All Step 2 updates were in justified directions |
| Factual errors present | Minor | S1-4 data discrepancy on Oct-Nov figures |
| Hallucinations detected | No | All facts corroborated |
| Cross-pollination effective | Yes | S2-4 appropriately corrected S1-3's higher estimate |
| Critical info missed in research | Minor | Jan 2026 print not found (may not be released yet) |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All properly anchored on Dec 2025 = 12.3% |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | No | All medians within 10.5-11.6% |
