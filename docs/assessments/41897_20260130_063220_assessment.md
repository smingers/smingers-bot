# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Mismatched base rate in S1-2/S2-3 | High | S1-2, S2-3 | Used lower "recent trend" rate (0.13/mo) despite current conditions having WORSE structural vulnerability (single line) than historical average |
| Wide ensemble spread (38pp) | Medium | Aggregation | Final probabilities ranged from 30% to 68%; partly explained by the S1-2/S2-3 base rate mismatch |
| Critical current status discovered late | Medium | S2-All | The January 19, 2026 power restoration was only surfaced in current search, fundamentally changing the forecasting context |
| Conflicting power line status interpretation | Medium | S1/S2-All | Some agents counted 1 operational line, others 2; resolution criteria requires loss of "all" lines |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant blackout history (Google)
2. IAEA update Zaporizhzhia power loss 2026 (Google News)
3. Provide a chronological list (2022-Jan 30 2026) of every instance when Zaporizhzhia NPP lost all external power... (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Zaporizhzhia plant blackout January 2026 (Google)
2. IAEA warns Zaporizhzhia power lines risk (Google News)
3. Provide recent IAEA reports and expert analysis on Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant external power risks before May 2026 (Assistant)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2022-2025 base rate establishment | January 2026 status and recent events |
| Content type | Chronological event database | Policy/diplomatic updates, repair status |
| Unique contribution | 10 blackouts counted, inter-arrival times | January 19 power restoration, ceasefire news |

**Analysis:**
- The queries are appropriately discrete. Historical queries successfully targeted base rate establishment through chronological reconstruction of blackout events.
- Current queries surfaced the critical January 19, 2026 power restoration and the ongoing ceasefire/repair context.
- The agent query for historical data was well-crafted but returned incomplete data (only 6 of 10 blackouts documented in detail).
- **Critical information successfully surfaced:** The January 19, 2026 restoration of the "Ferrosplavna-1" line was discovered through current search, fundamentally affecting the forecasting context.
- **Gap:** Historical queries did not fully document blackouts #7-9 (between March 2023 and September 2025).

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remain appropriately factual. No probability estimates appear in the search summaries. The agent report provides chronological data without forecasting conclusions. Sources quote experts (Grossi, Zelenskyy) making qualitative risk assessments ("not sustainable," "critical") but not numerical probabilities.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - 10 total blackouts from August 2022 to September 2025
  - Power restored January 19, 2026 via Ferrosplavna-1 (330 kV) line
  - Plant currently operating on single line (750 kV still severed per some sources, or 330 kV restored per others)
  - IAEA emergency board meeting on January 30, 2026
  - Fourth IAEA-negotiated ceasefire on January 17, 2026
  - Year-long repair campaign initiated

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Exact current status of both 750 kV and 330 kV lines (conflicting reports)
  - Detailed timeline of blackouts #7-9 (2023-2024)

- **Source quality:** High - IAEA, AFP, AP, technical publications (ANS, NucNet) provided authoritative data

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematically evaluated all 7 sources with quality ratings (High/Medium/Low) and distinguished factual content from expert opinion. Correctly identified the BBC as dated but reliable, AP/TIME as high-quality contemporaneous reporting.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Identified 3 possible classes (ZNPP-specific, nuclear plants in war zones, critical infrastructure attacks) and correctly selected ZNPP-specific history as most suitable due to specificity and direct relevance.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly identified 91-day window. Calculated historical intervals between documented blackouts (3-106 days). Noted average interval of ~127 days but acknowledged significant variance.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Sound methodology with appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment. Calculated 0.79% daily probability from 10 blackouts over 1,260 days, yielding 52% for 91 days via complement. However, introduced complexity with conditional scenarios that may have muddied the estimate.

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- Derived 48% probability with clear pathway
- Considered both Yes (historical pattern continues) and No (repairs succeed, power maintained) pathways
- The final weighting of scenarios (40%/40%/20%) was somewhat arbitrary

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Careful evaluation distinguishing factual reporting from opinion across all sources. Noted the Agent Report's incomplete reconstruction and appropriately flagged gaps.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Explicitly compared three classes and selected ZNPP-specific history. Noted the declining trend between early and late phases (0.86/mo vs 0.13/mo).

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly used Poisson model. Calculated 0.13 blackouts/month for recent period yielding 32% via 1-e^(-0.39).

- **Base Rate Derivation:** **Problematic.** The agent used the lower "recent trend" rate (0.13/mo from post-March 2023) on the rationale that conditions have improved. However, this reasoning is flawed: the plant currently operates on a SINGLE power line, which is *worse* structural vulnerability than during most of the historical period when 2 lines were typically available. Using a lower rate to reflect "improvement" when the actual vulnerability has increased represents a mismatched base rate. The declining frequency in 2023-2025 likely reflected having two lines as backup; that cushion no longer exists.

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- Derived 30% probability
- The "declining trend" interpretation fails to account for current single-line vulnerability
- This base rate is poorly matched to current conditions

- **Score:** 10/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (o3-mini)

- **Source Analysis:** Good overview but less systematic than Sonnet outputs. Correctly identified key factual consensus (10 blackouts, 2 remaining lines).

- **Reference Class Selection:** Appropriate choice of ZNPP-specific class. Less explicit comparison of alternatives.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 92-day window. Calculated frequency at 0.40 blackouts/month from 10 events over 25 months.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Used simple Poisson model but with different time period (25 months rather than 29 or 42). Yielded 47% baseline but adjusted upward to account for fragility. Final estimate of 47% is well-calibrated to the evidence.

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- Arrived at 47% with reasonable calibration
- Acknowledged repair efforts and international attention as moderating factors

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but effective. Correctly categorized sources by reliability. Noted 10 blackouts as factual consensus.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Explicitly justified ZNPP-specific class as avoiding "stretching a flimsy global database."

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent. Used two models: (1) historical λ=0.40/mo → 70% for 3 months, (2) recent trend λ=0.23/mo → 50%. Blended 60/40 to get 58%.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Sophisticated dual-model approach with explicit weighting. Acknowledged uncertainty with ±10pp bands.

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- Derived 58% with well-justified blend
- Explicitly considered both historical and recent-trend models
- The 60/40 weighting is somewhat arbitrary but reasonable

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Systematic and thorough. Each source rated and factual content clearly distinguished from opinion.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Three classes considered, ZNPP-specific correctly selected.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent quantitative work. Calculated λ=0.34/mo from 10 events in 29 months. 90% Bayesian credible interval computed (0.22-0.48/mo).

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Most sophisticated analysis. Computed Poisson P=64% from base rate, then adjusted by blending toward recent 12-month trend (24%). Final 57% with explicit uncertainty quantification.

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- Derived 57% with excellent uncertainty acknowledgment
- Considered both Yes (pattern continues) and No (trend decline) pathways

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 48% | 13/16 | Thorough source analysis | Complex conditional scenarios |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 30% | 10/16 | Identified declining trend | **Mismatched base rate** - used lower "recent" rate despite worse current vulnerability |
| S1-3 | o3-mini | 47% | 11/16 | Balanced calibration | Less systematic analysis |
| S1-4 | o3 | 58% | 14/16 | Dual-model blending | Arbitrary 60/40 weighting |
| S1-5 | o3 | 57% | 15/16 | Bayesian uncertainty | Slightly mechanical |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 48% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 58% |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 30% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (o3-mini) | 47% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 57% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong/Moderate/Weak framework properly applied. Correctly identified January 19 restoration as strong evidence, IAEA degradation warning as strong evidence in opposite direction, and resumed military activity as strong evidence.

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 48% → Output: 68%, Δ = +20pp)
  The large upward update is driven by the finding that only one line is currently operational (single-point failure vulnerability). The reasoning that losing one line = total blackout is sound, but +20pp may be excessive.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly discussed halving (30%) and doubling (78%) scenarios. Good analysis showing probability scales appropriately with time.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and meaningful. Paraphrase correct, base rate stated, consistency check performed ("68 out of 100 times"), top evidence identified, blind spot acknowledged (IAEA protection zone), status quo considered.

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- Update direction (upward from 48% to 68%) is debatable given the recent restoration
- The emphasis on single-line vulnerability is valid but conflicts with downward adjustment for "recent restoration"
- Final probability is internally consistent with stated reasoning

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Explicitly categorized evidence into Strong/Moderate/Weak. Correctly weighted January 19 restoration and grid degradation as strong opposing factors.

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 58% → Output: 48%, Δ = -10pp)
  Downward update justified by recent restoration and current power status. The reasoning that the 4-month blackout period was a single ongoing crisis (now resolved) is sophisticated.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good discussion of halving (35-40%) and doubling (70-75%) scenarios.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All six elements addressed meaningfully.

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- Update direction (downward) appropriately reflects the January 19 restoration
- Magnitude (-10pp) is well-justified by the specific new information
- Reasoning is internally consistent

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (o3-mini): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear Strong/Moderate/Weak categorization. Correctly weighted historical base rate and repair efforts.

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 30% → Output: 30%, Δ = 0pp)
  No update from the received outside view. The agent inherited S1-2's flawed base rate without correction.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but present. Notes Poisson-like process scaling.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete but relatively brief.

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- **Failed to correct the inherited base rate problem.** The current research clearly showed the plant is operating on a single line (Ferrosplavna-1 restored Jan 19, but 750 kV still severed). This single-point-of-failure vulnerability should have prompted an upward adjustment from the 30% base rate, not confirmation of it.
- The agent noted "repair efforts" as a moderating factor but missed that repairs only restored ONE line, leaving the plant MORE vulnerable than the historical average when two lines were typically available.
- This represents a failure to integrate current evidence with the received base rate.

- **Score:** 9/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent categorization with explicit Strong/Moderate/Weak labels. Systematic treatment of each evidence piece.

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 47% → Output: 52%, Δ = +5pp)
  Small upward update driven by single-line vulnerability and continued combat. Net adjustment (+3pts from base Poisson) is modest and well-justified.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicit Poisson calculations for halved (32%) and doubled (80%) windows.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Thorough. All elements present including blind spot ("rapid restoration combined with sustained ceasefire could slash risk").

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- Update direction (slight upward) balances repair progress against structural vulnerability
- Magnitude (+5pp) is appropriately modest
- Excellent internal consistency

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-organized Strong/Moderate/Weak framework with explicit bullets.

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 57% → Output: 65%, Δ = +8pp)
  Upward update driven by: (1) single operational line (+6pts), (2) fighting near plant (+4pts), offset by repair progress (-5pts) and trend decline (-2pts). Arithmetic is transparent.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Present with Poisson-based scaling.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and explicit. Blind spot identified (rapid repair of both lines).

**Question-type-specific assessment (Binary):**
- Update direction (upward) emphasizes structural vulnerability
- Magnitude (+8pp) is reasonable given single-line status
- Strong internal consistency

- **Score:** 14/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 48% | 68% | +20pp | 13/16 | Partial - magnitude high |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 58% | 48% | -10pp | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | o3-mini | 30% | 30% | 0pp | 9/16 | **No** - inherited flawed base rate, failed to correct for single-line vulnerability |
| S2-4 | o3 | 47% | 52% | +5pp | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 57% | 65% | +8pp | 14/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 ← S1-4 o3):** Yes. Explicitly engaged with the 58% base rate from o3 and made a justified -10pp adjustment. The cross-pollination worked well here, bringing a moderating perspective.

- **S2-3 (o3-mini ← S1-2 Sonnet 4.5):** Partially. Received the low 30% base rate and did not update. Should have considered that S1-2's analysis predated the January 19 restoration news that was surfaced in current research. The lack of update suggests limited engagement with new information.

- **S2-4 (o3 ← S1-3 o3-mini):** Yes. Made a thoughtful +5pp adjustment from the 47% input, showing genuine engagement with both the received base rate and new evidence.

**Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**

- S2-3 may have over-weighted the low S1-2 input by not adjusting upward despite new evidence about single-line vulnerability.

**Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**

- S2-1 (Sonnet receiving Sonnet) made the largest adjustment (+20pp), suggesting potential overconfidence in updating.
- S2-5 (o3 receiving o3) made a reasonable +8pp adjustment.
- Cross-model instances showed more conservative updates overall (ranging from -10pp to +5pp).

**Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**

- Increased diversity. Final spread (30%-68%) was wider than S1 spread (30%-58%). This suggests the cross-pollination may have amplified rather than dampened disagreement, possibly because agents interpreted the current research differently.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **Resolution criteria:** All instances correctly understood that the question requires simultaneous loss of ALL external power lines (full blackout), not just partial outages.

- **Forecast timeframe:** All instances correctly identified the 91-day window from January 30, 2026 to May 1, 2026.

- **Current status:** Correctly identified that power was restored on January 19, 2026, meaning the question asks about a NEW blackout event.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. 10 complete blackouts occurred between August 2022 and September 2025
2. Power was restored via the Ferrosplavna-1 (330 kV) line on January 19, 2026
3. The September 23, 2025 blackout was the longest during the conflict
4. IAEA Director General Grossi repeatedly characterized the situation as "not sustainable"
5. Plant requires continuous cooling despite reactors being in cold shutdown

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1, S2-1 | Line status ambiguity | Some confusion about whether both lines or just one is operational | Medium |
| S1-2 | Period calculation | Used 42 months vs others using 25-29 months | Low |
| S1-3 | Inconsistent dates | Referenced some sources with apparent typos (e.g., "Jun 10, 2025" reporting Sept 2025 event) | Low |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All factual claims can be traced to the provided source materials. Dates, event counts, and technical details match across sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research phase:** Both historical and current queries surfaced decision-relevant information. The discovery of the January 19, 2026 restoration was critical.

2. **Sound base rate methodology:** Multiple agents used Poisson modeling appropriately, with several providing Bayesian credible intervals and dual-model approaches.

3. **Good calibration checklist compliance:** All Step 2 outputs completed meaningful calibration checks, including blind spot identification.

4. **Appropriate source evaluation:** Agents consistently distinguished between factual reporting and expert opinion, and appropriately weighted IAEA sources highly.

### Weaknesses
1. **Mismatched base rate in S1-2/S2-3:** The most significant issue is that S1-2 selected a "recent trend" base rate (0.13/mo) on the assumption that conditions had improved. However, the plant currently has *worse* structural vulnerability (single operational line) than during most of the historical period when two lines provided redundancy. Using a lower rate when vulnerability has increased is a fundamental mismatch. S2-3 inherited this flawed rate and failed to correct it despite current research showing the single-line status.

2. **Wide ensemble spread partly explained by above:** The 38pp spread (30%-68%) is partially driven by the S1-2/S2-3 outlier. Excluding that agent, the remaining four predictions (48%, 52%, 65%, 68%) have a more reasonable 20pp spread.

3. **Conflicting power line status interpretation:** Different agents interpreted whether 1 or 2 lines were operational, leading to divergent vulnerability assessments. The research could have been clearer on this point.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B-**

The forecast demonstrates strong research and generally sound methodology. Four of five agents produced well-reasoned predictions in a defensible 48%-68% range. However, the S1-2/S2-3 pathway contains a base rate mismatch: using a lower "recent trend" rate on the assumption conditions had improved, when current single-line vulnerability is actually *worse* than the historical average. This error dragged down the ensemble average and inflated the spread. Excluding the outlier, the remaining predictions average 58.3% with a 20pp spread - a more coherent result.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Add dedicated query for current power line status:** A specific query like "ZNPP power line status January 2026 which lines operational" would clarify the ambiguity about 750 kV vs 330 kV line availability.

2. **Request explicit blackout timeline 2023-2025:** The historical research only documented 6 of 10 blackouts in detail. A more targeted query could fill the gap for events #7-9.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Prompt agents to verify base rate applicability:** The Step 1 prompt could explicitly ask: "Does your chosen base rate period reflect conditions similar to the current forecasting environment? If current vulnerability is higher or lower than the historical average, adjust accordingly."

2. **Emphasize current status verification in Step 2:** The Step 2 prompt could explicitly ask agents to reconcile any discrepancies between the received Step 1 base rate assumptions and current search findings, rather than simply accepting the inherited rate.

3. **Add spread monitoring:** Consider flagging forecasts with >25pp ensemble spread for additional review or agent iteration.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **S1-2/S2-3 (Sonnet 4.5 / o3-mini):** The S1-2 → S2-3 pathway produced a mismatched base rate that propagated through cross-pollination. The issue originated in S1-2's selection of a "recent trend" rate without accounting for the fact that current single-line status represents worse vulnerability than the period that rate was drawn from. S2-3 then failed to correct this in Step 2. Consider adding explicit prompts about matching base rate conditions to current conditions.

- **Sonnet 4.5 (Agent 1):** Large update magnitude (+20pp) suggests potential overconfidence. Consider prompting for more conservative adjustments.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp (binary) | **Yes** | 38pp spread (30% to 68%) |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates directionally consistent with evidence |
| Factual errors present | No | Minor ambiguities but no clear errors |
| Hallucinations detected | No | All claims traceable to sources |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Mixed results; S2-3 inherited flawed base rate without correction |
| Critical info missed in research | No | Key January 19 restoration surfaced |
| Base rate mismatch | **Yes** | S1-2 used "recent trend" rate despite current conditions having worse vulnerability than that period |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | **Yes** | S2-3 at 30% is ~1.8 SD below mean of 52.6%; explained by inherited base rate mismatch |
