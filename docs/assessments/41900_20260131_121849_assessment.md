# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Base rate divergence across agents | Medium | S1-3, S1-4 | Agents 3 and 4 derived much higher outside-view base rates (11%, 22%) using different methodology (exponential waiting-time) compared to other agents (2-4%) using historical precedent directly |
| Insufficient cross-pollination adjustment | Low | S2-4 | Agent 4 received Agent 3's high 11% outside view but only adjusted to 9%, potentially over-anchoring on the received base rate |
| Research did not surface October 2025 denial in historical search | Low | Research | The critical October 18, 2025 OpenAI denial was only fully utilized in current search results, not historical |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. OpenAI GPT-6 timeline 2025 interview (Google)
2. Sam Altman on GPT-6 release (Google News)
3. Provide a timeline of OpenAI model releases from GPT-3 onward with announcement and general availability dates; then list and cite every public statement since 2024 in which OpenAI leadership discussed GPT-6 development or release expectations. Include source URLs. (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. OpenAI GPT-6 public release (Google)
2. GPT-6 general availability OpenAI (Google News)
3. Search recent OpenAI documentation or Newsroom posts from January 2026 confirming whether GPT-6 is listed as a generally available model. (Assistant)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2024-2025 leadership statements and release timeline | January 2026 documentation and announcements |
| Content type | Interviews, release history, leadership quotes | Official docs, API listings, news about model changes |
| Unique contribution | GPT-4→GPT-5 gap (29 months), Altman's "faster" commitment, October 2025 denial | Confirmed GPT-6 absence from docs, GPT-4o retirement, GPT-5.2 focus |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets were reasonably discrete, with historical queries targeting base rate establishment and current queries targeting present-day evidence.
- Historical queries successfully surfaced the critical October 18, 2025 official denial that GPT-6 would not ship in 2025.
- Current queries effectively confirmed the complete absence of GPT-6 from January 2026 communications and surfaced the important context of OpenAI retiring older models while focusing on GPT-5.2.
- **Critical information surfaced well:** The research pipeline found the two most important pieces of evidence - the October denial and the January 30-31 model deprecation announcement with zero GPT-6 mention.
- **Gap:** No queries specifically targeted developer community discussions, GitHub issues, or API changelog monitoring that might have revealed beta testing signals.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remained appropriately factual. Summaries reported what sources said without introducing probability estimates. The AskNews deep research analysis noted "no evidence that GPT-6 has been announced or made generally available" but did not forecast.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - October 18, 2025 OpenAI official denial of 2025 release
  - January 30-31, 2026 model deprecation announcements with no GPT-6 mention
  - Altman's August 2025 "faster than GPT-4→GPT-5 gap" statement
  - GPT-5 release date (August 7, 2025) and subsequent iterations (5.1, 5.2)
  - Historical release cadence (GPT-4 March 2023 → GPT-5 August 2025 = 29 months)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - No direct access to OpenAI API documentation to confirm absence
  - No developer forum or Discord monitoring
  - Limited coverage of internal OpenAI developments (the "Shallotpeat" project mentioned briefly)

- **Source quality:** High overall. CNBC primary source for Altman quotes, multiple corroborating sources for October denial, strong January 2026 news coverage.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematically evaluated each source (LifeArchitect.ai, CNBC, ZDNET, Times of India, Agent Report) with quality ratings and distinguished factual content from speculation. Correctly identified the Times of India "GPT-6-7" naming as likely humor.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Identified three potential classes (GPT flagship releases, CEO prediction reliability, major AI lab cadence), selected GPT flagship releases with CEO adjustment. Well-justified choice.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent. Correctly identified 90-day window, analyzed historical gaps (GPT-4→GPT-5: 29 months), calculated what "faster" would mean at various percentages.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Very thorough. Used weighted scenario analysis (80% standard timeline, 15% accelerated, 4% breakthrough, 1% black swan) yielding 0.9%, rounded to 2%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 2% probability with clear mathematical justification
- Considered both Yes and No pathways extensively
- Strong analysis of what would need to happen for Yes (surprise announcement, compressed safety testing)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Very good. Systematic evaluation of sources with quality ratings. Correctly flagged LifeArchitect.ai specification table as speculative.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified three reference classes, selected GPT-4→GPT-5 interval. Less detailed justification than Output 1 but reasonable.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 90-day window, accurate historical pattern analysis, noted that even 50% reduction from 29 months (14.5 months) would land in October 2026.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear reasoning but less mathematically rigorous than Output 1. Derived 3% through calibration anchors approach.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 3% probability
- Good consideration of both directions
- Slightly less rigorous mathematical derivation

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Adequate but less detailed. Correctly identified source quality issues but shorter evaluations.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified three classes (numbered GPT releases, frontier models broadly, all major labs), appropriately selected numbered GPT releases due to naming sensitivity.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 90-day window. Noted the demanding conjunction required for Yes.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Less rigorous than Outputs 1-2. Landed at 11% "neighborhood" with somewhat vague justification ("low teens or single digits" then settling on 11%).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 11% probability - significantly higher than other agents
- Less mathematical rigor in arriving at the probability
- Did not fully account for the October 2025 denial's implications

- **Score:** 10/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good but brief. Correctly assessed sources but less detailed than Sonnet outputs.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Identified three classes, correctly selected numbered GPT releases with clear justification for why it's most appropriate given the naming requirement.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 90-day window. Included useful mathematical analysis using exponential waiting-time distribution.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Most mathematically sophisticated but potentially flawed. Used exponential distribution with 31-month mean to derive 25% upper bound, then adjusted to 22%. The exponential distribution assumption may not be appropriate for this type of release pattern.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 22% probability - the highest among all agents
- Mathematical approach is interesting but the exponential assumption is questionable
- The adjustments (+5pp acceleration, +3pp compute, -6pp naming, -5pp regulatory) seem reasonable but starting point may be too high

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Concise but accurate source evaluations with appropriate quality ratings.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Clearly identified numbered GPT releases as the appropriate class with good justification.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent. Correctly identified 90-day window and calculated that 8-month gap would be 3.6σ faster than historical mean.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Mathematically sound. Used log-normal distribution fitted to historical data, derived ~3% base rate for <8 month gap, adjusted to 4% with explicit reasoning.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 4% probability
- Good mathematical reasoning with appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment
- Well-calibrated adjustments for competitive pressure and naming risk

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1 (2%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent. Systematically categorized evidence as Strong (official denial, absence from Jan 2026 communications, training timeline), Moderate (historical cycles, GPT-5 issues), and Weak for (Altman's "faster" statement, competitive pressure).
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 2% → Output: 2%, Δ = 0%. Maintained the base rate with strong justification that January 2026 information confirms rather than contradicts.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addressed: halved to ~1%, doubled to ~15-20%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and thorough. All six items addressed meaningfully.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (no change) matches evidence direction (confirming negative)
- Final probability internally consistent with reasoning

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4 (22%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong. Correctly applied framework, identified key negatives (official denial, absence from docs, historical pattern) and weak positives.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 22% → Output: 4%, Δ = -18pp. Large downward adjustment appropriately reflects the strong negative evidence.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Well addressed: halved to 1-2%, doubled to 15-20%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with good detail on all items.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Significant downward update from received high base rate
- Correctly identified that the high base rate needed substantial adjustment
- Strong engagement with cross-pollinated input

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2 (3%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Systematically identified strong, moderate, and weak evidence with appropriate weights.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 3% → Output: 2%, Δ = -1pp. Small downward adjustment reflecting inside-view evidence push toward No.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Well addressed: halved drops to 1-2%, doubled rises to 8-15%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with clear six-point verification.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Conservative adjustment from already-low base rate
- Good naming risk consideration

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 (11%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structure but less systematic than Sonnet outputs.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 11% → Output: 9%, Δ = -2pp. Relatively small adjustment given the strong negative evidence - may have over-anchored on received base rate.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed: halved to ~5%, doubled to ~25%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete but somewhat brief.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update magnitude may be too small given evidence strength
- Ended as the highest prediction (9%) - outlier status raises calibration questions

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5 (4%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Very thorough. Clear categorization of strong negatives (absence from docs, GPT-5.2 focus) and weak positives.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 4% → Output: 3%, Δ = -1pp. Small downward adjustment with explicit calculation.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed: halved to 1-2%, doubled to 8-10%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with explicit six-point verification.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Appropriate small adjustment from reasonable base rate
- Good blind-spot identification (surprise DevDay announcement)

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 2% | 2% | 0% | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 22% | 4% | -18pp | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 3% | 2% | -1pp | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 11% | 9% | -2pp | 12/16 | Partial |
| S2-5 | o3 | 4% | 3% | -1pp | 15/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 ← S1-4 o3):** Excellent engagement. Received the highest outside view (22%) and made appropriate large downward adjustment to 4% based on strong negative evidence. This is the cross-pollination working as intended - the model didn't anchor on the high input but appropriately calibrated.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← S1-2 Sonnet 4.5):** Good engagement. Received 3% and made small adjustment to 2%, consistent with confirming evidence.

- **S2-4 (o3 ← S1-3 GPT-5.2):** Partial engagement. Received 11% but only adjusted to 9%. Given the strong negative evidence (October denial, zero announcements), a larger downward adjustment may have been warranted. This instance may have over-anchored on the received base rate.

**Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**

- S2-4 potentially over-weighted the received input, resulting in it being an outlier (9% vs. 2-4% for others).

**Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**

- S2-1 and S2-5 both made minimal adjustments (0% and -1pp respectively) from their self-model inputs. This is appropriate given that their outside views were already well-calibrated.

**Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**

- Cross-pollination **decreased** diversity in a beneficial way. S2-2 receiving the high 22% outside view and adjusting down to 4% brought convergence toward the consensus. Without cross-pollination, the spread could have been larger (2-22% vs actual 2-9%).

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **Did all instances correctly understand the resolution criteria?** Yes. All agents correctly identified that the question requires: (1) explicit "GPT-6" naming, (2) general public availability via API or ChatGPT, (3) self-serve access without waitlist, (4) before May 1, 2026.

- **Did they accurately identify the forecast timeframe?** Yes. All agents correctly identified 90 days remaining.

- **Did they correctly assess the current status/state of affairs?** Yes. All agents recognized that GPT-6 has not been announced and is not in documentation.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. GPT-5 released August 7, 2025
2. GPT-4 to GPT-5 gap was approximately 29 months
3. October 18, 2025: OpenAI officially confirmed GPT-6 will not ship in 2025
4. January 30-31, 2026: OpenAI announced model deprecations with no GPT-6 mention
5. Altman (August 2025): GPT-6 will arrive "faster than the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5"

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Interpretation | Treated "faster than 29 months" as supporting a high base rate, but same evidence used by others to suggest much longer timeline | Medium |
| S1-3 | Ambiguity | Less precise about October 2025 denial source verification | Low |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All claims were traceable to research sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research quality:** The pipeline surfaced the two most critical pieces of evidence (October 2025 denial and January 2026 model deprecation announcement).
2. **Strong source analysis:** Most agents carefully distinguished between factual content and speculation, with appropriate quality ratings.
3. **Convergent reasoning:** Despite different base rate methodologies, 4/5 agents converged on 2-4% final probability.
4. **Cross-pollination working as intended:** S2-2 appropriately adjusted down from a high received base rate.
5. **Complete calibration checklists:** All agents completed meaningful checklists addressing key forecasting considerations.

### Weaknesses
1. **Base rate methodology divergence:** Agents 3 and 4 used different mathematical approaches (exponential waiting-time) that produced higher base rates without clear justification for why this approach is superior.
2. **S2-4 outlier:** The 9% final prediction stands out as potentially under-adjusted given the evidence strength.
3. **Limited exploration of surprise scenarios:** While blind spots were mentioned, the analysis of what would trigger a surprise announcement was somewhat superficial.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: A-**

The forecast demonstrates excellent research quality, sound reasoning across most agents, and appropriate final calibration. The spread (2-9%) is within acceptable bounds for a well-functioning ensemble. The single outlier (9%) at S2-4 prevents a full A grade, but the weighted average (4%) represents a well-calibrated forecast given the evidence.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
1. Add specific queries for developer forums/Discord to detect early beta signals
2. Include query for OpenAI corporate filings or regulatory submissions that might hint at timelines
3. Add query for compute infrastructure monitoring that could indicate training completion

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
1. Consider adding explicit guidance on when to use exponential waiting-time distributions vs. direct historical precedent for base rate derivation
2. Add instruction for Step 2 to explicitly justify the magnitude of adjustment from received outside view
3. Consider weighting agents differently based on their outside view methodology appropriateness

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **GPT-5.2 (Agent 3):** Could benefit from more rigorous mathematical grounding for base rate derivation
- **o3 (Agent 4):** Strong mathematical tools but should verify that chosen distribution is appropriate for the domain
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Agents 1, 2):** Consistently strong performance; consider as anchor agents
