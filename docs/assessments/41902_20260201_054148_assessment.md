# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent 5 extraction failure - 64% extracted instead of 2.8% point estimate | Critical | Aggregation | Agent 5's response ended with "Probability: 64%" referring to a confidence interval probability, but the extractor captured 64.0 as the CPI prediction instead of the stated 2.8% point estimate. This catastrophically corrupted the final aggregated prediction. |
| Final prediction of 0.15 (15.07%) is nonsensical for CPI | Critical | Aggregation | The weighted average of [3.0, 2.8, 2.85, 2.7, 64.0] produced 15.07%, which is impossible given current UK CPI of 3.4% and all legitimate agent estimates clustering around 2.7-3.0%. |
| Question mistyped as "binary" in metadata | Medium | Metadata | metadata.json shows `"type": "binary"` but this is a numeric/continuous CPI question with range -0.05% to 10.05%. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., extraction error, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## Summary

- **Question ID:** 41902
- **Question Title:** What will be the UK Consumer Prices Index (CPI) 12-month rate (year-over-year percent change) for March 2026, as reported by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)?
- **Question Type:** numeric (continuous)
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-02-01
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Forecast Window:** 89 days (approximately 3 months)
- **Final Prediction:** 15.07% (INVALID - due to extraction error)
- **Correct Final Prediction (if extraction worked):** ~2.83% (average of 3.0, 2.8, 2.85, 2.7, 2.8)
- **Step 2 Predictions:** S2-1: 3.0%, S2-2: 2.8%, S2-3: 2.85%, S2-4: 2.7%, S2-5: 2.8% (point estimate, not 64%)
- **Spread:** 0.3pp (excluding erroneous 64%)
- **Total Cost:** $1.06
- **Duration:** 373 seconds (6.2 minutes)
- **One-sentence quality assessment:** High-quality reasoning from all agents converged on 2.7-3.0% range, but a critical extraction error from Agent 5 (capturing "64%" confidence interval probability instead of "2.8%" point estimate) corrupted the final aggregation, producing an absurd 15.07% prediction.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. UK CPI historical annual rates ONS (Google)
2. Bank of England 2026 inflation forecast (Google News)
3. Provide UK CPI YoY 2010-2025 from ONS D7G7 and summarise latest BoE and OBR forecasts for headline CPI in Q1 2026, including any numeric projections for March 2026. (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. UK CPI forecast March 2026 (Google)
2. Bank of England inflation forecast 2026 (Google News)
3. Projections for UK CPI inflation in March 2026 from Bank of England, OBR, major banks [AskNews] (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Historical CPI data (2010-2025), BoE/OBR projections | Recent forecasts and current projections for March 2026 |
| Content type | Time series data, institutional projections | News, analyst forecasts, recent BoE statements |
| Unique contribution | Base rates, trend analysis, official projections | Recent MPC speeches, December 2025 actual CPI (3.4%), methodology changes |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are reasonably discrete with minimal overlap
- Historical queries successfully targeted base rate establishment through BoE/OBR forecasts
- Current queries surfaced critical recent information: December 2025 CPI (3.4%), MPC member comments (Taylor, Greene), ONS methodology change (scanner data reducing CPI ~0.03pp)
- **Critical information gap:** The actual March 2025 CPI value (needed for base effect calculation) was not prominently surfaced, though some agents inferred it (~2.6%)

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remained appropriately factual, reporting:
- Official data: December 2025 CPI 3.4%, historical trajectory
- Institutional forecasts: BoE Q1 2026 projection 3.1%, OBR 2026 average 2.5%
- Expert opinions: Alan Taylor (MPC) expecting ~2% by mid-2026, Megan Greene warning of persistence

The research did not inappropriately inject probability estimates - it correctly surfaced expert forecasts for agents to evaluate.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - December 2025 CPI: 3.4% (most recent official data)
  - BoE Q1 2026 central projection: 3.1%
  - OBR 2026 annual average: 2.5%
  - BoE expectation: "closer to 2% in April 2026"
  - ONS methodology change: scanner data from Feb 2026, ~0.03pp reduction
  - MPC member views (Taylor: optimistic, Greene: cautious)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - March 2025 actual CPI (for precise base effect calculation)
  - Full BoE fan-chart data with monthly breakdown
  - Energy futures/Ofgem price cap path details

- **Source quality:** High - predominantly official sources (ONS, BoE, OBR) with named experts from reputable outlets

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematically evaluated all 7 sources with quality ratings (Low/Medium/High), distinguished factual data from expert opinion, correctly identified BoE MPR as highest quality source. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified 4 reference classes (UK CPI trajectories post-peak, recent 2025 trajectory, BoE forecast accuracy, seasonal patterns). Selected "recent UK CPI trajectory + BoE forecasts" as most suitable given short timeframe. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly identified 2-month horizon, analyzed monthly volatility (±0.2pp), noted trajectory from 3.8% peak to 3.2-3.4% range. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Good. Arrived at 3.0% through Q1 average of 3.1% adjusted for March being final month in declining trend. Provided confidence distribution (2.8-2.9%: 15%, 3.0-3.1%: 50%, etc.). (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of 3.0% with 50% confidence in 3.0-3.1% range
- Considered distribution shape (centered, modest tails)
- Appropriately anchored on BoE Q1 projection

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Similar systematic approach to S1-1, correctly identified BoE MPR and recent CPI data as high quality, World Bank/ONS pages as low utility. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified 3 reference classes (UK CPI post-peak episodes 2008/2011/2022, BoE forecast accuracy, month-to-month changes). Selected post-peak trajectories supplemented by BoE accuracy. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly analyzed 2-month horizon, noted typical post-peak decline rates (0.6pp over 2 months for 2011), addressed non-linear path. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Good. Arrived at 2.9% through integration of Q1 average, declining trajectory, and expert opinions. Provided percentile distribution (10th: 2.4%, 50th: 2.9%, 90th: 3.5%). (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate 2.9% with well-reasoned distribution
- Correctly weighted institutional forecasts

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Evaluated all sources but less systematic than Sonnet outputs. Correctly identified key factual anchors (3.4% December, BoE guidance). (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified 3 reference classes including "near-term persistence within post-peak disinflation regime." Choice was well-suited to 2-month horizon. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Very good. Explicitly noted 59-day horizon, identified base effects and energy volatility as key drivers, correctly linked to April "closer to 2%" narrative. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Very good. Clear mechanical extrapolation from 3.4% at ~0.1pp/month decline, checked against "April near-2%" constraint. Arrived at 2.9% with 50% range 2.6-3.2%, 80% range 2.2-3.6%. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate 2.9% with explicit uncertainty ranges
- Strong integration of short-horizon constraints

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Concise but effective evaluation. Correctly identified BoE MPR and Yahoo Finance as high-quality sources. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified 3 reference classes (post-1997 inflation targeting, post-peak disinflation episodes, BoE fan-chart accuracy). Class i (long-run March mean) used for base. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly analyzed 2-month horizon, noted typical ±0.2pp monthly changes, stated 2-month window usually shifts by <0.5pp. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Interesting but potentially flawed. Used long-run March mean (2.1%) + 0.3pp adjustment = 2.4%. This seems to underweight current elevated level (3.4%). The distribution (<1%: 10%, 1-2%: 25%, 2-3%: 40%, 3-4%: 20%, >4%: 5%) is oddly shaped with 35% probability below 2%. (2/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate 2.4% appears too low given 2-month horizon from 3.4%
- Distribution has unusual shape with high probability at very low values

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Systematic evaluation, correctly weighted ONS and BoE sources. Noted BoE fan-chart historical RMSE of ~0.3pp. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Very good. Identified 3 classes (near-term drift, post-peak disinflation, BoE fan-chart performance). Chose "post-peak disinflation episodes" as best match. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent. Calculated 59-day horizon, analyzed base effect arithmetic (January/February 2025 exits), projected cumulative -0.3 to -0.4pp by March. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Very good. Step-by-step calculation: 3.4% start, -0.35pp base effects = 3.05%, +0.05pp seasonality = 3.10%, -0.05pp energy = 3.05%, rounded to 3.0%. Clear 50% CI (2.7-3.3%), 80% CI (2.4-3.6%). (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate 3.0% with rigorous mechanical derivation
- Well-calibrated uncertainty intervals

- **Score:** 15/16

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Value |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 3.0% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1 (3.0%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Used Strong/Moderate/Weak framework explicitly. Strong: ONS Dec 3.4%, BoE Q2 target 2%, OBR 2.5% avg. Moderate: ONS methodology change (-0.03pp). Weak: seasonal factors. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 3.0% → Output: 3.0%, Δ = 0pp). Justified by convergence of evidence on Q1 ~3.1% and declining trajectory. Minimal shift appropriate given consistent evidence. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Explicitly analyzed halved (February) and doubled (May) scenarios. Halved: 3.2-3.4%, Doubled: 2.3-2.7%. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate, base rate stated, consistency check ("3 out of 10 similar forecasts"), top evidence listed, blind spot identified (external shock), status quo considered. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Final 3.0% consistent with stated reasoning
- Distribution appropriately centered with modest uncertainty

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4 (2.4%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Very good. Explicit framework with detailed justification. Strong: multiple institutional forecasts (OBR 2.5%, BoE Q2 target 2%, Treasury 2.2% Q4). Moderate: ONS methodology (-0.03-0.10pp), seasonal patterns. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 2.4% → Output: 2.8%, Δ = +0.4pp). Justified shift upward because 2.4% underweighted current level (3.4%) and short timeframe limits rapid decline. Well-reasoned. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Halved: 3.1-3.3%, Doubled: 2.0-2.5%. Analysis coherent with expectations. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All elements present with meaningful content. Blind spot: energy/sterling shock. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Correctly adjusted the low S1-4 input upward based on evidence
- Final 2.8% well-justified with explicit probability distribution

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2 (2.9%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Very good. Explicit Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong: ONS 3.4%, BoE 2% Q2 target. Moderate: methodology change, base effects, food moderation. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 2.9% → Output: 2.85%, Δ = -0.05pp). Very modest adjustment justified by ONS methodology and continued disinflation. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Addressed halved (February: 3.1-3.3%) and doubled (June: 2.3-2.5%) scenarios explicitly. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Well-structured with percentile distribution (P10: 2.35%, P50: 2.85%, P90: 3.45%). Blind spot: oil/energy shock. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Final 2.85% consistent with small downward adjustment from inside view evidence
- Explicit percentile distribution well-calibrated

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 (2.9%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Concise but effective. Strong: ONS 3.4%, BOE/OBR convergence on path to 2%. Moderate: scanner data, labor market, Euro-area disinflation. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 2.9% → Output: 2.7%, Δ = -0.2pp). Justified by base effects (-0.15pp), scanner data (-0.05pp), wage cooling (-0.05pp), partially offset by tobacco duty exit (+0.05pp). Net -0.25pp rounded to 2.7%. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Concise. Noted halving increases uncertainty ~15%, doubling widens σ to ~0.45pp. (2/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Key evidence listed, blind spot (oil spike >$120), status quo check included. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Final 2.7% derived through explicit adjustment arithmetic
- Uncertainty 50% CI: 2.4-2.9%, 80% CI: 2.1-3.3%

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5 (3.0%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Strong: base effect arithmetic (-0.35pp), BoE/OBR path. Moderate: scanner data, labor market. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 3.0% → Output: 2.8%, Δ = -0.2pp). Derived through: base effects -0.35pp, seasonality +0.05pp, scanner data -0.03pp, energy -0.05pp, services stickiness +0.15pp. Net ~2.77%, rounded to 2.8%. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Basic. Noted changes if halved/doubled. (2/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Partially complete. Key evidence listed, blind spot (oil spike). However, **critical error in "Probability" line** - stated "Probability: 64%" referring to confidence interval, NOT point estimate. This caused extraction failure. (2/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Final point estimate of 2.8% clearly stated in analysis but buried
- The "Probability: 64%" line was misinterpreted by extractor as the prediction

- **Score:** 11/16 (penalized for confusing output format that caused extraction failure)

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 3.0% | 3.0% | 0pp | 13/16 | Yes - no update needed |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 2.4% | 2.8% | +0.4pp | 15/16 | Yes - corrected low input |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 2.9% | 2.85% | -0.05pp | 14/16 | Yes - minor adjustment |
| S2-4 | o3 | 2.9% | 2.7% | -0.2pp | 12/16 | Yes - explicit adjustment math |
| S2-5 | o3 | 3.0% | 2.8% | -0.2pp | 11/16 | Yes - but format caused extraction error |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4/o3's 2.4%):** Excellent engagement. Correctly identified that the 2.4% input was too low given the 2-month horizon from 3.4%, and adjusted upward by 0.4pp to 2.8%. This demonstrates the value of cross-pollination - the receiving model critically evaluated rather than blindly accepting the input.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2/Sonnet's 2.9%):** Good engagement. Made a modest -0.05pp adjustment based on additional inside view evidence. Neither over-weighted nor under-weighted the input.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3/GPT-5.2's 2.9%):** Good engagement. Made a -0.2pp adjustment through explicit adjustment arithmetic, demonstrating independent analysis while building on the input.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** Both built on their own Step 1 outputs with modest adjustments (0pp and -0.2pp respectively). The o3 instance showed more willingness to adjust.

- **Did cross-pollination increase diversity?** Yes, modestly. The final S2 outputs ranged from 2.7% to 3.0% (0.3pp spread), compared to S1 outputs ranging from 2.4% to 3.0% (0.6pp spread). Cross-pollination appeared to promote convergence toward the evidence-based consensus, particularly by correcting the outlier low estimate from S1-4.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: ONS series D7G7 for March 2026
- All correctly identified the forecast timeframe: ~2 months (February to March 2026)
- All correctly assessed current status: December 2025 CPI at 3.4%, declining from 3.8% peak

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. December 2025 CPI was 3.4% (up from 3.2% in November 2025)
2. BoE expects inflation "closer to 2% in April 2026" / ~2% by Q2 2026
3. OBR projects 2026 annual average of 2.5%
4. CPI peaked at 3.8% in July-September 2025
5. ONS implementing scanner data methodology change from February 2026

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Unusual probability distribution | Assigned 10% probability to CPI <1%, 25% to 1-2%, which seems too high given 2-month horizon from 3.4% | Medium - led to lower central estimate |
| S2-5 | Format confusion | "Probability: 64%" line was intended as confidence interval probability but extracted as point prediction | Critical - corrupted aggregation |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. All cited facts were consistent with the research sources. Some agents inferred March 2025 CPI (~2.6%) which was not directly stated in sources but is consistent with historical data.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Strong source analysis:** All agents systematically evaluated source quality, distinguishing official data from expert opinion
2. **Convergent central estimates:** Legitimate predictions clustered tightly around 2.7-3.0%, showing robust consensus
3. **Rigorous base effect analysis:** Multiple agents (especially S1-5, S2-4, S2-5) performed explicit base effect arithmetic
4. **Effective cross-pollination:** S2-2 correctly identified and adjusted for S1-4's too-low estimate
5. **Good calibration:** Uncertainty ranges (typically 50% CI of ~0.6pp) are consistent with historical CPI forecast accuracy

### Weaknesses

1. **Critical extraction failure:** Agent 5's "Probability: 64%" format was misinterpreted, corrupting the final aggregation
2. **Inconsistent output formatting:** Some agents used "Probability: X%" as point estimate, others as confidence, creating extraction risk
3. **S1-4's unusual distribution:** The 35% probability assigned to CPI <2% seems poorly calibrated given the 2-month horizon
4. **Base effect data gap:** March 2025 CPI was not explicitly surfaced in research, requiring agents to infer

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: D**

**Rationale:** The underlying reasoning across all 5 agents was strong (would merit B+ grade on analysis quality), with convergent estimates around 2.8-3.0% well-supported by evidence. However, the critical extraction error from Agent 5 that injected 64.0% into the aggregation produced a nonsensical final prediction of 15.07% for UK CPI. This renders the submitted forecast useless despite high-quality underlying analysis.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. Explicitly query for the base month (March 2025) CPI value in historical queries
2. Target BoE fan-chart data spreadsheet specifically for monthly projections

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **CRITICAL:** Standardize output format - require explicit "Point Estimate: X.XX%" on a dedicated line, separate from any confidence interval statements
2. Add extraction validation: flag any numeric predictions outside plausible range (e.g., |prediction - recent actual| > 2pp for 2-month CPI forecast)
3. Add sanity check in aggregation: if any individual prediction is >3 standard deviations from median, flag for review

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **o3 (Agent 5):** The "Probability: 64%" format at the end of the response is ambiguous. The prompt should be modified to clarify that the final "Probability" line should contain the point estimate, not confidence interval probability
- **o3 (Agent 4/S1-4):** The unusually low 2.4% estimate with high probability mass at extreme low values (<2%) seems to anchor too heavily on long-run mean (2.1%) vs current level (3.4%). Consider weighting recent data more heavily for short-horizon forecasts

---

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp (binary) / >20% of range (numeric) | No | Legitimate spread was 0.3pp (2.7-3.0%); extraction error created artificial spread |
| Update direction errors | No | All S2 updates directionally consistent with evidence |
| Factual errors present | No | Minor ambiguities only |
| Hallucinations detected | No | All facts verifiable from sources |
| Cross-pollination effective | Yes | S2-2 correctly adjusted S1-4's low estimate upward |
| Critical info missed in research | Partial | March 2025 base month CPI not explicitly surfaced |
| Base rate calculation errors | Partial | S1-4's unusually low estimate (2.4%) |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | Agent 5's extracted 64% (due to extraction error, not reasoning) |
