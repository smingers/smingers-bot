# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent 1 CDF extraction failure | High | Agent 1 | CDF generation failed with error "Cannot satisfy minimum step requirement" - only 4 of 5 agents contributed to final forecast |
| Incomplete Step 2 extraction for Agent 1 | High | S2-1 | Agent 1's step 2 output was cut off mid-response, percentiles after P20 not captured |
| Narrow distribution clustering | Medium | Aggregation | All valid agents clustered very tightly (P50 median range 12-13%), potentially underweighting uncertainty |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. melania documentary rotten tomatoes (Google)
2. melania brett ratner reviews (Google News)
3. Pull Rotten Tomatoes scores for recent politically themed documentaries; note any published reviews or social-media reactions from the 29 Jan 2026 "Melania" premiere; compare Amazon MGM doc releases with partisan subjects (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Melania documentary Rotten Tomatoes score (Google)
2. Melania film early reviews Amazon MGM (Google News)
3. Reviews of Melania documentary film by Brett Ratner after premiere in 2026 [AskNews] (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Reference class building, comparable films | Live score, recent reviews |
| Content type | Brett Ratner track record, political docs | Opening score, critic reactions |
| Unique contribution | Base rate establishment | Status quo anchor |

**Analysis:**
- Historical and current queries are **moderately discrete** - historical focused on reference classes (Ratner's films, political docs), while current focused on the live Tomatometer score
- Historical queries appropriately targeted base rate establishment through comparable politically polarizing documentaries
- Current queries successfully surfaced the critical fact that the score was 6-8% on Jan 31 and 10-11% on Feb 1
- **Gap identified:** Could have benefited from queries specifically targeting conservative media outlets' review patterns, given this was identified as a key uncertainty

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs appropriately remained factual. The historical query generator provided analysis of reference classes (Trump Card 14%, Death of a Nation 0%, etc.) but presented these as data points rather than probability estimates. The analysis noted that "Melania" being executive-produced by the subject herself "may be judged as hagiographic, which historically depresses scores" - this is appropriate contextual framing, not forecasting.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current Tomatometer: 10-11% as of Feb 1 (multiple source confirmation)
  - Score trajectory: 6% (Jan 31) → 8% → 10-11% (Feb 1)
  - Reference class: Death of a Nation 0%, Trump Card 14%, 2000 Mules 24%
  - Extreme critic-audience split (11% critics vs 99% audience)
  - All major outlets (Variety, THR, Guardian, Deadline, USA TODAY) published negative reviews

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Exact review count on RT (Agent 5 claimed 45 reviews from RT page scrape, but this wasn't consistently surfaced)
  - Specific conservative outlet review timeline predictions

- **Source quality:** High - multiple independent confirmations of core metrics from major outlets

| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (~14%) | FAILED | N/A | 12/16 | N/A (extraction failure) |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (~13%) | ~13% | 0pp | 12/16 | Yes - minimal update warranted |
| S2-3 | gpt-5.2 | S1-2 (~13%) | ~12% | -1pp | 16/16 | Yes - slight tightening |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (~12%) | ~13% | +1pp | 12/16 | Yes - small update |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (~12%) | ~12% | 0pp | 15/16 | Yes - no update needed |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3):** Engaged meaningfully with S1-4's wider distribution, maintained similar median but tightened tails slightly. Good cross-pollination.
- **S2-3 (gpt-5.2 receiving Sonnet):** Incorporated S1-2's analysis well, produced one of the best-calibrated outputs.
- **S2-4 (o3 receiving gpt-5.2):** Appropriately integrated S1-3's rigorous reference class analysis.
- **S2-5 (o3 receiving self):** Self-model cross-pollination showed minimal drift, as expected.

Cross-pollination was **moderately effective** - agents engaged with their received outside views but the high consensus among S1 outputs meant there was limited diversity to preserve. The main failure was S2-1's extraction error, which reduced effective ensemble size from 5 to 4.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (RT Tomatometer on/after Feb 13, 2026)
- All correctly identified the 12-day forecast window
- All correctly assessed the current score as 10-11%

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Current Tomatometer: 10-11% as of Feb 1, 2026
2. Score trajectory: rose from 6% (Jan 31) to 10-11% (Feb 1)
3. Reference class average: ~13% for partisan political documentaries
4. Major critics all negative (Variety, THR, Guardian, Deadline, USA TODAY)
5. Extreme audience score (99%) irrelevant to Tomatometer

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-5 | Review count claim | Claimed 45 reviews from RT page, but this wasn't confirmed by other agents | Low - didn't affect final distribution |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All cited sources were verifiable and cross-referenced.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent reference class identification** - Multiple agents independently identified the same relevant comparators (Death of a Nation, Trump Card, 2000 Mules) with calculated mean of 13%
2. **Strong source triangulation** - Multiple independent outlets confirming 10-11% score provided high-confidence anchor
3. **Appropriate right-skew** - All agents correctly recognized limited downside (can't go below 0%) with modest upside potential from conservative media reviews
4. **Rigorous evidence weighting** - Most agents applied Strong/Moderate/Weak framework effectively

### Weaknesses
1. **Agent 1 extraction failure** - Lost one agent's contribution to ensemble, reducing diversity
2. **Narrow clustering** - All valid agents produced medians within 12-13%, suggesting possible groupthink or overconfidence in the anchor
3. **Conservative media uncertainty underexplored** - While mentioned as a blind spot, could have been more systematically modeled

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The forecast demonstrates strong research quality, appropriate reference class selection, and well-calibrated uncertainty. The main deduction is for the Agent 1 extraction failure, which reduced ensemble diversity. Despite this, the remaining 4 agents produced consistent, well-reasoned distributions that appropriately anchor on the current 10-11% score with modest right-skewed uncertainty.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add explicit query for conservative media review patterns and timing
- Include query for RT review count dynamics to better model denominator changes

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Investigate cause of Agent 1 CDF extraction failure ("Cannot satisfy minimum step requirement")
- Ensure all agents produce complete percentile outputs before attempting CDF generation
- Consider requiring explicit review count estimates from all agents

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Agent 1/2):** Strong analysis but need to ensure complete output generation
- **gpt-5.2 (Agent 3):** Best overall performance, excellent mathematical rigor
- **o3 (Agent 4/5):** Good concise analysis, appropriate uncertainty ranges
