## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent 4 extreme upper tail | Medium | S1-4 / S2-4 | P90=26%, P99=45% significantly wider than other agents; may reflect overweighting of conservative media scenario |
| Agent 3 wide distribution | Medium | S1-3 | P90=34% and P80=22% suggest substantial uncertainty not shared by other agents |
| Minor: Agent 2 optimistic median | Low | S1-2 / S2-2 | Median ~15% slightly higher than others; may be overweighting "contrarian take" scenario |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

*Note: Run 2 used similar research queries to Run 1 as they share the same config. The research outputs were consistent.*

**Historical Queries:**
- Focused on reference class establishment for politically polarizing documentaries
- Brett Ratner track record and production context
- Comparable partisan documentaries (Death of a Nation, Trump Card, 2000 Mules)

**Current Queries:**
- Live Tomatometer score capture (10-11% confirmed)
- Score trajectory (6% Jan 31 → 10-11% Feb 1)
- Early review compilation from major outlets

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Reference class, comparable films | Live score, recent reviews |
| Content type | Political doc patterns, RT dynamics | Opening score, critic reactions |
| Unique contribution | Base rate (13% for partisan docs) | Status quo anchor (10-11%) |

**Analysis:**
- Research successfully surfaced the key anchor: 10-11% on ~20 reviews as of Feb 1
- Score trajectory documented: 6% (Jan 31) → 8% → 10-11% (Feb 1)
- Reference class well-established: Death of a Nation 0%, Trump Card 14%, 2000 Mules 24%
- All agents correctly noted the extreme critic-audience split (11% vs 99%)

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs remained appropriately factual. They presented the reference class data and current score without providing probability estimates. The Agent report synthesis was particularly valuable for confirming the score trajectory across multiple independent sources.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current Tomatometer: 10-11% with 20 reviews (Feb 1)
  - Historical trajectory: 6% → 8% → 10-11% over 2 days
  - Reference class: partisan political docs average ~13%, range 0-24%
  - All major critics (Variety, THR, Guardian, LAT, WaPo) already filed negative reviews
  - Documentary RT patterns: 60-90% of reviews filed in first week

- **Critical information missed:**
  - None significant - research was comprehensive

- **Source quality:** High - multiple independent confirmations across ideological spectrum (Fox News, Daily Beast, Hollywood Reporter all confirmed 10-11%)

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final Median | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3):** Successfully integrated S1-4's tighter distribution, produced well-calibrated output.
- **S2-3 (gpt-5.2 receiving Sonnet):** Appropriately adjusted down from S1-2's optimistic median (15% → 14%), demonstrating valuable cross-pollination.
- **S2-4 (o3 receiving gpt-5.2):** Inherited S1-3's wide distribution and widened it further; less effective cross-pollination.
- **S2-5 (o3 receiving self):** Maintained consistent analysis with minimal drift.

Cross-pollination was **effective overall** - agents meaningfully engaged with received outside views. The best example was S2-3 correcting S1-2's optimistic bias. All 5 agents successfully contributed to the ensemble.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (RT Tomatometer on/after Feb 13, 2026)
- All correctly identified the 12-day forecast window
- All correctly assessed the current score as 10-11% with ~20 reviews

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Current Tomatometer: 10-11% as of Feb 1, 2026 (confirmed by multiple sources)
2. Review count: ~20 reviews as of Feb 1
3. Score trajectory: rose from 6% (Jan 31) to 10-11% (Feb 1)
4. Reference class: partisan political docs, median ~13-14%
5. Major critics all filed negative reviews
6. Extreme audience score (99%) irrelevant to Tomatometer

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| None significant | N/A | All agents converged on same factual base | N/A |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All cited sources were verifiable and cross-referenced.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Complete 5-agent ensemble** - All agents successfully extracted, providing full diversity
2. **Excellent source triangulation** - Multiple independent confirmations of 10-11% score across ideological spectrum
3. **Strong statistical rigor** - Agent 5 used Monte Carlo simulation; multiple agents cited 56-film reference class
4. **Effective cross-pollination** - S2-3 appropriately corrected S1-2's optimistic bias
5. **Well-calibrated uncertainty** - Most agents produced similar distributions centered on 12-13%

### Weaknesses
1. **Agent 4 extreme upper tail** - P99=45% seems excessive given strong negative consensus
2. **Minor optimism in some agents** - S1-2 and S2-3 slightly higher than others
3. **Could have explored conservative media scenario more systematically** - Mentioned as blind spot but not modeled explicitly

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: A-**

This run demonstrates excellent forecast quality with all 5 agents contributing successfully. Research was comprehensive, reference classes were well-defined, and the ensemble produced a well-calibrated distribution. The only deductions are for Agent 4's extreme upper tail and minor optimism in some agents. This run is superior to Run 1 due to the complete 5-agent ensemble.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- None significant - research was comprehensive

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Consider constraining upper tails when current score is well-established (prevent P99=45% when current is 11%)
- Could add explicit sanity check for tail probabilities relative to current anchor

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Agent 1/2):** Strong, consistent performance
- **gpt-5.2 (Agent 3):** Good structure, could tighten upper tail
- **o3 (Agent 4/5):** Agent 5 excellent with Monte Carlo; Agent 4 needs tighter calibration
