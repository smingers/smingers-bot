# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Anomalous CDF shape | HIGH | Final aggregation | The aggregated CDF shows an unusual bimodal pattern with nearly all probability mass concentrated at the extreme tails (1% at low end, 99% at high end), with median at ~3% - this does not match the forecaster distributions |
| Forecaster CDFs not integrated | MODERATE | Aggregation | Individual forecaster distributions are centered around 1875-1880 but final CDF places 50th percentile at ~3% of the normalized range |

- Agentic search effectively provided the API download method and confirmed the most recent data point
- Gap: Could have explicitly queried for 10-day historical volatility statistics

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Latest index value (1876.280 on Jan 29, 2026) - critical anchor
  - Effective yield (6.52%) enabling carry calculations
  - February Treasury seasonality from BofA (65% rising yields)
  - Expert views from J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity on macro environment
  - ETF flow data (SPHY) indicating institutional positioning
- **Critical information missed:** None critical; base rate volatility was inferred rather than directly retrieved
- **Source quality:** High - FRED primary source, major investment banks, reputable financial news

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Median Est. | 10th pctl | 90th pctl | Score | Key Strength |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~1877 | 1859 | 1897 | 14/16 | Strong carry calculation (+0.18%), appropriate volatility |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~1877 | 1848 | 1910 | 13/16 | Detailed volatility estimation (0.4% daily, 1.33% 11-day) |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~1881 | 1828 | 1930 | 12/16 | Wide tails acknowledging fat-tail credit risk |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~1880 | 1860 | 1905 | 14/16 | Clean statistical framework (sigma-adjusted for tails) |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~1880 | 1848 | 1912 | 13/16 | Solid reference class (2010-2025 10-day returns) |

**Key observations:**
- Excellent ensemble agreement: all medians cluster within 1877-1881 range
- All forecasters correctly anchored on latest value (1876.280) and applied carry adjustment
- Volatility estimates ranged from 0.6% to 1.2% for 10-day horizon - appropriate range
- All properly identified the short timeframe (11 days) as limiting tail risk
- F3 (GPT-5.2) showed widest distribution - appropriate for credit risk asymmetry

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Final Median | 10th pctl | 90th pctl | 80% CI Width | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~1878 | 1857 | 1899 | ~$32 | Yes - minimal update, added carry/seasonality considerations |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~1877 | 1863 | 1893 | ~$25 | Yes - incorporated February seasonality (slight bearish bias) |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~1872 | 1830 | 1915 | ~$55 | Yes - shifted median down on Feb seasonality, widened left tail |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~1882 | 1825 | 1932 | ~$80 | Yes - incorporated overbought signals, wider uncertainty |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~1880 | 1848 | 1913 | ~$55 | Yes - balanced carry vs seasonality |

**Distribution Analysis:**
- Forecaster medians show excellent convergence (1872-1882)
- F2 and F3 appropriately shifted median slightly lower on February seasonality evidence
- F4 maintained wider distribution reflecting BofA "overbought" warning
- 80% CI widths range from $25-$80 - appropriate variance for different risk assessments
- All individual CDFs are well-formed with proper monotonicity

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- Cross-model diversity maintained: Sonnet instances more conservative, o3 instances allowed wider tails
- February seasonality evidence was incorporated consistently across forecasters
- Carry calculations converged (~+0.18-0.20% over 11 days)
- Despite different model families, final predictions converged tightly (within $10)
- Cross-pollination appeared effective in ensuring consistent evidence interpretation

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- Resolution source: FRED series BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV
- Resolution date: Feb 13, 2026
- Price range bounds: 1439.65 - 2161.42
- Units: Index (total return, not yield)
- Latest value: 1876.280 (Jan 29, 2026)

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified across forecasters:
1. Latest index value: 1876.280 (Jan 29, 2026) - verified via FRED
2. Effective yield: ~6.52% enabling carry calculation of ~0.18% over 11 days
3. Historical 10-day volatility: 0.6-1.2% depending on methodology
4. February Treasury seasonality: 65% chance of rising yields (BofA)
5. Current macro environment: stable (Fed on pause, solid growth, no imminent credit stress)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

- Minor inconsistency: Some forecasters used 9 trading days, others 11 calendar days - both reasonable interpretations
- F3 used slightly wider tail estimates than historical data would support, but this reflects appropriate caution

### Hallucinations

None detected. All factual claims were traceable to research sources.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong research foundation** - Correctly identified FRED data source and retrieved latest anchor value
2. **Excellent forecaster agreement** - All 5 forecasters within $10 median range despite different models
3. **Appropriate carry incorporation** - All calculated ~0.18-0.20% carry over 11 days
4. **Evidence-based adjustments** - February seasonality correctly incorporated as modest headwind
5. **Valid individual CDFs** - All 5 forecaster outputs well-formed with proper monotonicity

### Weaknesses
1. **CRITICAL: Aggregated CDF appears malformed** - The final prediction.json shows a bimodal distribution with ~1% probability at low end and ~99% at high end, with median at ~3% of the normalized range. This does not match the forecaster distributions (medians around 1877-1882).
2. **Potential aggregation bug** - The percentiles in prediction.json (1st: 0.01, 50th: 0.031, 99th: 0.993) appear to be normalized positions rather than properly aggregated CDFs
3. Minor: Some forecasters could have been more precise about the 9 vs 11 day distinction

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| **D** | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: D**

While the individual forecaster outputs demonstrate excellent reasoning and appropriate calibration for this short-horizon fixed income forecast, the critical aggregation issue renders the final submitted CDF unreliable. The forecasters correctly identified the expected range (approximately 1857-1915 for 10th-90th percentile), but the submitted prediction appears to have a processing error that places probability mass at the extremes of the question range rather than around the forecasted values.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Directly query for 10-day historical volatility statistics from FRED or other statistical sources
- Include query for current credit spread levels (OAS) for more precise risk assessment

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **CRITICAL: Investigate CDF aggregation logic** - The final CDF does not reflect the forecaster outputs
- Verify CDF generation is properly mapping percentile estimates to the question's continuous range
- Add validation step to ensure aggregated CDF medians match individual forecaster medians

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Strong performance, appropriately conservative uncertainty bands
- **GPT-5.2:** Good incorporation of tail risk, slightly wider than others but defensible
- **o3:** Solid statistical framework, good balance of evidence integration
