## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Bank of America stock February performance (Google)
2. Bank of America 2026 outlook analysts (Google News)
3. Summarize BAC historical early-to-mid-February price changes since 2010; list scheduled events between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-15; provide recent analyst target revisions (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Bank of America stock February 2026 (Google)
2. Bank of America Q4 2025 earnings (Google News)
3. Latest forecasts for Bank of America share price and macro factors through mid-February 2026 (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Feb 1-15 patterns 2010-2025; scheduled events | Feb 2026 price, recent earnings, near-term catalysts |
| Content type | Seasonality data, base rates | Current news, sentiment, macro calendar |
| Unique contribution | 56% historical win rate (9/16), +$0.18 mean gain | Buffett sale narrative, recent -5% decline, CPI/payrolls dates |

**Analysis:**
- Excellent query differentiation for a binary stock question
- Historical queries correctly targeted the specific timeframe pattern (Feb 1-15)
- Agent report provided exceptional value: detailed year-by-year price changes, 9/16 up frequency, scheduled events calendar
- Current queries surfaced the key narrative driver (Buffett's 45% position reduction published Feb 2)
- Gap: Some AskNews results returned irrelevant cryptocurrency data ("Basis Cash" BAC-USD) which forecasters correctly identified and excluded

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Historical base rate: 56% (9/16) for Feb 1-15 period, 80% in recent 5 years
  - Current price: ~$53.20 (Jan 30 close)
  - Recent momentum: -5.3% decline Jan 11-30
  - Macro calendar: Payrolls Feb 6, CPI Feb 11, CEO remarks Feb 10
  - Buffett sale disclosure timing (Feb 2, baseline date)
  - Analyst targets: $57-63 range
- **Critical information successfully identified:** Forecasters correctly noted the absence of earnings/dividends in the window
- **Source quality issues:** AskNews returned cryptocurrency noise; Market Chameleon returned error page

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Outside View | Score | Key Methodology |
|--------|-------|--------------|-------|-----------------|
| F1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 64% | 15/16 | Started from 56% base, adjusted for recent trends, analyst support |
| F2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 57% | 14/16 | Weighted 80% recent rate + 56% base, adjusted for contrarian signals |
| F3 | GPT-5.2 | 55% | 14/16 | Anchored to 56%, shrunk toward 52-54% for small-n |
| F4 | o3 | 56% | 15/16 | Pure base rate (56%) with minimal adjustment |
| F5 | o3 | 55% | 14/16 | 56% base with -1% credit spread, -1% no catalyst, +1% sentiment |

**Key Observations:**
- Strong consensus on historical base rate: all forecasters anchored to 56% (9/16 wins)
- Sonnet instances showed wider range (57-64%), o3 instances more conservative (55-56%)
- All correctly identified the key reference class (BAC Feb 1-15 historical performance)
- All noted the recent 5-year improvement (80% win rate)
- Appropriate source skepticism demonstrated (cryptocurrency data correctly ignored)

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Final Prob | Inside View Stated | Extracted | Delta | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| F1 | Sonnet 4.5 | **6.4%** | 47% | 6.4% | **-40.6pp ERROR** | N/A - Extraction failure |
| F2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 52% | 52% | 52% | -5pp | Yes - recent momentum, Buffett narrative |
| F3 | GPT-5.2 | 55% | 55% | 55% | 0pp | Yes - minimal update from outside view |
| F4 | o3 | 51% | 51% | 51% | -4pp | Yes - momentum/Buffett adjustments |
| F5 | o3 | 52% | 52% | 52% | -3pp | Yes - momentum/supply concerns |

**Distribution Analysis:**
- **Valid forecasters (F2-F5):** Range 51-55%, Mean 52.5%, Spread 4pp
- **Erroneous forecaster (F1):** Stated 47% in text, extracted as 6.4%
- All valid forecasters converged on ~50-55% (slightly positive odds)
- Consistent inside-view adjustments: recent bearish momentum and Buffett selling narrative justified -2 to -5pp from outside view

### Extraction Error Analysis

**Forecaster 1 (agent_1_step2.md):**
- Text clearly states: "Final probability: 47%"
- Reasoning concludes: "47 out of 100 times, BAC closes higher on Feb 15 than Feb 2"
- The extracted value (6.4%) appears to come from: "BAC fell $56.17 to $52.59 (-6.4%)" mentioned in the reasoning
- This is a **critical extraction failure** - the regex/parser mistook a statistic about January price decline for the forecast probability

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- All 5 forecasters received consistent historical context through the shared step1_prompt
- Despite different model families, valid forecasters converged tightly (51-55%)
- Cross-model diversity preserved: Sonnet slightly higher (52%), o3 slightly lower (51-52%)
- F1's outside view (64%) was the highest, but its inside view correctly adjusted down to 47% - this update was reasonable given the negative momentum evidence
- The extraction failure negated the value of cross-pollination for F1

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- Resolution mechanism: Yahoo Finance API close price comparison
- Comparison dates: Feb 2 vs Feb 15, 2026
- Short timeframe: ~9 trading days
- Binary nature: higher = Yes, lower/equal = No

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified across forecasters:
1. Historical base rate: 56% (9/16) for Feb 1-15 period 2010-2025
2. Recent 5-year rate: 80% (4/5) positive
3. Current price: ~$53 (Jan 30 close)
4. 52-week range: $33.07 - $57.55
5. Key events: Payrolls Feb 6, CPI Feb 11, CEO remarks Feb 10
6. No earnings or ex-dividend in window
7. Buffett sold 45% of stake (July 2024 - Sept 2025)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

- F2 noted: "Feb 15, 2026 is a Sunday, so resolution will likely use the most recent market close, plausibly Feb 13" - Good catch on calendar awareness
- All forecasters correctly identified and excluded irrelevant AskNews cryptocurrency results

### Hallucinations

None detected across all 5 forecasters.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research utilization** - Agent report provided high-quality historical data (56% base rate) that all forecasters correctly leveraged
2. **Strong source discrimination** - All forecasters identified and excluded irrelevant cryptocurrency data
3. **Appropriate uncertainty** - 51-55% range reflects genuine uncertainty over a 9-trading-day window
4. **Consistent methodology** - All forecasters used historical base rate + inside-view adjustments
5. **Good factual accuracy** - No hallucinations detected; key dates and prices verified across sources

### Weaknesses
1. **CRITICAL: Extraction failure** - F1's 47% probability was extracted as 6.4%, severely distorting the final aggregation
2. **Aggregation impact** - Final 43.28% is ~9pp lower than the true consensus (~52%)
3. **No extraction validation** - Pipeline did not flag the 6.4% as an obvious outlier (45pp below the stated inside view)

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| **B** | **Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling** |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B (would be A- without extraction error)**

The forecasting reasoning across all 5 forecasters was strong - proper base rate identification, appropriate inside-view adjustments, and correct source skepticism. However, the critical extraction error in F1 undermines the final output reliability. The submitted 43.28% is likely ~9pp too low compared to the true ensemble consensus.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Extraction/Pipeline Improvements
1. **Add outlier detection**: Flag extracted probabilities that differ >20pp from the median of other forecasters
2. **Validate against stated probability**: Compare extracted value to explicit probability statements in the text (e.g., "Final probability: X%")
3. **Avoid extracting percentages from reasoning context**: The "-6.4%" was a statistic about price decline, not a forecast; improve regex to target probability statements specifically
4. **Add sanity bounds**: For binary questions, flag any extraction <10% or >90% for manual review when other forecasters are near 50%

### Research Improvements
- AskNews query for stock questions should exclude cryptocurrency results (ticker disambiguation)
- Consider adding explicit current price query at forecast time

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F1, F2):** Strong reasoning; F1's extraction issue is pipeline-side, not model quality
- **GPT-5.2 (F3):** Conservative, well-calibrated approach
- **o3 (F4, F5):** Tight convergence, minimal unnecessary adjustments

---

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Extraction failures | **YES** | F1 extracted 6.4% instead of stated 47% |
| Output spread >20% | **YES** | 6.4% vs 55% = 48.6pp spread (due to extraction error) |
| Factual errors present | No | All factual claims verified |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Valid forecasters converged; F1 error negated its value |
| Critical info missed in research | No | Historical base rate and key events captured |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All correctly identified 56% (9/16) |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | **YES** | F1's 6.4% is ~3 SD below the valid mean of 52.5% |
