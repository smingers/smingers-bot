## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. DGS5 yield January 2026 data (Google)
2. 5-year Treasury yield February outlook (Google News)
3. Provide recent DGS5 values December 2025-January 2026 and market commentary on drivers and forecasts for five-year Treasury yield through February 10 2026 (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. 5 year Treasury yield February 2026 (Google)
2. Fed rate expectations February 2026 yields (Google News)
3. Expectations for US 5-year Treasury yield direction through mid-February 2026 after January jobs report and latest Fed meeting (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Dec 2025-Jan 2026 data points | Real-time market drivers, Feb 2026 outlook |
| Content type | Daily yield values, recent range | Fed policy, economic calendar, analyst forecasts |
| Unique contribution | Volatility baseline (16bp Jan range) | Payroll risk (Feb 7), FOMC hold implications |

**Analysis:**
- Good query differentiation overall
- Historical queries successfully retrieved comprehensive DGS5 daily data (Dec-Jan)
- Current queries surfaced Fed policy context and near-term catalysts
- Gap: Both query sets had some overlap (both asked about "February outlook")
- Strength: Agent report provided excellent synthesis with specific daily values and expert consensus corridor (3.75% +/- 0.10%)

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Latest DGS5 value: 3.79% (Jan 30, 2026)
  - January range: 3.70%-3.86%
  - Fed held rates at Jan 28-29 meeting
  - No major data releases before Feb 10 (CPI is Feb 13)
  - Expert consensus: 3.60%-4.00% range for early Q1
- **Critical information captured:** All material drivers for 8-day forecast
- **Source quality:** High - FRED/YCharts data, Bankrate, Deloitte, BlackRock commentary

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Median Est. | 10th pctl | 90th pctl | Score | Key Strength |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~3.79% | 3.68% | 3.91% | 14/16 | Tight distribution anchored to current value |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~3.78% | 3.66% | 3.92% | 14/16 | Good historical volatility analysis |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~3.79% | 3.60% | 3.99% | 13/16 | Wider tails, fat-tail consideration |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~3.80% | 3.62% | 3.98% | 13/16 | Explicit normal + exponential tail modeling |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~3.79% | 3.55% | 4.05% | 12/16 | Widest tails, accounts for payrolls risk |

**Key observations:**
- Excellent ensemble agreement on central tendency (~3.78-3.80%)
- All forecasters correctly anchored to 3.79% (Jan 30 value)
- Distribution widths vary: Sonnet instances tighter (90th ~3.91-3.92%), o3 instances wider (90th ~3.98-4.05%)
- All properly identified the 8-day, 6-trading-day horizon
- Reference class selection consistent: recent-regime 5-year yield volatility

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Final Median | 10th pctl | 90th pctl | 80% CI Width | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~3.78% | 3.70% | 3.88% | ~0.14% | Yes - minimal update appropriate |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | FAILED | - | - | - | N/A - extraction error |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~3.77% | 3.60% | 3.96% | ~0.28% | Yes - widened tails for event risk |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~3.79% | 3.55% | 3.99% | ~0.35% | Yes - maintained fat tails |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~3.79% | 3.55% | 4.05% | ~0.40% | Yes - payrolls risk incorporated |

**Distribution Analysis:**
- 4 of 5 forecasters produced valid, monotonic CDFs
- F2 (Sonnet 4.5) failed: response truncated at "5. **Blind" in checklist section, no Distribution block
- Remaining forecasters show good convergence on median (~3.77-3.79%)
- 80% CI widths range from 0.14% to 0.40% - appropriate for 8-day Treasury forecast
- o3 instances consistently allowed for wider tails than Sonnet/GPT instances

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- Cross-pollination structure was applied but one link broken due to F2 failure
- Despite different input perspectives, valid forecasters converged tightly on central estimates
- Model family differences visible:
  - Sonnet 4.5 (F1): Most conservative, tightest distribution
  - GPT-5.2 (F3): Moderate width, good tail calibration
  - o3 (F4, F5): Widest tails, more uncertainty
- F2 failure reduced the benefit of cross-pollination diversity
- Impact: Lost one Sonnet 4.5 perspective in final aggregation

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All valid forecasters correctly understood:
- Resolution source: FRED series DGS5
- Resolution date: Feb 10, 2026
- Forecast horizon: 8 calendar days / 6 trading days
- Price range bounds: 3.026% - 5.038% (open on both ends)
- Units: Percent

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified across forecasters:
1. Latest DGS5 = 3.79% (Jan 30, 2026)
2. January range: 3.70%-3.86%
3. December range: 3.57%-3.78%
4. Fed held rates at Jan 28-29 FOMC meeting at 3.50%-3.75%
5. No major data releases before resolution (CPI Feb 13 is after)
6. Historical 6-day volatility ~8-12 bp
7. Expert consensus corridor: 3.75% +/- 0.10%

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

None identified among valid forecasters.

### Hallucinations

None detected. All cited sources and data points were verifiable from research context.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Tight ensemble agreement** - All 4 valid forecasters within 0.02% median range
2. **Appropriate uncertainty quantification** - 80% CIs of 0.14%-0.40% reasonable for 8-day horizon
3. **Excellent research quality** - Comprehensive daily data, expert consensus captured
4. **Strong anchoring** - All forecasters properly anchored to 3.79% current value
5. **Good event calendar awareness** - Correctly identified payrolls (Feb 7) as only near-term catalyst

### Weaknesses
1. **Critical extraction failure** - F2 (Sonnet 4.5) failed, reducing ensemble from 5 to 4 forecasters
2. **Reduced diversity** - Lost one of two Sonnet perspectives
3. **Query overlap** - Some redundancy between historical and current query sets
4. **Truncation issue** - F2 response cut off mid-checklist, suggesting possible output length issue

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| **B** | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

The forecast demonstrates solid execution with excellent research and tight ensemble agreement among valid forecasters. However, the grade is reduced from A due to the critical extraction failure that eliminated 20% of the ensemble. The remaining 4 forecasters produced high-quality, well-reasoned outputs.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add explicit query for current spot price confirmation
- Include query for Treasury auction calendar and demand metrics

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Investigate F2 truncation**: Response appears cut off at checklist - may need increased max_output_tokens for Sonnet 4.5 on step2
- Add extraction retry logic when percentile block is missing
- Consider fallback to outside view percentiles if inside view extraction fails

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F1):** Excellent - tightest, well-calibrated distribution
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F2):** Needs investigation - response truncation caused extraction failure
- **GPT-5.2 (F3):** Good - balanced width, appropriate tail calibration
- **o3 (F4, F5):** Good - appropriately wider tails for uncertainty
