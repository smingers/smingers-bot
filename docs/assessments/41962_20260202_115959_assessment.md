## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Nikkei 225 historical data 2025 (Google)
2. Nikkei 225 February 2026 outlook (Google News)
3. Provide daily Nikkei 225 closes 2020-2026, recent BOJ policy context, and major news likely to impact index before 13 Feb 2026 (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Nikkei 225 outlook February 2026 (Google)
2. Nikkei 225 record highs yen (Google News)
3. Latest analysis of Bank of Japan policy impact on Nikkei 225 for early February 2026 (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2020-2025 price patterns, BOJ policy timeline | Current prices, Feb 2026 catalysts |
| Content type | Volatility metrics, base rates, policy history | Market drivers, election impact, sector moves |
| Unique contribution | 10-day volatility baseline, reference class data | BoJ hawkish signals, election timing, tech selloff |

**Analysis:**
- Good query differentiation: historical focused on multi-year price data and policy context, current on near-term catalysts
- Historical queries appropriately targeted the FRED series and BOJ meeting schedule
- Current queries captured key drivers: Feb 8 snap election, BOJ Summary of Opinions, semiconductor weakness
- Minor gap: Could have explicitly queried for options-implied volatility or VIX-equivalent for more precise uncertainty calibration

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current Nikkei level (52,655 close on Feb 2)
  - Recent all-time high (54,499 in mid-January 2026)
  - Feb 8 snap election with Takaichi at 70%+ approval
  - BOJ rate at 0.75%, next meeting March 18-19 (after resolution)
  - 10-year JGB yields at decade-high 2.32%
  - Semiconductor sector weakness (-4% to -14% on Feb 2)
  - USD/JPY at ~155 (weak yen supporting exporters)
- **Critical information captured:** Election binary risk, BOJ hawkish signals, intraday volatility pattern (Feb 2 swung +924 then reversed)
- **Source quality:** High - Nikkei, CNBC, Kyodo News, FRED, AskNews Japanese press

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Final Median | 90th pctl | 80% CI Width | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~52,850 | 55,000 | ~3,200 | Yes - election reduces tail risk |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~52,500 | 56,000 | ~4,300 | Yes - BOJ hawkish tilt adds downside |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~52,800 | 55,800 | ~3,950 | Yes - widens tails for event risk |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~53,400 | 57,000 | ~4,000 | Yes - adds drift for election optimism |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~52,800 | 55,500 | ~4,200 | Yes - balances tech weakness vs yen |

**Distribution Analysis:**
- All forecasters produced well-behaved, monotonic CDFs
- 80% CI widths range from ~3,200-4,300 points (6-8% of current level) - appropriate for 11-day equity index with election
- F4 (o3) has slight upward bias reflecting election optimism
- F2 (Sonnet) shows more downside weight due to BOJ hawkish signals
- No CDF extraction failures

**Percentile Distribution Comparison:**

| Percentile | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 | F5 | Spread |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| 1st | 48,000 | 47,500 | 47,000 | 47,000 | 47,000 | 1,000 |
| 10th | 51,000 | 49,500 | 49,750 | 50,500 | 50,200 | 1,500 |
| 50th (interp.) | 52,850 | 52,500 | 52,800 | 53,400 | 52,800 | 900 |
| 90th | 55,000 | 56,000 | 55,800 | 57,000 | 55,500 | 2,000 |
| 99th | 57,500 | 58,200 | 58,800 | 60,000 | 59,000 | 2,500 |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- All cross-model instances produced valid outputs
- Despite different input perspectives, final predictions converged tightly at median
- Model family differences visible:
  - **Sonnet 4.5 (F1, F2):** More focused on technical support/resistance levels
  - **GPT-5.2 (F3):** Balanced approach with explicit volatility regime analysis
  - **o3 (F4, F5):** Concise base-rate derivations with clear calibration anchors
- Cross-pollination appears to have contributed to convergence without over-smoothing
- Tail distributions show appropriate diversity: F4 has widest upside tail (60,000 at 99th), F2 has widest downside consideration

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- Resolution source: FRED series NIKKEI225
- Resolution date: Feb 13, 2026
- Price range bounds: 28,265.25 - 61,983.46 (Index points)
- Current level: ~52,655 (Feb 2, 2026 close)

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified across forecasters:
1. Nikkei 225 current level: 52,655 (Feb 2 close)
2. Recent all-time high: 54,487-54,499 (mid-January 2026)
3. BOJ policy rate: 0.75% (held at Jan 22 meeting)
4. Feb 8 snap election: Key binary event within forecast window
5. No BOJ meeting before Feb 13 (next is March 18-19)
6. USD/JPY: ~155 (weak yen supporting exporters)
7. Historical 7-10 day volatility: ~3.5-4% standard deviation

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

- **Minor inconsistency:** One source cited BOJ rate at 0.7% (TradingView) vs. 0.75% (CNBC, AskNews). Forecasters correctly identified 0.75% as authoritative.
- **Minor:** Some sources showed Feb 2 level as 53,250 (intraday) vs. 52,655 (close). Forecasters appropriately anchored on closing price.

### Hallucinations

None detected.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent ensemble agreement** - All 5 forecasters within ~900 point median range (~1.7% spread)
2. **Appropriate uncertainty quantification** - 80% CIs of 6-8% reasonable for 11-day equity index with election
3. **Well-differentiated research** - Historical (base rates, volatility) vs current (election, BOJ, sector moves) properly separated
4. **No extraction failures** - All 5 CDFs valid and well-formed
5. **Proper event-risk handling** - Feb 8 election correctly identified as key volatility catalyst
6. **Strong source analysis** - All forecasters distinguished between factual data (Nikkei, Kyodo, CNBC) and opinion (broker targets, model forecasts)
7. **Explicit base-rate reasoning** - Historical 7-10 day volatility statistics clearly stated and applied

### Weaknesses
1. Minor: Could have included options-implied volatility for more precise uncertainty calibration
2. Minor: Some redundancy in forecaster reasoning around election impact
3. Minor: Final aggregated CDF appears to have very narrow lower percentiles (1st-50th all below 0.02), suggesting possible CDF generation issue with heavy right-skew

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **A** | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: A-**

This is a strong forecast execution with tight ensemble agreement, appropriate uncertainty for the timeframe and event risk, and well-structured reasoning. The minor deduction is for the final CDF shape appearing heavily right-skewed in the aggregated output (percentiles 1-50 compressed near 0.01-0.02), which may indicate a CDF generation artifact rather than a substantive forecasting issue.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Include explicit query for VIX Japan or Nikkei options implied volatility
- Add query for detailed election polling data and seat projections

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Review CDF aggregation to ensure final distribution shape reflects individual forecaster distributions appropriately
- Consider adding explicit percentile consistency check in aggregation step

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F1, F2):** Strong technical analysis integration; could reduce redundancy between outside/inside view
- **GPT-5.2 (F3):** Good volatility regime analysis; timeframe analysis well-structured
- **o3 (F4, F5):** Concise and well-calibrated; appropriate drift assumptions
