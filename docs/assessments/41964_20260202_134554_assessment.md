## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. 3-month Treasury yield January 2026 trend (Google)
2. Fed funds target range January 2026 (Google News)
3. DGS3MO daily values Jan-Feb 2026 and Fed meeting schedule (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. 3 month Treasury yield forecast (Google)
2. 3-month T-bill yield outlook (Google News)
3. What analysts expect for 3-month Treasury bill yields after February 2026 Fed meeting (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Jan 2026 trends, Fed policy context | Near-term forecasts, analyst expectations |
| Content type | Policy rate anchors, recent yield levels | Forward-looking outlooks, market consensus |
| Unique contribution | Fed funds target 3.50-3.75%, current yield 3.67% | Analyst projections, auction trends |

**Analysis:**
- Good query differentiation: historical focused on establishing current state and policy context, current on forward expectations
- Historical queries correctly identified the Fed funds anchor and recent yield levels
- Current queries captured analyst consensus on gradual easing expectations
- Strength: Both query sets converged on the critical fact that Fed is on hold until March

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current 3-month yield: 3.67% (Trading Economics, CNBC)
  - Fed funds target range: 3.50-3.75% (unchanged until March 2026)
  - Recent bill auction: 3.580% (Jan 26, 2026)
  - Next FOMC meeting: March 17-18, 2026
  - Market consensus: only ~50-60 bp of cuts expected in 2026
- **Critical information appropriately weighted:** Forecasters correctly identified that the short 8-day window with no Fed meeting means yield should remain anchored near current levels
- **Source quality:** High - Official Treasury data, Fed policy statements, reputable financial data providers

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Final Median | 90th pctl | 80% CI Width | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~3.68% | 3.84% | 17 bp | Yes - minimal update from outside view |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~3.62% | 3.80% | 20 bp | Yes - slight downward shift toward auction level |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~3.68% | 3.84% | 22 bp | Yes - incorporated auction data appropriately |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~3.64% | 3.88% | 26 bp | Yes - wider tails for macro surprise risk |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~3.64% | 3.86% | 26 bp | Yes - consistent with outside view plus payrolls risk |

**Distribution Analysis:**
- All forecasters produced well-behaved, monotonic percentile distributions
- Medians tightly clustered: 3.62-3.68% (6 bp spread)
- 80% CI widths: 17-26 bp - appropriate for 8-day Treasury bill forecast
- Consistent identification of key risk: January payrolls (Feb 7) as main potential volatility source
- No CDF extraction failures

### Percentile Comparison Table

| Percentile | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 | F5 | Spread |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1st | 3.35 | 3.35 | 3.28 | 3.20 | 3.35 | 15 bp |
| 10th | 3.54 | 3.46 | 3.52 | 3.45 | 3.46 | 9 bp |
| 50th | ~3.68 | ~3.62 | ~3.68 | ~3.64 | ~3.64 | 6 bp |
| 90th | 3.84 | 3.80 | 3.84 | 3.88 | 3.86 | 8 bp |
| 99th | 4.05 | 4.00 | 4.20 | 4.20 | 4.05 | 20 bp |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- All cross-model instances produced valid outputs
- Tight convergence across all forecasters despite different model families
- Model family differences minimal: Sonnet 4.5 and o3 both converged to similar distributions
- Cross-pollination appeared to reinforce consensus around the 3.64-3.68% median range
- Effective sharing of key analytical insights (Fed anchor, auction data, volatility calculations)

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- Resolution source: FRED series DGS3MO
- Resolution date: Feb 10, 2026
- Price range bounds: 3.077% - 5.1175% (percent units)
- Timeframe: 8 calendar days / 6 trading days

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified across forecasters:
1. Current 3-month yield: ~3.67% (Feb 2, 2026)
2. Fed funds target range: 3.50-3.75% (held at January 2026 meeting)
3. Next FOMC meeting: March 17-18, 2026 (no policy change possible before resolution)
4. Recent bill auction: 3.580% (Jan 26, 2026)
5. Historical daily volatility: ~4 bp standard deviation
6. 6-day cumulative volatility: ~10 bp standard deviation

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

- **Minor issue:** One forecaster (F3) noted the YCharts/Philadelphia Fed forecast of 1.35% for Q1 2026 as "likely erroneous or different metric" - correctly identified and discounted
- **Appropriate skepticism:** Financial Forecast Center prediction of 3.37% was appropriately weighted as low-quality evidence

### Hallucinations

None detected. All factual claims were traceable to the research sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent ensemble agreement** - All 5 forecasters within 6 bp median range
2. **Strong analytical foundation** - Correct identification of Fed funds anchor and short-horizon dynamics
3. **Appropriate uncertainty quantification** - 80% CIs of 17-26 bp consistent with historical volatility
4. **No extraction failures** - All 5 forecaster CDFs valid and well-formed
5. **High-quality research synthesis** - Key facts correctly surfaced and weighted
6. **Statistical rigor** - Multiple forecasters performed explicit volatility calculations

### Weaknesses
1. **CRITICAL: Aggregation bug** - Final prediction.json CDF shows anomalous distribution (~98% probability above median) that does not match the individual forecaster outputs
2. **Minor:** Could have explicitly noted the specific payrolls release date (Feb 7) more prominently as the main risk factor

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| **C** | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: C (would be A without aggregation bug)**

The individual forecaster outputs are exemplary: tight ensemble agreement, appropriate uncertainty bands, excellent factual grounding, and sound reasoning. However, the final submitted CDF appears to have a critical aggregation bug that invalidates the forecast. The prediction.json shows percentiles suggesting the median outcome is at the very bottom of the forecaster distributions (around 3.08-3.20), which contradicts all five forecasters who centered their distributions around 3.64-3.68%.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Critical Bug Investigation
- **Investigate CDF aggregation logic** - The final CDF in prediction.json does not match the expected weighted average of the 5 forecaster distributions
- The percentiles in prediction.json (e.g., P50 = 0.98 in CDF space) suggest the values are being mapped incorrectly to the question's range

### Research Improvements
- Include explicit query for current spot price at exact forecast time
- Add query for SOFR futures implied volatility for more precise uncertainty calibration

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Add validation step to confirm aggregated CDF percentiles are consistent with input forecaster percentiles
- Include sanity check that final median is within the range of individual forecaster medians

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Excellent performance - clear reasoning, appropriate updates
- **GPT-5.2:** Good analysis but slightly wider tails than peers
- **o3:** Strong statistical rigor in volatility calculations
