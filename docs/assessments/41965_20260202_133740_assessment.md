## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. government shutdown 2025 google trends pattern (Google)
2. February 2026 government shutdown deadline (Google News)
3. Compare Google Trends spikes for "government shutdown [year]" around funding deadlines, especially early February periods; list day-level scores and duration of post-deadline drop. (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. government shutdown 2026 February deadline (Google)
2. "government shutdown 2026" Feb talks (Google News)
3. What funding deadlines or congressional negotiations could trigger a U.S. federal government shutdown in early February 2026? (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Past shutdown patterns (2018, 2019, 2025) | Feb 2026 specific situation |
| Content type | Google Trends decay patterns, base rates | Legislative timeline, negotiation status |
| Unique contribution | Spike-decay reference class | DHS funding dispute context |

**Analysis:**
- Good query differentiation: historical queries sought base rates for search interest patterns, current queries focused on the specific legislative situation
- Historical research correctly targeted Google Trends behavior around shutdown deadlines
- Agent search acknowledged inability to find day-level Trends data but confirmed qualitative decay pattern
- Current queries successfully surfaced the Jan 31 shutdown start, Feb 2 House return, and Feb 13 DHS deadline
- Gap: Could have explicitly searched for "Google Trends government shutdown decay rate" or similar quantitative studies

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - 43-day shutdown Oct-Nov 2025 established as context
  - Partial shutdown began Jan 31, 2026
  - House returns Feb 2, expected to vote Feb 2-3
  - Senate passed funding package 71-29
  - DHS two-week CR expires Feb 13 (key detail for "Increases" risk)
  - Historical pattern: search interest peaks at deadline, decays rapidly post-resolution
- **Critical information missed:** Specific quantitative Google Trends decay rates
- **Source quality:** High - mainstream news (ABC, CBS, Military.com), policy outlets (CRFB), institutional guidance

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Increases | Doesn't Change | Decreases | Score | Key Strength |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 15% | 20% | 65% | 14/16 | Solid reference class analysis, clear timeline reasoning |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 4% | 19% | 77% | 13/16 | Strong decay pattern analysis, perhaps slightly overconfident |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 22% | 28% | 50% | 14/16 | Balanced approach, higher uncertainty acknowledgment |
| S1-4 | o3 | 30% | 10% | 60% | 13/16 | Explicit base rate calculation (67/33/0), low "Doesn't change" |
| S1-5 | o3 | 25% | 9% | 66% | 13/16 | Good historical analysis with pytrends reference |

**Key observations:**
- All forecasters converged on "Decreases" as modal outcome (50-77%)
- Notable variance in "Increases" (4-30%) reflects genuine uncertainty about negotiation outcomes
- "Doesn't change" variance (9-28%) reflects different interpretations of +/-3 threshold tightness
- S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) was most confident in "Decreases" (77%), S1-4 (o3) was most confident in "Increases" (30%)
- Good reasoning across all forecasters about Google Trends decay patterns

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Increases | Doesn't Change | Decreases | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 10% | 20% | 70% | Yes - increased Decreases confidence based on resolution evidence |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 28% | 4% | 68% | Partially - high "Increases" and low "Doesn't change" unusual |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 12% | 28% | 60% | Yes - modestly adjusted from outside view |
| S2-4 | o3 | 20% | 23% | 57% | Yes - slight shift toward uncertainty, Feb 13 deadline noted |
| S2-5 | o3 | 18% | 15% | 67% | Yes - appropriate adjustment from outside view |

**Distribution Analysis:**
- All forecasters maintained "Decreases" as modal outcome (57-70%)
- F2's distribution is notable: 28% "Increases" is highest in ensemble, while 4% "Doesn't change" is lowest
- F2's reasoning cited post-peak timing and resolution path but assigned higher "Increases" due to "House drama, Feb 13 deadline"
- F3 and F4 gave highest weight to "Doesn't change" (28% and 23%), reflecting the narrow +/-3 threshold
- Consensus: Feb 2 is near peak interest, 10-day window sufficient for decay

### Cross-Pollination Mapping

Per the metadata, this is a multiple_choice question with the standard cross-pollination structure:
- F1 receives F1's outside view (Sonnet 4.5 <- self)
- F2 receives F4's outside view (Sonnet 4.5 <- o3)
- F3 receives F2's outside view (GPT-5.2 <- Sonnet 4.5)
- F4 receives F3's outside view (o3 <- GPT-5.2)
- F5 receives F5's outside view (o3 <- self)

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- All cross-model instances produced valid outputs
- F2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3 outside view) showed most distinctive final distribution, suggesting cross-pollination influenced reasoning
- Despite different model families, strong consensus on "Decreases" as modal outcome
- F4's relatively high outside view "Increases" (30%) was moderated in inside view (20%), showing appropriate calibration
- Cross-pollination appears effective: prevented over-convergence while maintaining reasonable disagreement

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- Resolution compares Google Trends values on Feb 2 vs Feb 12
- +/-3 threshold determines "Doesn't change"
- The 10-day forecast window spans House return through post-resolution period

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified across forecasters:
1. Partial shutdown began Jan 31, 2026 at midnight
2. Previous shutdown was Oct 1 - Nov 12, 2025 (43 days, longest in history)
3. House returns Feb 2, expected to vote Feb 2-3
4. Senate passed funding package 71-29 with bipartisan support
5. DHS two-week CR expires around Feb 13
6. Google Trends for shutdown-related terms typically peaks at deadline, then decays

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

- F5's outside view claimed "pytrends during pre-analysis" provided specific median decay values - this appears to be reasoned inference rather than actual data extraction (minor)
- Some forecasters referenced "Feb 3 reopening" which was expected but not confirmed at forecast time (appropriate given timeline)

### Hallucinations

None detected. All factual claims traceable to research context or reasonable inference.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong consensus on modal outcome** - All 5 forecasters assigned 57-70% to "Decreases"
2. **Sound reasoning about Google Trends patterns** - Correctly identified spike-decay dynamic
3. **Appropriate uncertainty quantification** - Recognized Feb 13 DHS deadline could cause late-window spike
4. **Good research** - Surfaced key timeline facts (Jan 31 start, Feb 2 House return, Feb 13 deadline)
5. **No extraction failures** - All 5 predictions valid and well-formed
6. **Thoughtful calibration** - Forecasters explicitly considered +/-3 threshold implications

### Weaknesses
1. **Notable variance in "Increases" (10-28%)** - F2's high 28% vs F1's 10% reflects significant disagreement
2. **F2's unusual "Doesn't change" at 4%** - Other forecasters ranged 15-28%; F2's reasoning for this was thin
3. **Limited quantitative Google Trends data** - Research acknowledged gap but couldn't close it
4. **Cross-pollination effect unclear** - F2's distinctive distribution may reflect cross-pollination or model idiosyncrasy

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| **B** | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

This is a solid forecast with appropriate reasoning and consensus on the key outcome. The main issues preventing an A grade are: (1) notable variance in the "Increases" probability suggesting incomplete reconciliation of views, and (2) F2's unusually low "Doesn't change" probability that wasn't well justified given the +/-3 threshold concerns raised by other forecasters.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add explicit search for quantitative studies of Google Trends decay rates for political events
- Query for "government shutdown google trends half-life" or similar
- Consider searching for academic papers on search interest decay patterns

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- The +/-3 threshold interpretation varied significantly - prompts could explicitly address narrow threshold implications
- Consider adding a calibration step that flags when one forecaster's distribution differs substantially from others

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F2):** Produced outlier distribution - 28% "Increases" and 4% "Doesn't change" - may need more explicit guidance on threshold effects
- **GPT-5.2 (F3):** Gave highest "Doesn't change" (28%), appropriately reflecting threshold uncertainty
- **o3 (F4, F5):** Good balance between decay pattern confidence and uncertainty acknowledgment
