## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Apple upcoming earnings February 2026 (Google)
2. Analyst outlook AAPL February 2026 (Google News)
3. Summarize AAPL price reaction after its last 20 earnings reports; provide average and distribution of 10-trading-day returns post-report, note any February seasonality, and list major scheduled catalysts before 2026-02-15. (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Apple Q1 2026 earnings results (Google)
2. Apple stock outlook February 2026 (Google News)
3. What is the latest analyst commentary on Apple after its Q1 2026 earnings and how are February 2026 product demand trends expected to affect the stock? (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Earnings calendar, historical post-earnings drift | Q1 2026 results, Feb 2026 outlook |
| Content type | 10-day post-earnings return patterns, February seasonality | Analyst reactions, supply chain concerns |
| Unique contribution | 55-61% historical post-earnings positive rate, 57% February win rate | CEO memory cost warning, muted market reaction |

**Analysis:**
- Good query differentiation: historical focused on post-earnings drift patterns and February seasonality, current on earnings results and analyst reactions
- Historical query appropriately targeted the specific metric (10-day post-earnings returns) though the agent report noted this data was incomplete
- Current queries captured key drivers: strong earnings beat, memory chip concerns, muted market response
- Key insight surfaced: February seasonality (+1.74% average, 57% win rate) provided useful base rate
- Gap: Historical queries could have been more specific about similar post-earnings contexts (large beats)

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Apple Q1 FY2026 results ($143.8B revenue, +16% YoY, $2.84 EPS)
  - February seasonality data (57% win rate, +1.74% average)
  - Post-earnings market reaction (muted, +0.46% despite beat)
  - CEO warning on memory chip costs affecting margins
  - Dividend ex-date Feb 9, payment Feb 12
- **Critical information missed:** Complete 10-day post-earnings return distribution (agent report flagged this gap)
- **Source quality:** High - official earnings releases, reputable financial news (Yahoo Finance, MacRumors, Benzinga)

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Probability | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 46% | 13/16 | Comprehensive February seasonality analysis | Heavy weighting on -1.2% one-day reaction |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 49% | 14/16 | Balanced historical base rate calculation | Moderate overlap with S1-1 reasoning |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 55% | 14/16 | Clear reference class selection methodology | Less detailed source analysis |
| S1-4 | o3 | 58% | 15/16 | Quantitative weighting (60% broad, 40% post-earnings) | Limited consideration of current news |
| S1-5 | o3 | 57% | 14/16 | Clean base rate calculation with adjustments | Brief justification |

**Key observations:**
- Clear model family divergence: Sonnet instances produced 46-49% (bearish), GPT-5.2 at 55% (neutral), o3 instances at 57-58% (bullish)
- Sonnet models weighted immediate post-earnings reaction more heavily
- o3 models adhered more closely to historical base rates without over-adjusting for recent news
- All forecasters correctly identified February seasonality as relevant reference class
- Range of 12 percentage points (46-58%) indicates genuine analytical uncertainty

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Final Prob | Outside View | Shift | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|------------|--------------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 40% | 46% | -6 pts | Yes - CEO margin warning, market weakness |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 50% | 49% | +1 pt | Yes - minimal shift appropriate |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 51% | 55% | -4 pts | Yes - CEO margin warning, muted reaction |
| S2-4 | o3 | 56% | 58% | -2 pts | Yes - small adjustment for macro weakness |
| S2-5 | o3 | 56% | 57% | -1 pt | Yes - minimal shift, status quo bias |

**Distribution Analysis:**
- All forecasters shifted downward or stayed near their outside view (appropriate given negative new evidence)
- F1 (Sonnet 4.5) had largest shift (-6 pts) citing CEO margin warning and Feb 2 market weakness
- F4 and F5 (o3) made smallest adjustments, maintaining higher probabilities
- Final spread: 40% to 56% (16 pts) - wider than ideal but reflects genuine uncertainty
- Aggregated 50.6% is essentially a coin flip, which aligns with the short-term nature of the question

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- Cross-pollination structure maintained diversity across model families
- Despite receiving different outside view inputs, final predictions showed expected model-family clustering:
  - Sonnet instances: 40%, 50% (more pessimistic, weighted recent negative signals heavily)
  - GPT-5.2: 51% (middle ground)
  - o3 instances: 56%, 56% (more optimistic, adhered to historical base rates)
- Cross-pollination did not force artificial convergence - forecasters maintained independent reasoning
- The spread suggests cross-pollination is working to preserve diversity rather than homogenizing outputs

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- Resolution mechanism: Yahoo Finance API close price comparison
- Comparison dates: Feb 2, 2026 close vs. Feb 15, 2026 close
- Trading day interpretation: ~9-10 trading days in window

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified across forecasters:
1. Apple Q1 FY2026 revenue: $143.8B (+16% YoY)
2. EPS: $2.84 (+19% YoY)
3. iPhone revenue: $85.3B (+23%)
4. February seasonality: 57% win rate, +1.74% average
5. Dividend: $0.26 ex-dividend Feb 9, payable Feb 12
6. Post-earnings reaction: muted (+0.46% on Jan 30 despite beat)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

- F1 stated "-1.2% one-day return on Jan 30" citing Agent report, but AskNews articles indicated stock was up 0.46% on Jan 30. This discrepancy may reflect different calculation windows (close-to-close vs intraday).
- Minor: Some forecasters stated Feb 2 is Sunday (correct) but Feb 15 is also a Sunday (correct), yet resolution would use the previous trading day (Feb 14).

### Hallucinations

None detected. All key statistics traced to provided sources.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **All extractions valid** - 5 of 5 forecasters produced valid probability outputs with no extraction failures
2. **Well-reasoned analysis** - Each forecaster provided clear source analysis, reference class selection, and justification for shifts
3. **Appropriate uncertainty** - Final 50.6% reflects genuine uncertainty in short-term stock prediction
4. **Good research foundation** - Historical and current queries captured relevant information
5. **Proper base rate anchoring** - All forecasters anchored to February seasonality or post-earnings drift data

### Weaknesses
1. **Wide forecast spread** - 16 percentage point spread (40-56%) is higher than ideal, suggesting model families interpret evidence differently
2. **Incomplete historical data** - Agent report failed to deliver the requested 10-day post-earnings return distribution
3. **Factual discrepancy** - Disagreement on Jan 30 one-day return (-1.2% vs +0.46%) not fully resolved
4. **Model family clustering** - Sonnet consistently more bearish than o3, suggesting systematic differences in evidence weighting

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| **B** | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

The forecast demonstrates solid methodology with comprehensive source analysis and appropriate uncertainty quantification for a difficult short-term stock prediction. The main deductions are for the wide ensemble spread suggesting model-level disagreement on evidence interpretation, and one minor factual discrepancy. The final aggregated prediction of 50.6% appropriately reflects the inherent difficulty of predicting 9-10 day stock movements.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Include explicit query for current spot price at forecast time to establish clear baseline
- Request complete historical post-earnings return data more directly
- Add query for options market implied volatility as measure of expected movement

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Consider adding calibration guidance to reduce model-family systematic biases
- Enhance outside view prompts to ensure forecasters don't over-weight recent news in base rate calculations

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Tends toward recency bias - weighted immediate post-earnings reaction heavily despite it being a single data point. Consider guidance to maintain base rate anchoring.
- **o3:** Good base rate adherence but inside view adjustments may be too small - could potentially miss important current information.
