**Historical Queries:**
1. Nominal Broad Dollar Index history (Google)
2. Fed DTWEXBGS daily movements 2026 (Google News)
3. Download DTWEXBGS daily series 2025-02 to 2026-02 csv (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index DTWEXBGS 2026 (Google)
2. U.S. broad dollar index February 2026 outlook (Google News)
3. What analysts are saying about the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index ahead of January 2026 CPI release and Fed policy path (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Historical volatility patterns, 2025-2026 trajectory | Current levels, Feb 2026 outlook, Fed policy |

- Gap: Historical Google News query returned no results ("No URLs returned from Google")
- The Agent report provided valuable procedural information but included example values that may have been treated as authoritative
- Current queries successfully surfaced key catalyst: Kevin Warsh nomination as Fed Chair

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current DTWEXBGS level: ~119.29 as of January 2026
  - Kevin Warsh Fed Chair nomination and market reaction
  - MUFG and Goldman Sachs outlooks projecting modest USD decline in 2026
  - Historical volatility characteristics of the series
- **Critical information missed:** No actual FRED data values between Jan 23 and Feb 2; reliance on interpolation
- **Source quality:** High - Trading Economics, MUFG Research, Goldman Sachs, multiple news sources

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Median Est. | 10-90 Range | Score | Key Strength |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~120.0 | 118.7-121.7 | 13/16 | Clear source analysis, appropriate volatility estimate |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~120.25 | 118.95-121.75 | 13/16 | Linear interpolation approach, reasonable bounds |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~120.4 | 118.7-122.5 | 12/16 | Good timeframe analysis, wider right tail |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~119.35 | 118.32-120.39 | 14/16 | Strong reference class analysis, conservative estimate |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~119.7 | 118.5-120.9 | 14/16 | Good volatility calibration, clear methodology |

**Key observations:**
- All forecasters correctly identified the key anchor: DTWEXBGS = 119.2855 on Jan 23, 2026
- O3 models (F4, F5 outside view) produced more conservative, tighter distributions
- Sonnet and GPT-5.2 allowed for more drift from baseline
- All forecasters appropriately identified 8-day volatility characteristics
- The Agent report's example value (121.1457 for Feb 27) was treated differently by forecasters

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Final Median | 10-90 Range | 90% CI Width | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~119.7 | 118.6-121.2 | 2.6 pts | Yes - incorporated Warsh effect |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~119.4 | 118.44-120.36 | 1.9 pts | Yes - conservative adjustment |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~120.0 | 118.7-121.6 | 2.9 pts | Yes - balanced near-term factors |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~120.8 | 118.2-123.2 | 5.0 pts | Questionable - very wide tails |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~119.9 | 118.8-120.9 | 2.1 pts | Yes - modest adjustment |

**Distribution Analysis:**
- Four forecasters (F1, F2, F3, F5) produced reasonable, similar distributions with medians 119.4-120.0
- Agent 4 (o3) is a clear outlier: median 120.8 with 10-90 width of 5.0 points vs ~2.0-2.9 for others
- Agent 4's reasoning cited "DXY +1.7% last week" translating to "+1.5 pts" adjustment - this appears aggressive given the 8-day horizon
- Agent 4's 99th percentile at 126.0 is exceptionally wide for an 8-day forecast
- The final aggregated CDF shows anomalous behavior with percentile 50 mapping to 0.982 cumulative probability

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- Cross-pollination structure: Each forecaster received their own outside view output (no cross-model sharing visible)
- Despite receiving similar historical context, final predictions showed meaningful variance
- Agent 4's divergence suggests cross-pollination did not constrain outlier estimates
- The tight clustering of 4 forecasters (F1, F2, F3, F5) vs one outlier (F4) suggests the ensemble may benefit from trimmed-mean aggregation
- Cross-pollination appears to have created convergence among similar model families (Sonnet instances similar to each other)

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- Resolution source: FRED series DTWEXBGS
- Resolution date: February 10, 2026
- Index baseline: Jan 2006 = 100
- Price range bounds: 101.66 - 147.92

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified across forecasters:
1. Current DTWEXBGS level ~119.3 as of late January 2026
2. Historical range ~86-130 (with Jan 2025 peak at 130.21)
3. Kevin Warsh nomination as Fed Chair creating near-term USD support
4. Typical short-horizon volatility: ~0.6-0.8 index points per week
5. No major Fed meeting or CPI release in the 8-day window (CPI Feb 13)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

1. **Agent report example values**: The Agent report showed "2026-02-27, 121.1457" as an example - forecasters treated this inconsistently (some as authoritative future data, some as illustrative)
2. **DXY vs DTWEXBGS confusion**: Some forecasters applied DXY movements directly to DTWEXBGS without proper adjustment for different baskets
3. **Agent 4 claimed "DXY moved from 95.5 to 97.2"** - this ~1.7% move was translated to ~1.5 index points for DTWEXBGS using a "beta of 0.6" which may overstate the correlation

### Hallucinations

None detected - all forecasters correctly cited available sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Solid question comprehension** - All 5 forecasters correctly identified the target variable and resolution criteria
2. **Good source differentiation** - Forecasters correctly noted that ICE DXY differs from DTWEXBGS
3. **Appropriate volatility calibration** - 4 of 5 forecasters produced reasonable ~2-point 10-90 ranges for 8-day horizon
4. **Relevant catalyst identification** - Warsh nomination correctly identified as key near-term driver
5. **No extraction failures** - All 5 individual CDFs successfully generated

### Weaknesses
1. **Major: Final CDF anomaly** - The aggregated prediction.json shows percentile 50 at 0.982 CDF, suggesting severe aggregation or interpolation error
2. **Agent 4 outlier** - Produced excessively wide distribution (5.0 pt 10-90 range vs ~2.0 average) that may have skewed final result
3. **Inconsistent handling of Agent report data** - The "example" value for Feb 27 was treated as forecast-worthy by some
4. **Limited actual data anchoring** - No forecaster had access to values between Jan 23 and Feb 2

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| **C** | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: D**

**Updated post-resolution:** The peer score of -78.19 confirms this was one of the worst forecasts in the ensemble. The individual forecasters produced reasonable reasoning but critically overconfident distributions. The CDF anomaly (percentile 50 at 0.982 cumulative) reflects the legitimate narrowness of the underlying predictions being mapped onto the wide question range (101.66-147.92), rather than a pure software bug — though the resulting distribution assigned only ~1.5% probability to values below 119, which is where the resolution (117.52) landed. Agent 4's wider distribution, flagged pre-resolution as a problem, was actually the most appropriate. Grade lowered from C to D due to catastrophic overconfidence and the severity of the scoring penalty.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add direct FRED API query to fetch actual recent values rather than relying on interpolation
- Include query for implied volatility from USD options markets
- Clarify Agent report outputs as procedural examples vs actual data

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Critical**: Investigate and fix the CDF aggregation error that produced anomalous final distribution
- Consider trimmed-mean or median aggregation to reduce outlier influence
- Add validation step to ensure final CDF monotonicity and proper probability distribution

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F1, F2):** Good conservative calibration, appropriate for short-horizon forecasts
- **GPT-5.2 (F3):** Solid reasoning, balanced approach
- **o3 (F4):** Produced outlier distribution with excessive width; may need tighter constraints or calibration guidance for short-horizon questions
- **o3 (F5):** Much more reasonable than F4 despite same model; suggests high variance in o3 outputs

### What Happened

The Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index (DTWEXBGS) resolved at **117.52**, a **1.77 point decline** from the last known value of 119.29 (Jan 23). This was a ~1.5% drop in 18 calendar days — a meaningful move but within normal range for the index. For context, this placed the outcome near the **1st percentile** of our submitted distribution, meaning our CDF assigned roughly **1-1.5% probability** to the actual outcome.

### Root Cause Analysis

This forecast failed for **two compounding reasons**: directional error and extreme overconfidence.

#### 1. Directional Error: Missed the Dollar Weakening

All 5 forecasters anchored heavily on the Jan 23 value of 119.29 and predicted modest movement around that level (medians 119.4-120.8). The actual outcome of 117.52 represents a direction and magnitude that no forecaster seriously considered.

**What drove the decline (in hindsight):**
- The research pipeline did **not** surface the Feb 1 tariff announcements (25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico) at all. The word "tariff" appears only twice in the search results — once as background context about 2024-era concerns and once about import costs affecting PPI — but never about the Feb 1 announcement itself. None of the 5 forecasters mentioned tariffs, Canada, or Mexico in their reasoning.
- This is a **research timing failure**: the question was published Feb 2 at 13:06 UTC and the forecast was generated starting at 13:26 UTC — barely 20 minutes after the question opened. The tariff announcement had happened the day before (Feb 1), but the search queries were not designed to catch breaking macro news. The AskNews articles (the most timely source) focused on the Warsh nomination and general dollar weakness trends, missing the tariff story entirely.
- Forecasters correctly identified the Warsh Fed Chair nomination as a near-term catalyst but assessed it as dollar-supportive. The subsequent week's dollar weakness was likely driven by the tariff fallout — retaliatory concerns from Canada/Mexico and broader trade disruption fears — which the broad trade-weighted index is particularly sensitive to (unlike DXY, DTWEXBGS heavily weights trade partners like Canada and Mexico).
- The 8-day window between forecast (Feb 2) and resolution (Feb 10) included the full market digestion of tariff announcements, which proved dollar-negative for the broad trade-weighted index.

**Key miss:** The research pipeline completely failed to surface the most important macro event of the week. This is partially a query design issue (no queries targeted breaking news or recent policy announcements) and partially a timing issue (forecasting within hours of the question opening, before news sources had fully indexed the tariff story).

#### 2. Overconfidence: CDF Far Too Narrow

This is the more damaging error. Even with a directional miss, a properly calibrated distribution would have contained the outcome.

| Percentile | Our Submitted Value | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| p1 (aggregated) | ~117.5 | **117.52** (barely above p1) |
| p5 | ~118.2 | - |
| p10 | ~118.8 | - |
| p50 (median) | ~119.8 | - |

The resolution of 117.52 landed almost exactly at our 1st percentile. For a well-calibrated forecast, ~1% of outcomes should fall at or below p1. But the severity of the scoring penalty (peer score -78.19) indicates this wasn't just bad luck — the distribution was far too concentrated.

**The CDF anomaly identified pre-resolution was real and damaging:** The submitted CDF had ~98.5% of its probability mass above 119.0, with only ~1.6% below that level. For an 8-day forecast of a volatile financial index, the 10-90 range should have been wider. The community's IQR was 3.55 points vs our 1.44 — the community was 2.5x more uncertain, and that wider distribution contained the outcome much better.

**Contributing factors to overconfidence:**
- **Short forecast horizon bias:** Forecasters assumed 8 days meant low volatility, but 8 days is ample time for a 1.5% index move, especially during macro uncertainty.
- **Agent 4 was closest to right:** Ironically, Agent 4 (o3) — flagged as the "outlier" in the pre-resolution assessment — had the widest distribution (p1 at 115.8, 10-90 range of 5.0 points) and was the only forecaster whose distribution meaningfully covered the actual outcome. The aggregation dampened this useful uncertainty.
- **CDF generation compressed tails:** The CDF generation process mapped percentile values that were concentrated in a narrow range (119-121) onto the full question range (101.66-147.92), creating near-zero probability density in the tails. When all forecasters agree on a narrow range, the aggregated CDF becomes extremely peaked.

#### 3. Scoring Impact

| Score | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline score | -27.58 | Much worse than a naive uniform distribution |
| Peer score | -78.19 | Dramatically worse than the community average |
| Spot peer score | -104.98 | Even worse at the snapshot moment |

A peer score of -78 means our forecast was catastrophically worse than other forecasters. The community median was also too high (119.14 vs 117.52) but their wider uncertainty meant the outcome wasn't as far into their tails.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Wider tails on financial indices.** Currency/trade-weighted indices can move 1-2% in a week easily, especially during policy uncertainty. An 8-day 10-90 range of ~2 points on a ~120 index (~1.7%) is too tight. Should be at least 3-4 points.

2. **Don't penalize the widest forecaster.** Agent 4's wider distribution was flagged as an "outlier problem" in the pre-resolution assessment. In reality, it was the best-calibrated forecaster in the ensemble. Consider giving more weight to — or at least not discounting — forecasters with wider uncertainty bands on financial questions.

3. **Research failed to catch the biggest news of the week.** The Feb 1 tariff announcements on Canada and Mexico — the single most important macro event for the broad dollar index — were completely absent from the research pipeline. The search queries focused on general dollar outlook and the Warsh nomination, with no query designed to catch breaking policy news. For financial questions, the research phase needs a "breaking news" query (e.g., "US economic policy announcements last 48 hours").

4. **Tariff/trade policy → broad dollar index is non-obvious.** The broad trade-weighted dollar index can decline when tariffs are imposed, even though the narrow DXY might strengthen. The index composition matters: DTWEXBGS heavily weights trade partners like Canada and Mexico, so tariffs on those countries can weaken the broad index through trade disruption channels, not just safe-haven flows.

5. **CDF generation amplifies narrow consensus.** When all 5 forecasters produce similar narrow distributions, the averaging creates an extremely peaked CDF. The system needs a mechanism to enforce minimum tail width, particularly for financial variables.

6. **Community comparison is informative.** Our IQR was 0.40x the community's — a strong signal of overconfidence. A pre-submission check comparing our distribution width to the community's could flag dangerously narrow forecasts.

### Recommended Pipeline Changes

1. **Add a "breaking news" search query for financial questions.** The current query generation focuses on structural outlook and historical data. For financial indices, add an explicit query like "major US economic policy announcements last 48 hours" or "breaking news USD dollar [current date]" to catch events like tariff announcements.
2. **Minimum tail width for numeric forecasts:** Add a floor on the 10-90 range based on question type. For financial indices, enforce at least 2-3% of the current level.
3. **Community width comparison:** Before submission, compare our IQR to the community's. If ours is <0.5x the community's, flag for review or automatically widen.
4. **Respect outlier uncertainty:** When one forecaster has a much wider distribution, don't just average it away. Consider a "maximum entropy" blend that preserves the widest reasonable tails.
5. **Financial question calibration:** Add domain-specific guidance in prompts for financial indices — historical weekly volatility should set a floor on uncertainty, not a ceiling.
