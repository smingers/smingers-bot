## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Nominal Broad Dollar Index history (Google)
2. Fed DTWEXBGS daily movements 2026 (Google News)
3. Download DTWEXBGS daily series 2025-02 to 2026-02 csv (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index DTWEXBGS 2026 (Google)
2. U.S. broad dollar index February 2026 outlook (Google News)
3. What analysts are saying about the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index ahead of January 2026 CPI release and Fed policy path (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Historical volatility patterns, 2025-2026 trajectory | Current levels, Feb 2026 outlook, Fed policy |
| Content type | Data series mechanics, historical range | Market drivers, Warsh nomination, analyst forecasts |
| Unique contribution | Baseline volatility estimate, procedural data access | Near-term catalysts, directional sentiment |

**Analysis:**
- Good query differentiation: Historical focused on obtaining actual data series and understanding volatility patterns
- Current queries targeted analyst sentiment and near-term drivers (Fed policy, Warsh nomination)
- Gap: Historical Google News query returned no results ("No URLs returned from Google")
- The Agent report provided valuable procedural information but included example values that may have been treated as authoritative
- Current queries successfully surfaced key catalyst: Kevin Warsh nomination as Fed Chair

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current DTWEXBGS level: ~119.29 as of January 2026
  - Kevin Warsh Fed Chair nomination and market reaction
  - MUFG and Goldman Sachs outlooks projecting modest USD decline in 2026
  - Historical volatility characteristics of the series
- **Critical information missed:** No actual FRED data values between Jan 23 and Feb 2; reliance on interpolation
- **Source quality:** High - Trading Economics, MUFG Research, Goldman Sachs, multiple news sources

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Median Est. | 10-90 Range | Score | Key Strength |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~120.0 | 118.7-121.7 | 13/16 | Clear source analysis, appropriate volatility estimate |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~120.25 | 118.95-121.75 | 13/16 | Linear interpolation approach, reasonable bounds |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~120.4 | 118.7-122.5 | 12/16 | Good timeframe analysis, wider right tail |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~119.35 | 118.32-120.39 | 14/16 | Strong reference class analysis, conservative estimate |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~119.7 | 118.5-120.9 | 14/16 | Good volatility calibration, clear methodology |

**Key observations:**
- All forecasters correctly identified the key anchor: DTWEXBGS = 119.2855 on Jan 23, 2026
- O3 models (F4, F5 outside view) produced more conservative, tighter distributions
- Sonnet and GPT-5.2 allowed for more drift from baseline
- All forecasters appropriately identified 8-day volatility characteristics
- The Agent report's example value (121.1457 for Feb 27) was treated differently by forecasters

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Final Median | 10-90 Range | 90% CI Width | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~119.7 | 118.6-121.2 | 2.6 pts | Yes - incorporated Warsh effect |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~119.4 | 118.44-120.36 | 1.9 pts | Yes - conservative adjustment |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~120.0 | 118.7-121.6 | 2.9 pts | Yes - balanced near-term factors |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~120.8 | 118.2-123.2 | 5.0 pts | Questionable - very wide tails |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~119.9 | 118.8-120.9 | 2.1 pts | Yes - modest adjustment |

**Distribution Analysis:**
- Four forecasters (F1, F2, F3, F5) produced reasonable, similar distributions with medians 119.4-120.0
- Agent 4 (o3) is a clear outlier: median 120.8 with 10-90 width of 5.0 points vs ~2.0-2.9 for others
- Agent 4's reasoning cited "DXY +1.7% last week" translating to "+1.5 pts" adjustment - this appears aggressive given the 8-day horizon
- Agent 4's 99th percentile at 126.0 is exceptionally wide for an 8-day forecast
- The final aggregated CDF shows anomalous behavior with percentile 50 mapping to 0.982 cumulative probability

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- Cross-pollination structure: Each forecaster received their own outside view output (no cross-model sharing visible)
- Despite receiving similar historical context, final predictions showed meaningful variance
- Agent 4's divergence suggests cross-pollination did not constrain outlier estimates
- The tight clustering of 4 forecasters (F1, F2, F3, F5) vs one outlier (F4) suggests the ensemble may benefit from trimmed-mean aggregation
- Cross-pollination appears to have created convergence among similar model families (Sonnet instances similar to each other)

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- Resolution source: FRED series DTWEXBGS
- Resolution date: February 10, 2026
- Index baseline: Jan 2006 = 100
- Price range bounds: 101.66 - 147.92

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified across forecasters:
1. Current DTWEXBGS level ~119.3 as of late January 2026
2. Historical range ~86-130 (with Jan 2025 peak at 130.21)
3. Kevin Warsh nomination as Fed Chair creating near-term USD support
4. Typical short-horizon volatility: ~0.6-0.8 index points per week
5. No major Fed meeting or CPI release in the 8-day window (CPI Feb 13)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

1. **Agent report example values**: The Agent report showed "2026-02-27, 121.1457" as an example - forecasters treated this inconsistently (some as authoritative future data, some as illustrative)
2. **DXY vs DTWEXBGS confusion**: Some forecasters applied DXY movements directly to DTWEXBGS without proper adjustment for different baskets
3. **Agent 4 claimed "DXY moved from 95.5 to 97.2"** - this ~1.7% move was translated to ~1.5 index points for DTWEXBGS using a "beta of 0.6" which may overstate the correlation

### Hallucinations

None detected - all forecasters correctly cited available sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Solid question comprehension** - All 5 forecasters correctly identified the target variable and resolution criteria
2. **Good source differentiation** - Forecasters correctly noted that ICE DXY differs from DTWEXBGS
3. **Appropriate volatility calibration** - 4 of 5 forecasters produced reasonable ~2-point 10-90 ranges for 8-day horizon
4. **Relevant catalyst identification** - Warsh nomination correctly identified as key near-term driver
5. **No extraction failures** - All 5 individual CDFs successfully generated

### Weaknesses
1. **Major: Final CDF anomaly** - The aggregated prediction.json shows percentile 50 at 0.982 CDF, suggesting severe aggregation or interpolation error
2. **Agent 4 outlier** - Produced excessively wide distribution (5.0 pt 10-90 range vs ~2.0 average) that may have skewed final result
3. **Inconsistent handling of Agent report data** - The "example" value for Feb 27 was treated as forecast-worthy by some
4. **Limited actual data anchoring** - No forecaster had access to values between Jan 23 and Feb 2

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| **C** | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: C**

The individual forecaster outputs demonstrated sound reasoning and appropriate methodology for an 8-day currency index forecast. However, the final aggregated CDF is clearly malformed, with the median (50th percentile) mapping to a 0.982 cumulative probability rather than the expected 0.50. This suggests a critical error in the CDF generation or interpolation step. Agent 4's outlier distribution (median 120.8, 10-90 range of 5.0 points) is also concerning for such a short forecast horizon.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add direct FRED API query to fetch actual recent values rather than relying on interpolation
- Include query for implied volatility from USD options markets
- Clarify Agent report outputs as procedural examples vs actual data

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Critical**: Investigate and fix the CDF aggregation error that produced anomalous final distribution
- Consider trimmed-mean or median aggregation to reduce outlier influence
- Add validation step to ensure final CDF monotonicity and proper probability distribution

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F1, F2):** Good conservative calibration, appropriate for short-horizon forecasts
- **GPT-5.2 (F3):** Solid reasoning, balanced approach
- **o3 (F4):** Produced outlier distribution with excessive width; may need tighter constraints or calibration guidance for short-horizon questions
- **o3 (F5):** Much more reasonable than F4 despite same model; suggests high variance in o3 outputs
