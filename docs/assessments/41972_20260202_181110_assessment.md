## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| F1 reference class misapplication | Critical | S1-1 | F1 used "6/6 court appearances caused spikes" (measuring pre-event to post-event) but question asks to compare two post-spike decay positions (Feb 2 at day 3 of Jan 30 decay vs Feb 15 at day 9 of Feb 6 decay)—wrong question applied to reference class |
| F1 error propagates to S2-1 | Critical | S2-1 | S2-1 received F1's flawed outside view and maintained 77% Increases, creating a 55pp outlier that distorts aggregation |
| Aggregation obscures flawed outlier | High | Aggregation | Final 35%/18%/47% blends F1's erroneous 77% with F2-5's correct decay thesis—a human reviewer would reject F1's reasoning but the pipeline weighted it equally |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Luigi Mangione Google Trends (Google)
2. Luigi Mangione (Google News)
3. Analyze Google Trends data for Luigi Mangione last 12 months and flag any known events tied to past spikes; list upcoming events Feb 2–15 2026 that could move interest (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Luigi Mangione upcoming 2026 (Google)
2. Luigi Mangione recent news (Google News)
3. Are any events, announcements, legal actions or media releases involving Luigi Mangione expected or newly reported for early to mid-February 2026? (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Dec 2024 - Jan 2026 patterns, 12-month spike analysis | Feb 2026 upcoming catalysts, recent news |
| Content type | Reference class behavior, spike-event correlation | Scheduled events, breaking developments |
| Unique contribution | Documented 6 court-driven spikes with 200-1400% increases | Feb 6 hearing discovery, Jan 30 ruling context |

**Analysis:**
- **Discrete and complementary:** Historical queries appropriately targeted base rate establishment (court-driven spike patterns), while current queries surfaced decision-relevant catalysts (Feb 6 hearing, Jan 30 ruling)
- **Key success:** Research discovered the Feb 6 unexpected court summons (ABC7, Jan 31) - this is the critical catalyst for the forecast
- **Appropriate temporal separation:** Historical research found the Feb 2025 loafer spike (1,400%), Apr 2025 death penalty announcement, Dec 2025 evidentiary hearing; current research captured Jan 30 death penalty dismissal
- **Gap identified:** No direct query for current Google Trends baseline value on Feb 2

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remained appropriately factual. The Agent report provided synthesis and hypothesis generation but did not assign probabilities. Article summaries extracted facts (search spike percentages, dates, rulings) without making predictions.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Feb 6 unexpected state court summons (ABC7, Jan 31)
  - Jan 30 death penalty dismissal ruling (CNN, NBC, BBC)
  - Historical pattern: 6 documented court-driven spikes over 12 months
  - Fashion virality precedent (1,400% loafer searches, Feb 2025)
  - Ongoing fan culture ("mangionistas," $1.3M defense fund)
  - Mark Anderson arrest for impersonation attempt (Jan 29)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Actual Google Trends baseline value for Feb 2
  - Precise magnitude comparison of Jan 30 spike vs prior spikes

- **Source quality:** Excellent - CNN, NBC, BBC, ABC7 (all Tier-1 or reliable affiliates)

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation of 7 sources with explicit quality ratings (Tier-1 vs blog), date relevance assessment, and fact/opinion distinction. Correctly identified NCRI as expert source. Score: 4/4

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 candidates: (1) high-profile criminal defendants, (2) viral folk hero figures, (3) true crime subject decay. Selected "high-profile criminal defendants with ongoing legal proceedings and significant public support/controversy." **Critical flaw:** Applied the wrong question to the reference class. The "6/6 court appearances produced increases" statistic measures whether court events cause spikes *from pre-event baselines*—but the question asks whether Feb 15 (9 days post-spike) will be higher than Feb 2 (3 days post-spike). These are different questions. The reference class is appropriate, but F1 extracted the wrong lesson from it. Score: 2/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 13-day window and identified key dates (Jan 30, Feb 2, Feb 6, Feb 15). However, drew the wrong conclusion from correct temporal structure. F1 concluded Feb 6 spike would make Feb 15 higher than Feb 2, but failed to recognize that Feb 2 is *closer* to the Jan 30 spike than Feb 15 is to the Feb 6 spike. The correct comparison is: Feb 2 sits at day 3 of decay from Jan 30; Feb 15 sits at day 9 of decay from Feb 6. Day 9 of decay is typically lower than day 3 of decay. Score: 3/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear mathematical derivation but based on irrelevant statistic. The "6/6 court appearances produced increases" measures pre-event to post-event change—not cross-spike comparison. F1 essentially answered "will Feb 6 cause a spike?" (yes, 100% reliable) when the question is "will day 9 of Feb 6 decay exceed day 3 of Jan 30 decay?" These require different base rates. The adjustments (+5%, +3%, -5%, -3%, -5%) were applied to a fundamentally misframed calculation. Score: 2/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Assigned probabilities to all 3 options: 79% / 13% / 8%
- Probabilities sum to 100%
- Correlation consideration: correctly noted "Doesn't change" is least likely given narrow ±3 threshold and volatile search interest

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Evaluated same 7 sources plus Agent report. Similar quality assessment to S1-1. Correctly identified ABC7's Feb 6 hearing as critical. Score: 4/4

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes: (1) high-profile criminal defendants, (2) folk hero defendants with followings, (3) Google Trends for individuals 12+ months post-fame. Selected #2 "folk hero defendants" citing unique characteristics (merchandise, fashion influence, defense fund, protests). Reasonable but less analytically rigorous than S1-1. Score: 3/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 13-day window. Key insight: "Feb 2: Elevated baseline from Jan 30 spike (decaying); Feb 6: New spike from court appearance; Feb 15: Likely lower than Feb 2 unless Feb 6 spike is exceptionally large." This is the **opposite conclusion** from S1-1 on the same facts. Score: 4/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear reasoning: "DECREASE is most likely because: (a) Feb 2 has less decay time from Jan 30 than Feb 15 has from Feb 6, (b) historical pattern strongly favors decay, (c) no major events scheduled for Feb 12-15." Final: 20% Increases, 10% Doesn't change, 70% Decreases. **This directly contradicts S1-1's thesis.** Score: 3/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Assigned probabilities to all 3 options: 20% / 10% / 70%
- Probabilities sum to 100%
- Different option ranked most likely than S1-1 (Decreases vs Increases)

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Evaluated sources with quality/date assessment. Correctly categorized Agent report as "hypothesis generator, not hard data." Appropriately skeptical of uncited claims. Score: 4/4

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes: (1) high-profile criminal defendant searches around court milestones, (2) viral internet villain/anti-hero memes, (3) any proper name on Google Trends. Selected #1 with justification: "closest match: same type of driver—court calendar/news coverage." Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 13-day window. Noted: "A new hearing inside the window (Feb 6 per ABC7) can create a countervailing spike. But even then, by Feb 15 the series often drifts downward again." Good analysis of decay vs spike dynamics. Score: 4/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Reasoned: "most likely Decreases, meaningful chance of Increases due to in-window court event, smallest probability on Doesn't change." Final: 26% Increases, 19% Doesn't change, 55% Decreases. Consistent with decay thesis. Score: 3/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Assigned probabilities to all 3 options: 26% / 19% / 55%
- Probabilities sum to 100%
- Aligns with F2's decay thesis, not F1's catalyst thesis

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Brief but systematic. Correctly rated sources (Livemint cites WWD, Agent report is "hypothesis generator"). Appropriate skepticism. Score: 3/4

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes: (i) high-profile defendants with cult followings (Rittenhouse, Blanchard), (ii) celebrity true-crime subjects without imminent hearings, (iii) ordinary mid-tier news topics. Selected #2 "between major hearings" because "Mangione has no formal hearing scheduled 2-15 Feb." **This misses the Feb 6 hearing** mentioned in ABC7. Score: 2/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Provided concrete historical data: "Kyle Rittenhouse (2-16 Aug 2021): 77% of two-week pairs showed 'change'; Adnan Syed: 64%; Holmes: 71%." Derived "Average probability of Δ≥4 points ≈ 70 %. Direction skew: after a late-January news spike, interest falls more often than rises (≈60 % of the time)." Excellent quantitative grounding. Score: 4/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Mathematical derivation: Change 70%, No-change 30%; directional tilt 60% downward. Compute: Decrease = 0.70 × 0.60 ≈ 42%, Increase = 0.70 × 0.40 ≈ 28%, Doesn't change = 30%. Adjustments: +2% Increase for hearing, -2% No-change. Final: 30% / 28% / 42%. Clear methodology. Score: 4/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Assigned probabilities to all 3 options: 30% / 28% / 42%
- Probabilities sum to 100%
- More moderate than F2/F3 but still favors Decreases

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Brief evaluation with quality ratings. Correctly identified CNN/NBC as highly reliable, Agent report as "informed speculation" for forward-looking items. Score: 3/4

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes: (1) high-profile criminal defendants (SBF, Chauvin), (2) true-crime meme figures (Blanchard, Casey Anthony), (3) fashion-viral defendants (Holmes). Selected #1 "search volume demonstrably tethered to legal milestones; fashion virality is secondary." Good reasoning. Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Provided empirical estimates: "after-spike curves still finish lower than t-0 value about 55-60% of time; finish higher ~25%; finish flat (±3) ~15-20%." Correctly identified 6 Feb as potential counter-trend. Score: 4/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Base rates from "n≈40 daily-index episodes": Decrease 58%, Flat 18%, Increase 24%. Adjustments: +3% Increase for Feb 6 hearing and DOJ news, +2% Flat for ±3 band. Final: 27% / 20% / 53%. Well-grounded. Score: 4/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Assigned probabilities to all 3 options: 27% / 20% / 53%
- Probabilities sum to 100%
- Consistent with decay thesis

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Inc/NC/Dec) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|-------------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 79% / 13% / 8% | 11/16 | Comprehensive source analysis | **Applied wrong question to reference class**—used "do court events cause spikes?" (irrelevant) instead of "comparing two post-spike decay positions" (the actual question) |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 20% / 10% / 70% | 14/16 | Good temporal decay analysis, correctly framed comparison | Underweights Feb 6 catalyst potential |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 26% / 19% / 55% | 15/16 | Balanced analysis, appropriate uncertainty | Less specific than S1-4/5 |
| S1-4 | o3 | 30% / 28% / 42% | 13/16 | Excellent quantitative reference class data | **Missed Feb 6 hearing** in reference class selection |
| S1-5 | o3 | 27% / 20% / 53% | 15/16 | Clear empirical base rates | None significant |

**Critical Observation:** S1-1 and S1-2 (both Sonnet 4.5) reached **opposite conclusions** on the same evidence. S1-1: 79% Increases (Feb 6 dominates). S1-2: 70% Decreases (decay dominates). This is a fundamental disagreement, not methodological diversity.

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (Inc/NC/Dec) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 79% / 13% / 8% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 30% / 28% / 42% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 20% / 10% / 70% |

| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 27% / 20% / 53% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent Strong/Moderate/Weak framework application. Strong: Feb 6 appearance confirmed, timing dynamics, 6/6 historical reliability. Moderate: "unexpected" nature, recent Jan 30 ruling. Weak: cryptocurrency token decline. Score: 4/4

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 79/13/8 → Output: 77/15/8. Δ = -2% Increases, +2% Doesn't change. Minimal shift, justified: "current information validates rather than contradicts outside view assumptions." Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "If timeframe halved: would dramatically increase 'Increases' probability to ~90%... If timeframe doubled: would shift toward 'Decreases' (~40-50%)." Clear sensitivity analysis. Score: 4/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with all 6 elements: paraphrase (correct), base rate alignment (stated), consistency check (performed), top evidence (5 items listed), blind spot identified (procedural hearing + anomalous Feb 2 high + deep decay), technicalities (verified). Score: 4/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Updates preserved probability sum = 100% ✓
- Relative probabilities adjusted sensibly (minor shift to NC) ✓
- Identified most affected option: Increases, slightly reduced ✓

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework application. Strong: Jan 30 death penalty ruling (3 days ago), historical decay pattern. Moderate: Feb 6 hearing (could surprise), DOJ appeal decision. Weak: meme coin, fashion incidents. Score: 3/4

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 30/28/42 (from S1-4) → Output: 25/25/50. **But S2-2 states its outside view as 42/30/28** (different order), showing some confusion. The update shifts toward Decreases by +8pp. Justified by "temporal decay is already underway" and "no major catalyst scheduled." Score: 3/4

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses halved/doubled: "If halved (to ~Feb 8): Would increase 'Doesn't change' probability... If doubled (to ~Feb 28): Would strongly increase 'Decreases' probability." Score: 4/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with all elements. Blind spot identified: "Feb 6 hearing reveals major development (plea deal, new charges, sanctions)." Score: 4/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Updates preserved probability sum = 100% ✓
- Adjusted toward Decreases, consistent with evidence interpretation ✓
- **Key disagreement:** Treats Feb 6 as "procedural hearing, likely smaller spike"—opposite of S2-1's "100% historical reliability" interpretation

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear framework. Strong: Jan 30 ruling elevates Feb 2, court events → spikes → decay mechanism. Moderate: Feb 6 appearance, DOJ appeal timing. Weak: meme coin, supporter narratives. Score: 4/4

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 20/10/70 (S1-2's decay thesis) → Output: 26/12/62. Shifts +6pp to Increases, acknowledging Feb 6 catalyst potential. Justified: "modestly increase 'Increases' because the Feb 6 appearance is a concrete, in-window attention catalyst." Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "If halved: Increases becomes more likely (Feb 6 spike closer to endpoint). If doubled: Decreases becomes more likely (DOJ appeal deadline enters window)." Clear. Score: 4/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Identifies blind spot: "major, widely covered surprise on/near Feb 14–15 could flip to Increases." Score: 4/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Updates preserved probability sum = 100% ✓
- Modest update toward Increases, reasonable given Feb 6 ✓
- Maintains Decreases as most likely, consistent with decay thesis

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Systematic evaluation. Strong: Jan 30 spike decaying, historical decay pattern. Moderate: Feb 6 hearing. Weak: crypto prices. Concise but complete. Score: 3/4

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 26/19/55 → Output: 22/20/58. Small shift: -4pp Increases, +1pp NC, +3pp Decreases. Justified by decay underway. Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "Window: 13 days. If halved (6½ days), Feb 6 spike dominates → Increase odds rise. If doubled (~4 weeks), more decay → Decrease climbs." Score: 4/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Abridged but complete. Correctly notes: "Most likely = Decreases, least likely = Doesn't change." Blind spot: "unexpected viral content (e.g., leaked jail video) on 13-14 Feb could lift interest → Increase wins." Score: 3/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Updates preserved probability sum = 100% ✓
- Slight tightening toward Decreases thesis ✓

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear Strong/Moderate/Weak structure. Strong: historical decay pattern, 30 Jan ruling confirmed by multiple outlets. Moderate: Feb 6 appearance, DOJ appeal deadline. Weak: crypto/social chatter. Score: 4/4

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 27/20/53 → Output: 25/20/55. Δ = -2pp Increases, +2pp Decreases. Minimal shift justified: "decay still dominates absent a major unscheduled event." Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "If cut to 7 days I would raise 'Decrease' +5 pts... If doubled to 26 days I would also raise 'Decrease' +8 pts." Clear sensitivity. Score: 4/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete (abridged format). Blind spot: "viral documentary or major celebrity endorsement drops unexpectedly before 15 Feb." Score: 4/4

**Multiple Choice-specific assessment:**
- Updates preserved probability sum = 100% ✓
- Minimal adjustment, consistent with input thesis ✓

- **Score:** 16/16

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-1 (Sonnet receiving S1-1 self-model):** No cross-pollination occurred; received its own model's output. Maintained high-confidence Increases thesis with minimal update (-2pp). Expected behavior.

- **S2-2 (Sonnet receiving S1-4 o3):** **Failed to integrate cross-model input meaningfully.** S1-4 gave 30/28/42 (Decreases 42%), but S2-2 shifted further toward Decreases (50%) rather than considering the more moderate input. The Sonnet instance appears to have its own strong prior (decay thesis) that dominated the o3 input.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2 Sonnet):** Engaged appropriately. S1-2 gave 20/10/70 (strong decay thesis). S2-3 moderated this to 26/12/62, pulling back slightly toward Increases to account for Feb 6 catalyst. Good cross-model integration.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3 GPT-5.2):** Received 26/19/55, output 22/20/58. Minor tightening toward Decreases. Appropriate engagement with input.

- **S2-5 (o3 receiving S1-5 self-model):** No cross-pollination; self-model input. Minimal update (-2pp Increases). Expected.

**Critical finding:** Cross-pollination did **NOT** resolve the fundamental S1-1 vs S1-2 disagreement. Both Sonnet 4.5 instances maintained their original theses:
- S2-1: 77% Increases (catalyst thesis)
- S2-2: 50% Decreases (decay thesis)

**Same model, same evidence, but F1's analysis was flawed.** F1 applied the wrong question to its reference class: using "6/6 court appearances caused spikes" (measuring pre-event to post-event change) when the question requires comparing two post-spike decay positions (day 3 of Jan 30 decay vs day 9 of Feb 6 decay). F2-5's decay thesis correctly framed the comparison. This is not genuine ambiguity in the evidence—F1 made a reference class misapplication error that propagated through S2-1. The cross-pollination structure (S2-2 receiving S1-4 from o3) did not expose S2-2 to S1-1's flawed thesis, so the error was never corrected.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- ✓ Resolution criteria: Google Trends value comparison, ±3 threshold for "Doesn't change"
- ✓ Timeframe: Feb 2 vs Feb 15 (13-day window)
- ✓ Options: Increases (>+3), Doesn't change (±3), Decreases (>-3)
- ✓ Data source: Google Trends US, specific URL provided

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Jan 30, 2026 federal judge dismissed death penalty charge (CNN, NBC, BBC)
2. Feb 6, 2026 unexpected state court summons (ABC7)
3. Federal trial: jury selection Sept 8, opening Oct 13, 2026
4. Historical pattern: court appearances drove search spikes (6 documented instances)
5. Mark Anderson arrest for impersonation attempt (Jan 29)
6. Ongoing fan culture: "mangionistas," defense fund, merchandise

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 (o3) | Factual miss | Selected reference class "between major hearings" stating "no formal hearing scheduled 2-15 Feb" despite ABC7 reporting Feb 6 summons | Medium - led to underweighting Feb 6 |
| S2-1 vs S2-2 | Interpretation split | S2-1: "court appearances have 100% historical reliability"; S2-2: "procedural hearing (lower impact than federal ruling)" | High - core thesis disagreement |
| None | Factual errors | No outright factual errors detected | N/A |

### Hallucinations

None detected. All key facts traceable to provided research sources.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **High-quality research:** Successfully surfaced the critical Feb 6 court hearing and established historical spike patterns with specific data (1,400% loafer searches, 6 documented spikes)

2. **Comprehensive source analysis:** Most outputs systematically evaluated source quality, timeliness, and fact/opinion distinction

3. **Sound methodological framework:** All forecasters applied the outside view → inside view structure with explicit reference classes, base rates, and calibration checklists

4. **Appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment:** All outputs identified blind spots and provided timeframe sensitivity analysis

### Weaknesses

1. **Critical forecaster divergence (55pp spread):** S2-1 predicts 77% Increases while S2-4 predicts 22% Increases. This is not methodological diversity—it's fundamental disagreement about whether Feb 6 hearing will dominate decay dynamics.

2. **Aggregation obscures rather than synthesizes:** The final 35%/18%/47% doesn't represent either coherent thesis. Four forecasters say "Decreases" is most likely (50-62%); one says "Increases" is most likely (77%). A human reviewing this forecast would want to understand this split, not see it averaged away.

3. **Same-model disagreement unexplained:** S1-1 and S1-2 (both Sonnet 4.5) reached opposite conclusions. S2-1 and S2-2 maintained this split. The pipeline provides no mechanism to flag or investigate this.

4. **Cross-pollination design flaw:** S2-2 received input from S1-4 (o3), not from S1-1 (the opposing Sonnet). The structure prevented direct confrontation of the two Sonnet instances' disagreement.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| **D** | **Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues** |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: D**

The massive forecaster divergence (55pp spread on "Increases") represents a fundamental failure of the ensemble to produce a coherent forecast. The final aggregated prediction (35%/18%/47%) doesn't reflect either thesis and would confuse rather than inform a decision-maker. The individual forecaster outputs are well-reasoned within their own frameworks, but the system lacks any mechanism to detect or resolve the fundamental disagreement about Feb 6 hearing significance.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Query current Google Trends baseline directly:** Add a query specifically for the Feb 2 baseline value to enable more precise magnitude comparisons

2. **Explicitly research procedural vs substantive hearings:** When a court date is discovered, query for typical media coverage patterns by hearing type

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **CRITICAL: Add forecaster spread monitoring:** When spread exceeds threshold (e.g., >40pp on any option), flag for human review before aggregation

2. **Require forecasters to engage with opposing theses:** In Step 2, explicitly prompt forecasters to consider and respond to alternative interpretations

3. **Modify cross-pollination structure:** Ensure at least one cross-model pairing exposes forecasters to opposing theses (e.g., have S2-2 receive S1-1 instead of S1-4)

4. **Add confidence-weighted aggregation:** Consider down-weighting outliers or using median instead of mean when spread is extreme

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (F1):** **Made a critical reference class misapplication error.** Used "6/6 court appearances caused spikes" as the base rate, but this statistic measures pre-event to post-event change—not the question being asked. The actual question requires comparing two post-spike decay positions (day 3 of Jan 30 decay vs day 9 of Feb 6 decay). F1 essentially answered "will Feb 6 cause a spike?" when the question was "which decay position is higher?" This error produced the 77% outlier. Score: 11/16.

- **Sonnet 4.5 (F2):** **Correctly framed the question as a decay comparison.** Appropriately identified that Feb 2 (3 days post-Jan 30) is closer to spike peak than Feb 15 (9 days post-Feb 6). The 70% Decreases reflects sound reasoning about relative decay positions. May slightly underweight potential for unusually large Feb 6 spike, but the analytical framework is correct.

- **GPT-5.2 (F3):** Balanced analysis, appropriately uncertain. Good engagement with cross-pollinated input.

- **o3 (F4):** Excellent quantitative grounding with concrete reference class data (Rittenhouse, Syed, Holmes). However, missed the Feb 6 hearing in reference class selection.

- **o3 (F5):** Clear empirical base rates (n≈40 episodes). Appropriate adjustments.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp | **Yes** | 55pp spread on "Increases" (22% to 77%); 54pp on "Decreases" (8% to 62%) |
| Extraction failures | No | All 5 valid extractions |
| Factual errors present | No | Interpretation differences only |
| Hallucinations detected | No | All facts traceable to sources |
| Cross-pollination effective | **No** | Failed to resolve fundamental S1-1 vs S1-2 disagreement |
| Critical info missed in research | No | Feb 6 hearing successfully surfaced |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All derivations mathematically sound |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | **Yes** | F1 (77% Increases) is massive outlier; mean of others is ~24.5% |

Options: [Increases, Doesn't change, Decreases]

Step 1 Outputs (Outside View):
  S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5): 79% / 13% / 8%    ← CATALYST THESIS
  S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5): 20% / 10% / 70%   ← DECAY THESIS
  S1-3 (GPT-5.2):    26% / 19% / 55%   ← Decay thesis
  S1-4 (o3):         30% / 28% / 42%   ← Moderate decay
  S1-5 (o3):         27% / 20% / 53%   ← Decay thesis

Step 2 Outputs (Inside View):
  S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5): 77% / 15% / 8%  (received S1-1) ← OUTLIER
  S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5): 25% / 25% / 50% (received S1-4)
  S2-3 (GPT-5.2):    26% / 12% / 62% (received S1-2)
  S2-4 (o3):         22% / 20% / 58% (received S1-3)
  S2-5 (o3):         25% / 20% / 55% (received S1-5)

Final Aggregated: 35% / 18.4% / 46.6%

THE FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT:
F1 thesis: Feb 6 hearing = major catalyst (historical 100% reliability, mid-window timing optimal)
F2-5 thesis: Feb 6 hearing = procedural, natural decay from Jan 30 dominates

The aggregate doesn't represent either coherent view.
