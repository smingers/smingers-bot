# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Massive forecaster divergence | High | S2-1 vs S2-2/3/4/5 | F1 predicts 77% Increases while F2-5 predict 50-62% Decreases - opposite conclusions on same evidence |
| Feb 6 hearing interpretation | High | S2-1 vs S2-2 | F1 treats Feb 6 court date as major catalyst (historical 200-1400% spikes); F2 treats it as routine procedural matter |

**This forecast has a fundamental disagreement that the aggregation obscures.** Four forecasters predict "Decreases" is most likely (50-62%), while one predicts "Increases" is most likely (77%). The weighted average produces a muddled 35% Increases / 47% Decreases that doesn't reflect either thesis.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Luigi Mangione Google Trends history (Google)
2. Luigi Mangione news December 2025 (Google News)
3. Historical Google Trends patterns for high-profile defendants (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Luigi Mangione upcoming 2026 (Google)
2. Luigi Mangione recent news (Google News)
3. Events, announcements, legal actions for early to mid-February 2026 (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Dec 2024-Jan 2026 patterns | Feb 2026 catalysts |
| Content type | Reference class behavior | Scheduled events |
| Unique contribution | Court appearance spike patterns | Feb 6 hearing discovery |

**Analysis:**
- Research successfully surfaced the critical Feb 6 court hearing (ABC7, Jan 31)
- Historical research established pattern of court-driven interest spikes
- Current research captured Jan 30 death penalty dismissal context
- Gap: No direct query for current Google Trends value baseline

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Feb 6 unexpected state court summons
  - Jan 30 death penalty dismissal (3 days prior)
  - Historical pattern of court appearance spikes
  - Ongoing fan culture ("mangionistas")
- **Critical information missed:** Current Google Trends baseline value
- **Source quality:** High - CNN, NBC, BBC, ABC7

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Increases | Doesn't Change | Decreases | Key Thesis |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 79% | 13% | 8% | Feb 6 hearing = major catalyst per historical pattern |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 30% | 28% | 42% | Natural decay from Jan 30 spike |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~25% | ~15% | ~60% | (inferred) Decay dominant |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~25% | ~20% | ~55% | (inferred) Decay dominant |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~25% | ~20% | ~55% | (inferred) Decay dominant |

**Key divergence identified at Outside View stage:**
- F1 weighted historical court appearance patterns heavily → predicted increases
- F2-5 weighted natural decay from recent Jan 30 spike → predicted decreases

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Final Distribution | Update from S1 | Core Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 77/15/8 | Minimal (-2% Increases) | Feb 6 hearing confirmed; 6/6 historical reliability |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 25/25/50 | Moderate (+8% Decreases) | Feb 6 is "procedural," decay underway |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 26/12/62 | Slight increase Decreases | Decay pattern dominant |
| S2-4 | o3 | 22/20/58 | Minimal | Decay pattern dominant |
| S2-5 | o3 | 25/20/55 | Minimal | Decay pattern dominant |

**The fundamental disagreement:**

**F1's thesis:** "Court appearances have 100% historical reliability as interest drivers in this case... The Feb 6 catalyst is confirmed and falls optimally within the window."

**F2's counter-thesis:** "It's a state court procedural hearing (lower impact than federal ruling)... No stated reason suggests routine matter... we're already 3 days post-spike."

Both forecasters read the same ABC7 report about the Feb 6 hearing but reached opposite conclusions about its significance.

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- Cross-pollination did NOT resolve the fundamental disagreement
- F1 (Sonnet) maintained 77% Increases despite receiving cross-model input
- F2-5 all converged on "Decreases" being most likely (50-62%)
- The model family split (Sonnet F1 vs everyone else) suggests the disagreement may be model-specific rather than evidence-driven

**Concerning pattern:** One Sonnet instance (F1) and one Sonnet instance (F2) reached opposite conclusions, suggesting the split is not purely model-driven but reflects genuine ambiguity in the evidence.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- Resolution criteria (Google Trends comparison, ±3 threshold)
- Timeframe (Feb 2 vs Feb 15)
- Options (Increases, Doesn't change, Decreases)

### Factual Consensus

Facts correctly identified:
1. Jan 30 death penalty dismissal
2. Feb 6 unexpected state court summons (ABC7)
3. Historical pattern of court-driven interest spikes
4. Ongoing fan culture and media coverage

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Issue | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| F1 | Interpretation | Assumed Feb 6 = major catalyst based on historical pattern | High - drove 77% Increases |
| F2-5 | Interpretation | Assumed Feb 6 = routine procedural matter | High - drove 50-62% Decreases |

**Neither interpretation is factually wrong** - the ABC7 report says "unexpected court summons... no stated reason." Both "major catalyst" and "routine procedural" are reasonable inferences.

### Hallucinations

None detected.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. Research successfully surfaced the key Feb 6 catalyst
2. Both dominant theses (F1's catalyst view, F2-5's decay view) are well-reasoned
3. All forecasters understood the question mechanics correctly
4. Calibration checklists were thorough

### Weaknesses
1. **Massive forecaster divergence (55pp spread)** - the ensemble failed to converge
2. **Aggregation obscures rather than synthesizes** - 35%/18%/47% doesn't represent either thesis
3. **No mechanism to resolve fundamental disagreements** - F1's 77% Increases was simply averaged with four ~25% Increases
4. **Model family inconsistency** - two Sonnet instances (F1, F2) reached opposite conclusions

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| **D** | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: D**

The massive forecaster divergence (55pp spread on "Increases") represents a fundamental failure of the ensemble to reach coherent conclusions. Both F1's thesis and F2-5's thesis are internally consistent, but averaging them produces a muddled prediction that doesn't represent either view. The forecast would have been better served by either: (a) flagging the disagreement for human review, or (b) having forecasters engage with each other's arguments.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Query current Google Trends baseline value directly
- Explicitly research significance of state vs federal court appearances

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Critical:** Add mechanism to flag/escalate when forecaster spread exceeds threshold (e.g., >40pp)
- Consider having forecasters explicitly engage with contrary theses
- Weight forecasters who provide stronger evidence for their interpretation

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F1):** Strong historical pattern reasoning but may over-weight catalyst significance
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F2):** More conservative decay thesis, may under-weight catalyst potential
- **GPT-5.2/o3:** Converged on decay thesis without strong independent reasoning

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp | **Yes** | 55pp spread on "Increases" (22% to 77%) |
| Extraction failures | No | All 5 valid |
| Factual errors present | No | Interpretation differences, not factual errors |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | **No** | Failed to resolve fundamental disagreement |
| Critical info missed in research | No | Feb 6 hearing surfaced |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | **Yes** | F1 is massive outlier |
