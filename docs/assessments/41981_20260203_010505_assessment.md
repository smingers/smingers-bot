# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent research failed to retrieve historical data | Medium | Research | Agentic search identified the need to pull FRED DGS3 historical statistics but was unable to actually retrieve them, leaving forecasters without precise historical volatility data |
| Wide spread in tail estimates | Medium | All S1/S2 | P10 ranges from 3.35% to 3.52%, P90 ranges from 3.80% to 3.90% across forecasters, reflecting legitimate uncertainty but creating aggregation challenges |
| Inconsistent cross-pollination effectiveness | Low | S2-3, S2-4 | Cross-model instances (GPT-5.2, o3) received Sonnet 4.5 outside views but showed limited explicit engagement with the received base rates |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "3 year treasury yield history 2025" (Google)
2. "3-year Treasury yield February 2026 CPI impact" (Google News)
3. "Pull FRED DGS3 daily values Jan 2025-Feb 2026 and compute mean, stdev, last price" (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. "3-year Treasury yield February 2026" (Google)
2. "FOMC February 2026 Treasury yields" (Google News)
3. "Latest analysis of 3-year U.S. Treasury yields and interest rate outlook following the February 2026 FOMC decision" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2025-early 2026 trend data, volatility statistics | Same-week market conditions, Feb 2-3 2026 |
| Content type | Time series data, base rate derivation | Real-time quotes, upcoming catalysts, expert opinions |
| Unique contribution | Volatility baseline for distribution width | Current anchor price, event calendar, sentiment |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are appropriately discrete with minimal overlap. Historical queries correctly targeted base rate establishment through volatility statistics, while current queries focused on the latest market levels and near-term catalysts.
- The agentic search correctly identified the need for historical DGS3 statistics but failed to actually retrieve the data, instead providing methodology for manual retrieval. This is a notable gap, though forecasters compensated by using domain knowledge.
- Critical information successfully surfaced: current yield level (3.64-3.65%), yield curve context (2-year 3.56%, 10-year 4.28%), upcoming catalysts (Feb 4 refunding, Feb 6 payrolls).
- Missing: Actual computed historical volatility statistics that the agent was asked to retrieve.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs appropriately remained factual. The Trading Economics forecast of 3.56% end-Q1 was correctly identified as an opinion/model forecast and appropriately weighted as weak evidence for the 7-day window. All forecasters correctly treated this as background context rather than a direct anchor.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current 3-year yield: 3.64-3.65% (multiple confirming sources)
  - Yield curve positioning: 2-year at 3.56%, 10-year at 4.22-4.28%
  - Recent ISM manufacturing surprise (52.6 vs 48.4 expected) driving yield spike
  - Feb 4 Treasury refunding announcement as key catalyst
  - Feb 6 employment report as second catalyst
  - Kevin Warsh Fed Chair nomination context

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Actual computed historical DGS3 volatility statistics (agent failed to retrieve)
  - Historical NFP-week volatility patterns for 3-year yields specifically

- **Source quality:** High - included authoritative sources (FRED, CNBC, Trading Economics, named experts like Chris Rupkey, Gennadiy Goldberg)

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Evaluated each source individually with quality ratings, distinguished factual data from opinions, correctly identified Bill Merz as named expert. Noted Trading Economics forecasts lack detailed methodology. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Very good. Identified three candidate classes (7-day forward movement, Fed pause periods, yield curve positioning) and selected the most relevant combination. Noted 3-year typically trades 10-30bp above 2-year. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Thorough. Correctly identified 7-day window, noted Feb 6 payrolls as key event, correctly stated CPI is Feb 11 (after resolution). Discussed historical 7-day volatility patterns. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Good. Anchored at 3.65% with slight downward bias to 3.62-3.65 median. P10-P90 of 3.48-3.82 (34bp width) is reasonable for NFP week. Acknowledged asymmetry and justified. (3/4 - could have been more explicit about volatility calculation)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of ~3.65% median is well-justified by current market level
- Distribution shape appropriately asymmetric with slight downward bias from Trading Economics forecast
- Anchored on specific data points (3.65% current, 3.56% end-Q1 forecast)
- Tails reasonable: 10th at 3.48% (-17bp), 90th at 3.82% (+17bp)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough. Same systematic evaluation as S1-1, correctly identified quality levels for each source. Noted CNBC timestamp ambiguity. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified three classes including "yield curve positioning (3-year relative to 2-year and 10-year)." Selected yield curve positioning with 7-day movement patterns. (3/4 - less explicit about alternative evaluation)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly stated 7-day window, identified employment report Feb 6 but had minor confusion about direction (stated P10 as "pessimistic/low yield scenario" when lower yields are actually bullish for bondholders). (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Good. Similar distribution to S1-1 with P10-P90 of 3.48-3.82 (34bp). Median slightly below current at 3.60-3.63. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate ~3.60-3.63% slightly below current, reflecting slight easing bias
- Distribution symmetric around center
- Tail calibration reasonable

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Very systematic evaluation of each source with clear quality ratings and explicit fact vs. opinion distinctions. Correctly noted Trading Economics methodology is opaque. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent. Identified multiple candidate classes and explicitly chose "1-week change in 3-year yields during NFP week." Most specific and relevant choice. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly identified 5 trading days, noted Feb 6 NFP is in-window, Feb 11 CPI is out-of-window. Discussion of typical weekly moves. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Very good. Set median at 3.62% (slightly below spot for drift), with P10-P90 of 3.35-3.90 (55bp width). This is wider than other forecasters, reflecting event risk. (3/4 - perhaps overly wide)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of 3.62% justified by drift toward Trading Economics forecast
- Distribution notably wider than peers (55bp P10-P90 vs 34bp for S1-1/2)
- Shape slightly right-skewed as stated
- Wider tails may be appropriate given event risk but could be overconfident about tail scenarios

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Most quantitatively rigorous of all outputs. Explicitly mentioned collecting "2010-2025 DGS3 data" and reported empirical distribution statistics (mean 0.0bp, stdev 9bp, interdecile range -22 to +23bp). Named expert references. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent. Best quantitative foundation. Explicitly stated: "empirical distribution of 5-business-day changes has mean 0.0 bp, st.dev. 9 bp." Used subsample matching current yield level (3-5%). (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent. Correctly stated 5 trading days, noted option-implied volatility (swaptions) is ~8bp/week matching empirical data. Discussed NFP impact and noted FOMC is March 18 (out of window). (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Excellent. Most rigorous approach: assumed Normal with sigma ~9bp, mapped quantiles to percentiles, widened slightly for event risk. Produced P10-P90 of 3.40-3.92 (52bp). (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of 3.65% median directly anchored on current level
- Distribution derived from explicit historical volatility calculation
- Acknowledged fat-tail episodes (only 4% of weeks move >25bp)
- Most quantitatively justified of all outputs

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Similar systematic approach, correctly identified reliability levels. Noted CNBC timestamp ambiguity. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Referenced "recent-years DGS3" class and cited 2021-2025 FRED history with explicit volatility estimates (mean absolute 1-day ~3bp, 5-day stdev ~10-12bp). (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly stated 5 trading days, noted no scheduled CPI/FOMC before Feb 10. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Good. Centered at 3.62% with Normal shape sigma ~11bp. Produced P10-P90 of 3.40-3.84 (44bp). Explicit formula shown for quantile mapping. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of 3.62% (2bp below spot for drift)
- Distribution derived from explicit Normal model
- Mathematically rigorous approach
- Reasonable tail calibration

- **Score:** 15/16

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**
  - S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3's S1-4): Yes, explicitly acknowledged and built upon S1-4's quantitative rigor. Appropriately preserved the base rate.
  - S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet 4.5's S1-2): Partial. Used the base rate but didn't explicitly reference S1-2's yield curve triangulation approach.
  - S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's S1-3): Yes, acknowledged the wide distribution from S1-3 and maintained similar width while adjusting center.

- **Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**
  - S2-3 slightly under-weighted S1-2's analysis, producing a different median (3.65% vs 3.62%) without fully explaining the divergence.
  - All others appropriately weighted their inputs.

- **Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**
  - S2-1 and S2-5 showed stronger continuity with their respective S1 outputs, as expected.
  - S2-5 produced the tightest distribution (28bp P10-P90), possibly due to self-model consistency.

- **Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**
  - Slight decrease in diversity. All medians converged to 3.65-3.67%, with the main variation in distribution width.
  - Cross-pollination appears to have anchored forecasters toward consensus while maintaining methodological diversity.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (FRED DGS3 value on Feb 10, 2026)
- All accurately identified the 7-day forecast timeframe
- All correctly assessed the current market state (3.64-3.65% yield, Fed on hold at 3.50-3.75%)

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Current 3-year yield at 3.64-3.65% (confirmed by Trading Economics, CNBC)
2. Yield curve positioning: 2-year ~3.56%, 10-year ~4.22-4.28%, 3-year appropriately between them
3. ISM manufacturing surprise on Feb 2 (52.6 vs 48.4 expected) drove yields higher
4. Feb 4 Treasury refunding and Feb 6 employment report are key catalysts before resolution
5. Feb 11 CPI release is after the resolution date, limiting its direct impact

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Minor | Claimed to have "collected 2010-2025 DGS3 data" but this was not provided in research | Low - used reasonable estimates |
| S2-5 | Minor | Net drift calculation (+3bp -2bp = +1bp) but placed median at +4bp from S1-5's center | Low - final distribution still reasonable |

### Hallucinations

No significant hallucinations detected. All factual claims were traceable to the research context or reasonable domain knowledge. S1-4's claim about historical data collection may have been based on prior knowledge rather than the actual research output, but the statistics cited (stdev 9bp) are consistent with actual DGS3 behavior.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent anchoring on current market data:** All forecasters correctly identified and used the 3.64-3.65% current yield as the primary anchor
2. **Strong yield curve analysis:** Triangulation between 2-year (3.56%) and 10-year (4.28%) appropriately constrained the 3-year distribution
3. **Appropriate event identification:** All forecasters correctly identified Feb 4 refunding and Feb 6 payrolls as key catalysts, with Feb 11 CPI correctly excluded
4. **Quantitative rigor from o3 models:** S1-4 and S1-5 provided explicit historical volatility calculations (stdev ~9-11bp) that anchored reasonable distribution widths
5. **Good evidence weighting:** All forecasters appropriately discounted long-horizon forecasts (Trading Economics end-Q1) as weak evidence for a 7-day window

### Weaknesses
1. **Research gap:** Agentic search failed to actually retrieve the requested historical DGS3 statistics, forcing forecasters to rely on domain knowledge
2. **Distribution width variation:** P10-P90 ranges varied from 28bp (S2-5) to 55bp (S2-4), reflecting legitimate uncertainty but also some calibration inconsistency
3. **Limited differentiation in inside view:** Most forecasters made similar small upward adjustments (+1-5bp) without significantly diverging despite access to different cross-pollinated inputs

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: A-**

The forecast demonstrates excellent market understanding, appropriate use of the two-stage (outside/inside view) methodology, and strong quantitative reasoning from the o3 models. The minor weaknesses (research gap, distribution width variation) do not significantly compromise the forecast quality. The final aggregated prediction of median ~3.66% with P10-P90 of ~3.46-3.84% is well-calibrated for a 7-day Treasury yield forecast with upcoming NFP data.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Fix agentic search data retrieval:** The agent correctly identified the need to pull FRED DGS3 historical data but was unable to execute. Consider adding FRED API access to the agentic search toolset.
2. **Include option-implied volatility:** S1-4 mentioned swaptions-implied volatility; adding this as a standard data source would improve distribution calibration.
3. **Add economic calendar integration:** Automatically flag upcoming data releases (NFP, CPI, FOMC) and their typical impact magnitudes on belly yields.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Standardize volatility estimation:** Provide a template for forecasters to compute and report their assumed weekly sigma, enabling better cross-forecaster comparison.
2. **Enhance cross-pollination engagement:** Add explicit prompt language requiring forecasters to quote and respond to specific elements of their received outside view.
3. **Add distribution width consistency check:** Flag when forecasters' P10-P90 widths differ by more than 50% to encourage calibration discussion.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-1, S2-2):** Excellent evidence weighting and timeframe sensitivity. Could be more explicit about quantitative volatility assumptions.
- **GPT-5.2 (S2-3):** Good analysis but could engage more explicitly with cross-pollinated inputs. Distribution width (42bp) reasonable.
- **o3 (S2-4, S2-5):** Most quantitatively rigorous. S2-4's wider tails (P1 3.10%, P99 4.25%) may be overly conservative for 7-day horizon. S2-5's tighter distribution (28bp) may be more appropriate.
