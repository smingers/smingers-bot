# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Irrelevant AskNews results | Medium | Research | AskNews returned mostly cryptocurrency, housing, and international market articles with no relevance to ServiceNow (NOW) stock |
| Inconsistent base rate derivation | Low | S1-1 to S1-5 | Forecasters derived base rates ranging from 52% to 58% for the same reference class (short-term stock movements), showing methodological inconsistency |
| Wide spread in final predictions | Low | Aggregation | 15 percentage point spread (50%-65%) across forecasters for a question with thin signal-to-noise ratio |

**Note:** The methodological diversity and different analytical approaches (e.g., different weighting of Goldman Sachs upgrade vs. negative momentum) are appropriate given the inherent uncertainty in short-term stock prediction. The spread reflects genuine disagreement about how to weight competing factors.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "ServiceNow earnings date Q4 2025" (Google)
2. "ServiceNow stock outlook February 2026" (Google News)
3. Agent query for daily close prices Nov 2025-Feb 2026, scheduled events Feb 3-12, and analyst sentiment since Jan 2026

**Current Queries:**
1. "ServiceNow stock forecast 2026 February" (Google)
2. "ServiceNow earnings January 2026 results" (Google News)
3. "Post-earnings analyst commentary and price-target changes on ServiceNow issued between Feb 1 and Feb 3 2026" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Q4 2025 earnings, price history Nov-Feb | Post-earnings reaction, Feb 2026 outlook |
| Content type | Earnings data, price series, scheduled events | Analyst sentiment shifts, recent price action |
| Unique contribution | Base rate establishment via price history | Goldman Sachs Conviction List addition (Feb 2) |

**Analysis:**
- Queries were reasonably discrete with historical focused on establishing baseline data and current focused on recent catalysts
- Historical queries successfully surfaced Q4 2025 earnings results ($3.47B subscription revenue, +21% YoY)
- Current queries captured the key near-term catalyst: Goldman Sachs adding NOW to Conviction List on Feb 2
- The Agent query was comprehensive and returned valuable data on scheduled events (none in window) and analyst consensus

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs remained appropriately factual. The Agent report correctly stated "broker community remains overwhelmingly constructive" without providing probability estimates. Article summaries reported analyst price targets ($200 median, $260 high) as 12-month views without converting to short-term predictions.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Q4 2025 earnings beat (21% subscription revenue growth)
  - $5B buyback authorization with $2B accelerated share repurchase
  - Goldman Sachs Conviction List addition (Feb 2)
  - No scheduled events in forecast window
  - Stock down 48% over past year, trading near 52-week lows

- **Critical information missed:**
  - None identified - research was comprehensive for a short-term stock question

- **Source quality:**
  - High quality: Fortune earnings article, Q4 earnings call transcript, Globe and Mail Goldman upgrade article
  - Medium quality: Motley Fool analyst aggregation, TickerNerd consensus data
  - Low quality: AskNews results were largely irrelevant (crypto, housing, international markets)

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation of all sources including Yahoo Finance earnings call, Motley Fool, Agent report. Correctly identified CEO promotional statements as "should be heavily discounted." Distinguished factual financial metrics from opinion. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three reference classes (NOW 9-day movements, tech stocks post-earnings, stocks after earnings beats). Selected "ServiceNow 9-day price movements in post-earnings periods without immediate catalysts." Good justification but could have been more precise about historical base rates. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 9 trading days. Identified post-earnings drift period. Discussed technical considerations (28x forward P/E, analyst targets). Acknowledged high volatility context. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 50% baseline, made adjustments for multiple factors (+5-10% earnings, +3-5% analyst sentiment, etc.). Final derivation to 58% was reasonable but adjustments felt somewhat arbitrary. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 58% probability with clear reasoning
- Considered both Yes (earnings beat, analyst support) and No (48% prior decline, no catalyst) pathways
- Update magnitude (+8% from baseline) is justified by post-earnings drift literature

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation including quality ratings for each source. Correctly identified Nasdaq page as corrupted. Distinguished management opinions from verifiable facts. Noted T-Mobile article as irrelevant. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified four classes (short-term stock movements, ServiceNow history, post-earnings drift, stocks in downtrends). Selected "short-term stock price movements for large-cap tech stocks, adjusted for recent earnings beat and downtrend context." (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 7 trading days. Identified random walk baseline. Noted post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) literature. Discussed high volatility increasing uncertainty. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 50-52% baseline. Applied modest adjustments (+2% PEAD, +1% buyback, -1.5% downtrend). Final 52% is well-justified and appropriately conservative. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 52% probability - the most conservative outside view
- Correctly recognized that 7 days is "extremely short, making this essentially a coin flip with minor adjustments"
- Appropriately cautious about overconfidence

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (gpt-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient evaluation noting corrupted Nasdaq page, management framing in earnings call, and promotional tone in Motley Fool. Key takeaway correctly identified as "no scheduled catalyst in the window." (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three classes (all U.S. equities, large-cap tech/SaaS, post-earnings windows). Selected large-cap tech/software over ~7 trading days. Good reasoning. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 9 calendar days (~7 trading sessions). Noted equity risk premium creates slight upward bias. Correctly stated "With no scheduled company-specific events in the window... the distribution is more 'random-walk-with-drift.'" (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchored at 52-53% from generic base rate. Small upward nudge for positive earnings narrative. Final 54% is well-calibrated. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 54% probability with clean logic
- Correctly kept probability near 50% given no-catalyst environment
- Appropriate skepticism about short-horizon directional prediction

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but complete evaluation. Correctly noted T-Mobile article as irrelevant. Identified that analyst sentiment is "already incorporated in the current price." (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three classes (S&P 500 stocks, large-cap cloud/SaaS peers, ServiceNow itself). Selected NOW's own 7-day returns 2013-2025 as "narrowest, most directly applicable." Excellent choice. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 7 trading days. Cited empirical statistics: mean 7-day return +1.0%, std dev 7.0%, positive frequency 56-58%. Excellent quantitative grounding. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 57% historical base rate. Applied -1% no catalyst, -2% negative momentum, +1% market tone. Final 55% is well-derived from actual data. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 55% probability with strongest empirical grounding
- Referenced actual NOW historical 7-day statistics (56-58% positive)
- Best quantitative approach among all forecasters

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Appropriately brief evaluation focusing on data quality. Correctly noted price series from Agent report is "only strictly factual element that feeds directly into a statistical base rate." (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same three classes as S1-4 (all U.S. equities, large-cap tech, NOW itself). Selected NOW's own 7-day returns. Cited specific CRSP data: 54% positive (1,415/2,623 windows). Excellent. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 7 trading days. Noted "drift is small relative to volatility" which is the key insight for short-term prediction. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchored at 54% from historical data. Applied -1% momentum adjustment. Final 53% is appropriately grounded in empirical evidence. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 53% probability with clear empirical basis
- Used CRSP data citation (2,623 windows) - most rigorous among all forecasters
- Correctly recognized that without catalyst, "price dynamics default to random walk with slight upward tilt"

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 58% | 14/16 | Comprehensive source analysis | Adjustment factors feel arbitrary |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 52% | 14/16 | Appropriately conservative | Could cite more historical data |
| S1-3 | gpt-5.2 | 54% | 14/16 | Clean, efficient reasoning | Less empirical grounding |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5) | 58% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 55% |
| S2-3 | gpt-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 52% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (gpt-5.2) | 54% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3) | 53% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Correctly identified Goldman Sachs Conviction List as strong evidence. Appropriately weighted Q4 earnings beat, analyst reiterations, and buyback program. Noted AskNews articles were largely irrelevant. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 58% -> Output: 65%, Delta = +7%. Update justified by Goldman catalyst (Feb 2), optimal timing within post-earnings drift window, and fresh analyst support. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addressed: "If timeframe halved (4-5 days): Probability would increase to ~62-65%... If timeframe doubled (18 days): Probability would decrease to ~53-55%." Excellent analysis. (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed meaningfully. Identified blind spot as "macro market selloff or sector rotation." (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (+7%) matches evidence direction (positive Goldman catalyst)
- Final 65% is internally consistent with stated reasoning about "three independent positive factors"
- May be slightly overconfident given 7-day noise

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong framework. Identified "negative earnings reaction paradox" (stock fell 4% after beat) as key negative signal. Weighted Goldman upgrade positively but noted it's offset by KeyBanc underweight. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 55% -> Output: 50%, Delta = -5%. Update justified by negative post-earnings drift and 40% prior decline creating "structural selling pressure." Contrarian but reasoned. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed: "If timeframe was halved (3-4 days): Would increase probability... If timeframe was doubled (14 days): Would decrease certainty in either direction." (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed. Correctly identified blind spot as "broader tech/software sector rallies strongly." (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (-5%) reflects contrarian interpretation of evidence
- Final 50% is internally consistent with "highly uncertain, balanced scenario"
- Provides useful diversity in ensemble - only forecaster to adjust downward

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (gpt-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Correct application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Goldman Conviction List and ASR rated moderate. Technical weakness (below 200-day SMA) rated moderate-negative. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 52% -> Output: 53%, Delta = +1%. Minimal update: "+1.0 pp: Goldman Conviction List... +0.5 pp: ASR/buyback... -1.0 pp: Stock is near lows." Net +0.5 pp, rounded to 53%. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed sensitivity to halved/doubled timeframe. Noted "if timeframe were halved (~3-4 sessions), I'd move closer to ~51-52%." (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed. Key evidence listed. Blind spot identified as "macro risk-off move." (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (+1%) is minimal and appropriately cautious
- Final 53% reflects "coin-flip" nature of short-term stock prediction
- Most conservative inside view adjustment

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but effective. Negative post-earnings drift (-4%) weighted as moderate evidence for No. Goldman upgrade and buyback weighted as moderate for Yes. Net assessment: factors "roughly cancel." (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 54% -> Output: 52%, Delta = -2%. Adjustments: "-4 ppt for negative post-earnings drift and bearish momentum... +2 ppt for buyback support." Net -2 ppt. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but addressed: "Halving the window would put even more weight on current momentum (slightly lower Yes%)." (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed efficiently. Key evidence: post-earnings negative drift, sub-200-day SMA, $2B ASR, Goldman upgrade. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (-2%) reflects emphasis on negative momentum
- Final 52% consistent with "coin-flip; short horizon and no catalyst justify staying near 50%"
- Appropriately skeptical

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured with explicit Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Strong: Q4 beat + guidance + $5B buyback, Goldman Conviction List. Moderate: analyst consensus, oversold conditions. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 53% -> Output: 55%, Delta = +2%. Adjustments: "+2 pp Q4 earnings beat... +1 pp ASR... +1 pp Goldman upgrade... -3 pp ongoing negative sector sentiment." Net +1 pp, final 55%. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addressed: "If horizon were halved (3-4 days) I would trim probability 1-2 pp toward 50%. If doubled (14 days) I would widen to 57-58%." (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed. Blind spot: "Unexpected macro shock or further SaaS rerating." Status quo correctly noted as "near 50%." (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (+2%) reflects modest positive lean from catalysts
- Final 55% internally consistent with stated reasoning
- Well-calibrated - acknowledges 45% downside probability

- **Score:** 16/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 58% | 65% | +7% | 15/16 | Yes - Goldman catalyst |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 55% | 50% | -5% | 14/16 | Partial - contrarian view on post-earnings reaction |
| S2-3 | gpt-5.2 | 52% | 53% | +1% | 14/16 | Yes - minimal update appropriate |
| S2-4 | o3 | 54% | 52% | -2% | 12/16 | Yes - momentum emphasis |
| S2-5 | o3 | 53% | 55% | +2% | 16/16 | Yes - balanced catalyst assessment |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**

  S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's 55%) engaged strongly, producing the most contrarian view (50%) by emphasizing the negative post-earnings reaction that the outside view didn't weigh heavily. S2-3 (gpt-5.2 receiving Sonnet's 52%) made minimal adjustment (+1%), treating the outside view as appropriately calibrated. S2-4 (o3 receiving gpt-5.2's 54%) adjusted downward (-2%), adding independent emphasis on negative momentum.

- **Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**

  S2-2 may have over-weighted the contrarian interpretation, moving from 55% to 50% primarily based on the "paradox" of negative price reaction to positive earnings. However, this is a legitimate analytical interpretation rather than an error.

- **Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**

  S2-1 (Sonnet receiving Sonnet's 58%) made the largest upward adjustment (+7%), possibly due to model affinity with the reasoning style. S2-5 (o3 receiving o3's 53%) made a modest +2% adjustment, showing more restraint. Same-model pairs showed less dramatic adjustments on average than cross-model pairs.

- **Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**

  Increased diversity. Final spread of 15pp (50%-65%) is larger than outside view spread of 6pp (52%-58%). S2-2's contrarian interpretation (cross-pollinated from o3 to Sonnet) was the primary driver of increased diversity.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (Feb 12 close > Feb 3 close, via Yahoo Finance)
- All correctly identified the 7 trading day / 9 calendar day timeframe
- All correctly assessed the current status: stock down ~48% YoY, just reported strong Q4 earnings, no scheduled catalysts in window

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Q4 2025 subscription revenue: $3.466-3.47B, +21% YoY (beat estimates)
2. $5B buyback authorization with $2B accelerated share repurchase
3. Goldman Sachs added NOW to Conviction List on Feb 2, 2026
4. Stock down ~48% over past year / ~23% YTD
5. No scheduled corporate events between Feb 3-12

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-2 | Minor ambiguity | Cited "40% decline over past year" while others cited "48%" | Low - both from sources |
| None | - | All key facts were accurately reported | - |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All cited facts (earnings figures, Goldman upgrade, analyst consensus, stock decline) were traceable to research sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Appropriate epistemic humility**: All forecasters recognized that 7-day stock movements are largely noise-driven and kept predictions near 50%
2. **Strong empirical grounding**: o3 forecasters (S1-4, S1-5) cited specific historical statistics (54% positive 7-day returns, CRSP data with 2,623 windows)
3. **Comprehensive research**: Successfully surfaced the key near-term catalyst (Goldman Conviction List) and correctly identified absence of scheduled events
4. **Good calibration checklist execution**: All forecasters completed checklists with meaningful blind spot identification

### Weaknesses
1. **AskNews quality**: Current news search returned mostly irrelevant results (crypto, housing, international markets) - wasted tokens
2. **Modest spread inflation**: Final spread (15pp) is wider than outside view spread (6pp), driven primarily by S2-2's contrarian interpretation
3. **Limited historical price data usage**: Despite Agent report providing price series, forecasters didn't calculate actual recent volatility or return statistics

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The forecast demonstrates sound methodology appropriate for a short-term stock prediction question. All forecasters correctly recognized the high noise-to-signal ratio and anchored predictions near 50%. The Goldman Sachs catalyst was appropriately identified and weighted. The diversity in final predictions (50%-65%) reflects genuine analytical disagreement about how to weight competing factors (positive catalyst vs. negative momentum) rather than methodological failures. The final aggregated prediction of 55% is reasonable for a question with limited predictive information.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **AskNews query refinement**: The query "Post-earnings analyst commentary and price-target changes on ServiceNow issued between Feb 1 and Feb 3 2026" was too specific. Broader queries or direct company name searches might yield better results.
2. **Historical volatility calculation**: Have Agent explicitly calculate recent daily volatility and compare to historical norms.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Add explicit random walk baseline**: For short-term stock questions, prompt could include "Note: Academic research shows that for liquid large-cap stocks, the probability of positive return over 7 trading days is approximately 52-54% absent material news."
2. **Timeframe sensitivity template**: Consider adding explicit timeframe sensitivity requirement to inside view prompt.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-1)**: Excellent analysis but +7% update may be aggressive for 7-day horizon
- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-2)**: Valuable contrarian perspective, but update direction (-5%) based primarily on post-earnings reaction may overweight single data point
- **gpt-5.2 (S2-3)**: Appropriately minimal adjustments for low-signal environment
- **o3 (S2-4, S2-5)**: Best empirical grounding; consider including CRSP-style citation in other forecaster prompts
