# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Contradictory interpretation of Q3-25 earnings reaction | Medium | S1-1 vs S1-2 | S1-1 describes Q3-25 as "-1.3%" decline while S1-2 correctly notes a 7.5% drop. The same data point is used differently across forecasters. |
| AskNews returned wrong tickers | Low | Research | Multiple AskNews articles were about VRNS (Varonis), VRSSF (Verses AI), and VRME (VerifyMe) - not VRSN. Forecasters correctly filtered these but research quality suffered. |
| Inconsistent earnings reaction data | Medium | S1-1, S1-2, S1-4 | Different forecasters cite different Q3-25 price reactions: -1.3% (S1-1), -7.5% (S1-2), "down >1%" (Barchart source). This discrepancy was not resolved. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## Summary

- **Question ID:** 41985
- **Question Title:** Will VRSN's market close price on 2026-02-11 be higher than its market close price on 2026-02-03?
- **Question Type:** binary
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-02-03
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-02-11
- **Forecast Window:** 6 trading days (8 calendar days)
- **Final Prediction:** 55.2%
- **Step 2 Predictions:** S2-1: 45%, S2-2: 59%, S2-3: 57%, S2-4: 57%, S2-5: 58%
- **Spread:** 14 percentage points (45%-59%)
- **Total Cost:** $0.79

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Verisign earnings calendar 2026 (Google)
2. Verisign price news February 2026 (Google News)
3. Summarize upcoming events for VRSN before 11 Feb 2026, including earnings release schedule, regulatory decisions, and recent analyst revisions; provide historical price reaction to last three earnings reports. (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. VeriSign Q4 2025 earnings date (Google)
2. VRSN stock news February 2026 (Google News)
3. Latest coverage on VeriSign earnings expectations and .com price cap decision in early February 2026 (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Scheduled catalysts, historical earnings reactions, analyst revisions | Current news, earnings expectations, recent institutional activity |
| Content type | Calendar events, price patterns, contract/regulatory context | Real-time price, analyst sentiment, institutional flows |
| Unique contribution | Established Feb 5 earnings date and historical reaction patterns | Confirmed current price ($244.23), consensus EPS ($2.28-2.29), analyst ratings |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets were reasonably discrete. Historical queries focused on establishing patterns and catalyst timing, while current queries surfaced recent price action and sentiment.
- Historical queries successfully targeted base rate establishment by requesting historical price reactions to last three earnings (Q1-25: +9.3%, Q2-25: +6.5%, Q3-25: -1.3% or -7.5% depending on source interpretation).
- Current queries surfaced the critical information that the stock was trading at $244.23, below both 50-day ($247.26) and 200-day ($260.87) moving averages.
- **Critical information gap:** The research did not clearly establish whether the Q3-25 post-earnings drop was -1.3% or -7.5%. Different sources and forecasters interpreted this differently, creating downstream inconsistency.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remained appropriately factual. The Agent report synthesized historical price reactions without offering probability estimates. AskNews articles provided institutional activity data without forecasting implications. The research quality was appropriately informational rather than predictive.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Q4-25 earnings release on Feb 5, 2026 (after market close)
  - Current price $244.23, well below moving averages
  - Historical earnings reactions (2 positive, 1 negative in last 3 quarters)
  - Analyst consensus: "Hold" with $282 target; mixed ratings (Zacks "Strong Sell", Citigroup "Buy")
  - 92.90% institutional ownership
  - Ongoing insider selling by CEO Bidzos

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Clarity on actual Q3-25 price reaction magnitude (-1.3% vs -7.5%)
  - Options-implied volatility for Feb 5 earnings

- **Source quality:** Good overall. MarketBeat, Barchart, and MarketScreener provided reliable data. The Agent report was comprehensive. AskNews returned several irrelevant tickers (VRNS, VRSSF, VRME) which reduced efficiency but forecasters correctly filtered these.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Evaluated 7 sources individually, noting quality levels, distinguishing facts from opinions. Correctly identified MarketScreener as "excellent" and Nasdaq extraction as "poor/unusable." Flagged WallStreetZen formatting issues while accepting core data.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Considered three reference classes: (1) general 6-day stock movements, (2) VRSN earnings-week movements, (3) software infrastructure stocks. Selected VRSN earnings-related movements as most suitable.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct. Identified 6 trading days with earnings on day 2 (Feb 5 after close). Examined Q1-25, Q2-25, Q3-25 patterns. Noted post-earnings buffer of 4 days.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear calculation. Started with 67% (2/3 positive recent earnings), adjusted for current weakness (-5%), recent negative reaction (-7%), time buffer (+3%), no new catalyst (-3%) = 55%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 55% probability through explicit adjustments from 67% base rate
- Considered both Yes (historical precedent, valuation support) and No (recent weakness, Q3-25 negative) pathways thoroughly

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematically evaluated 7 sources with quality ratings. Correctly identified that the "67% recent earnings positive reactions" and "slight upward drift" supported a higher than 50% baseline.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Combined VRSN earnings-related movements with general 8-day holding periods. Reasonable but less precise than S1-1's focused selection.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct. Identified 8 calendar days / 6 trading days. Analyzed key temporal factors including the Feb 5 catalyst.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear but more complex. Calculated 67% * 85% (if positive) + 33% * 35% (if negative) = ~69%, then adjusted down for technical weakness to reach 63%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 63% through probabilistic weighting of earnings outcomes
- Good consideration of asymmetric payoff structure (large gains vs small losses)
- Perhaps overweighted the positive scenario given Q3-25 precedent

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Good but more concise. Evaluated sources with quality ratings, correctly identified the Agent report as most useful synthesis. Less granular than Sonnet outputs.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent methodology. Explicitly considered: (1) all large-cap stocks 1-2 weeks, (2) low-beta infrastructure stocks, (3) stocks during earnings week. Selected blend of (1) and (3) with clear justification against overfitting to 3 VRSN samples.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct. Noted 8 calendar days, 6 trading days, and that earnings increases variance more than direction.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Appropriately conservative. Anchored at 52-54% for short horizon, combined with earnings-week conditioning (50-53%), arrived at 55%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 55% with clear methodological restraint
- Explicitly avoided overfitting to small sample of VRSN earnings
- Strong calibration reasoning

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Concise evaluation of sources with reliability ratings. Correctly identified that no source supplied usable directional forecasts.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent. Considered: (1) VRSN 6-day windows since 2010 (54% positive), (2) large-cap software infrastructure (53%), (3) S&P 500 constituents (56%). Selected VRSN itself as most suitable, citing its idiosyncratic low-volatility profile.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Precise. Stated 6 trading sessions, mean 6-day return +0.25%, std ~3.9%, positive 54% of time. Noted earnings adds ~+2pp.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear calculation: 54% base + 2% calendar/earnings + 1% beta-weighted drift = 57%. Well-grounded in data.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 57% with explicit quantitative anchors
- Most rigorous use of historical statistics among all forecasters
- Appropriately modest adjustments

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Evaluated sources with reliability ratings. Correctly categorized Agent report as "logically consistent and source-transparent."
- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Explicitly rejected S&P 500 and generic tech stocks in favor of "VRSN itself over one-week windows that include an earnings release" as most specific. Referenced 7/12 positive earnings windows (58%).
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct. Calculated 6 trading sessions, historical weekly return mean +0.25%, sigma ~2.5%, positive 54% of time. Added earnings-week specificity.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear: 51% generic weekly base + 7% earnings-week uplift + 2% macro drift - 3% model uncertainty = 57%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 57% with explicit uncertainty discount
- Recognized that earnings-day direction is only "mildly positive"
- Good calibration approach

- **Score:** 14/16

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 55% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 57% |

| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 57% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent. Classified evidence as Strong (earnings catalyst, technical position, insider selling), Moderate (Q3-25 precedent, analyst consensus shift), and Weak (institutional activity, YTD comparison). Correctly identified Q3-25 reaction as "damning" precedent.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 55% -> Output: 45%, Delta = -10pp). Justified by: Q3-25 precedent (-8%), recent price weakness (-5%), insider selling (-3%), partially offset by oversold bounce potential (+4%) and time buffer (+2%).
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Noted that halving would increase probability to 60-62%, doubling would decrease to 48-50%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All six elements addressed with specific evidence citations.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (downward) matched the evidence direction (Q3-25 negative precedent, recent weakness)
- Final 45% is internally consistent with stated reasoning about market demanding more than just beats
- Largest adjustment in the ensemble; most bearish interpretation of the evidence

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Explicitly categorized evidence into Strong (earnings catalyst, technical position, analyst consensus), Moderate (insider selling, institutional rotation), and Weak (Q4 expectations, fundamentals).
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 57% -> Output: 59%, Delta = +2pp). Small upward adjustment: earnings catalyst (+2pp), oversold condition (+2pp), insider selling (-2pp), earnings uncertainty (-1pp), short window (+1pp).
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Noted halving would shift to ~58-60%, doubling to ~60-62%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All elements present with clear citations.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (slightly upward) reflects balance of positive and negative factors
- Final 59% consistent with modest confidence given earnings uncertainty
- Appropriately conservative given input from rigorous S1-4

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Organized into Strong (earnings catalyst), Moderate (expectations, prior quarter reaction, technical context), and Weak (institutional flows, analyst targets, insider selling). Correctly identified that "beat doesn't guarantee positive price action."
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 63% -> Output: 57%, Delta = -6pp). Downward adjustment: "beat but down" precedent + technical weakness (-6pp), offset by steady fundamentals (+0-1pp).
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. If halved, move to 52-55%; if doubled, 58-62%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Six items addressed with specific references.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (downward) appropriate given Q3-25 precedent
- Final 57% reflects moderation from higher input
- Good engagement with cross-pollinated input (acknowledged and adjusted from 63% anchor)

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Categorized as Strong (earnings inside window), Moderate (repeat EPS beats, buyback capacity), Weak (insider selling, mixed ratings). Correctly noted buyback window reopens Feb 10.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 55% -> Output: 57%, Delta = +2pp). Adjustments: EPS beats history (+1.5pp), buyback capacity (+1pp), sub-MA technicals (-1pp). Net +2pp from 55% anchor.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Halving would drop ~2pp toward 50%; doubling would add 1-2pp.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All elements present including blind spot (earnings miss risk).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (slightly upward) reflects net positive of moderate evidence
- Final 57% internally consistent
- Novel insight about buyback window reopening Feb 10 (not mentioned by other forecasters)

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Strong evidence: 7/12 earnings-week hit rate (58%), 54% generic 6-day positive. Moderate: analyst consensus +14% EPS growth, macro backdrop. Weak: insider selling, mixed ratings.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 57% -> Output: 58%, Delta = +1pp). Calculation: 54% base + 4% earnings-week uplift + 2% macro drift - 1% insider/sentiment = 59%, rounded to 58%.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Halving would drop to ~53%, doubling would add 1-2pp.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All six elements addressed.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (slightly upward) appropriate
- Final 58% internally consistent with stated reasoning
- Most quantitatively grounded inside view analysis

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 55% | 45% | -10pp | 15/16 | Yes - well-justified bearish interpretation |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 57% | 59% | +2pp | 14/16 | Yes - modest adjustment for balanced evidence |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 63% | 57% | -6pp | 14/16 | Yes - appropriate moderation from high input |
| S2-4 | o3 | 55% | 57% | +2pp | 14/16 | Yes - buyback and macro factors |
| S2-5 | o3 | 57% | 58% | +1pp | 14/16 | Yes - modest uplift with quantitative basis |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4 from o3):** Engaged meaningfully with the 57% input, making only modest adjustments. The cross-model pollination appeared effective - S2-2 accepted the rigorous statistical foundation from o3 while adding its own evidence weighting.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2 from Sonnet 4.5):** Appropriately moderated the higher 63% input down to 57% based on Q3-25 precedent. Good engagement - did not simply accept the higher estimate but critically evaluated it against current evidence.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3 from GPT-5.2):** Started from 55% and moved slightly up to 57%. The cross-pollination added incremental value with the buyback window observation.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):**
  - S2-1 (Sonnet receiving S1-1) showed the largest adjustment (-10pp), suggesting the self-model pathway allowed for more aggressive interpretation
  - S2-5 (o3 receiving S1-5) showed minimal adjustment (+1pp), maintaining consistency with the statistical approach

- **Diversity impact:** Cross-pollination maintained reasonable diversity (45%-59% range) while preventing wild divergence. The cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) all converged toward 57-59%, while the same-model instances showed more variability (45% and 58%).

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: VRSN close on Feb 11 must exceed close on Feb 3.
- All correctly identified the 6 trading day / 8 calendar day window.
- All correctly identified Feb 5 earnings as the dominant catalyst within the window.
- Current status accurately assessed: $244.23, below both MAs, down YTD.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Q4-25 earnings release on Feb 5, 2026 after market close
2. Current price approximately $244.23, below 50-day MA ($247.26) and 200-day MA ($260.87)
3. 92.90% institutional ownership
4. Mixed analyst ratings with "Hold" consensus around $282 target
5. CEO Bidzos has been selling shares (multiple transactions Oct-Jan)
6. Beta approximately 0.75

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1 | Inconsistent Q3-25 reaction | Cited -1.3% for Q3-25 reaction, while S2-1 later cited -7.5% | Medium |
| S1-2 | Different Q3-25 interpretation | Used -7.5% figure in inside view analysis | Medium |
| Barchart source | Vague magnitude | Stated "down >1%" which could mean -1.3% or -7.5% | Low |

**Root cause:** The Q3-25 earnings reaction had two different measurements:
- The immediate next-day move (likely -1.3%)
- The broader post-earnings decline including subsequent days (-7.5%)

Both may be technically correct depending on measurement window, but this ambiguity was not explicitly resolved.

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. All cited facts traced back to research sources. The different Q3-25 figures appear to be measurement window differences rather than fabrications.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive research coverage:** Successfully identified the key earnings catalyst, current technical position, and sentiment indicators.
2. **Methodologically sound outside views:** All five forecasters used explicit reference classes and transparent calibration processes.
3. **Appropriate cross-pollination engagement:** Cross-model instances critically evaluated their inputs rather than blindly accepting them.
4. **Good calibration checklists:** All inside view analyses completed the full checklist with specific evidence.
5. **Novel insights:** S2-4 identified the buyback window reopening on Feb 10 as a potential positive factor.

### Weaknesses
1. **Inconsistent Q3-25 interpretation:** The -1.3% vs -7.5% discrepancy was not resolved, leading to different interpretations of the most recent comparable event.
2. **Wide S2-1 divergence:** At 45%, S2-1 was 12-14pp below the other forecasters, creating meaningful spread. While the bearish reasoning was well-justified, this outlier significantly pulled down the final average.
3. **AskNews quality issues:** Multiple irrelevant tickers (VRNS, VRSSF, VRME) polluted the research, though forecasters correctly filtered them.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

The forecast demonstrated good research, methodologically sound reasoning across all five forecasters, and appropriate handling of the key earnings catalyst. The main weaknesses were the unresolved Q3-25 reaction discrepancy and the outlier bearish forecast from S2-1. The final prediction of 55.2% is reasonable for a stock with an earnings release mid-window, trading below key moving averages, with mixed analyst sentiment.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Query specificity for price reactions:** Include explicit queries for "VRSN price change October 24 2025" to get precise post-earnings reaction data rather than relying on potentially inconsistent secondary sources.
2. **Options-implied move:** Add a query for VRSN options straddle pricing to understand market-implied volatility expectations.
3. **Ticker disambiguation:** Add explicit exclusion terms to avoid VRNS/VRSSF/VRME contamination in AskNews queries.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Reconcile factual discrepancies:** When sources provide conflicting data (e.g., -1.3% vs -7.5%), the pipeline should flag this for explicit resolution before forecasters proceed.
2. **Outlier detection:** Consider flagging when one forecaster's output diverges by >10pp from the mean, prompting a consistency check.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-1):** The bearish interpretation was well-reasoned but significantly more pessimistic than other forecasters. Consider whether this represents valuable diversity or systematic bias toward recent negative precedent.
- **o3 (S1-4, S1-5, S2-4, S2-5):** Consistently the most quantitatively grounded forecasters, with explicit historical statistics. This rigor is valuable.
- **GPT-5.2 (S1-3, S2-3):** Good methodological restraint in avoiding overfitting to small samples. Appropriately moderated the high S1-2 input.
