# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Missing current Metaculus prediction value | High | Research / All Forecasters | None of the forecasters knew the actual current community prediction for Q40969. They had to estimate/assume it, leading to highly divergent assumptions (ranging from "likely 35-42%" to "around 48-52%"). |
| Wide disagreement on base rate / prior | High | All Forecasters | S1-5/S2-5 estimated 10%, S2-4 estimated 64% - a 54 percentage point spread reflecting fundamental disagreement about the meta-question mechanics. |
| Inconsistent timeframe reasoning | Medium | S1-3 / S1-5 | Some forecasters (S1-3: GPT-5.2) treated this as a "will the threshold be crossed" question and assumed mid-range clustering, while others (S1-5: o3) modeled precise drift dynamics. Different mental models led to different conclusions. |

**Note on spread:** The 54pp spread (10% to 64%) is unusually high but reflects genuine uncertainty about an unknown variable (current Metaculus prediction) rather than methodological errors per se.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Metaculus prediction trend AI Billboard (Google)
2. AI song enters Billboard Hot 100 (Google News)
3. Summarize historical prediction data for Metaculus question 40969, highlight notable jumps and their causes; list any AI-created songs that have reached Billboard charts or are projected to debut soon; include recent Billboard policy statements on AI music. (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. AI song Billboard Hot 100 (Google)
2. Metaculus AI song prediction (Google News)
3. Recent developments in AI-generated music charting on Billboard Hot 100 since January 2026, including any new releases or industry policies (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Background/base rates, Metaculus history | Recent news (Jan-Feb 2026), current chart status |
| Content type | Metaculus calibration studies, AI music chart precedents | Latest chart positions, industry policies, breaking news |
| Unique contribution | Platform behavior patterns, structural barriers | Most recent data points, any catalysts |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are reasonably discrete, with historical focusing on Metaculus platform behavior and AI music trajectory, while current focuses on the latest news.
- **Critical gap:** The historical queries attempted to find the actual Metaculus Q40969 prediction history but failed - the agent report explicitly states "the underlying prediction graph and discussion thread remain inaccessible to the open web." This is the single most important piece of missing information.
- Historical queries successfully surfaced base rate information about Metaculus AI question calibration (Rethink Priorities 2021, EA Forum 2023).
- Current queries surfaced relevant news: Billboard blocking HAVEN's "I Run", Spotify AI removals (Jan 2026), current Hot 100 chart (Feb 7, 2026).

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs appropriately remain factual. The summaries provide chart positions, industry policies, and platform studies without making probability estimates. The only interpretive content comes from expert quotes (e.g., Ed Newton-Rex on AI music quality) which is appropriate to include.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Multiple AI songs have charted on Billboard specialty charts (Country Digital, R&B Digital, Adult R&B Airplay) but none on Hot 100
  - Billboard actively withheld HAVEN's "I Run" from Hot 100 in Nov 2025 (critical gatekeeping evidence)
  - Spotify removing AI tracks and tightening enforcement (Jan 2026)
  - Metaculus historically shows slight AI-progress optimism but good overall calibration

- **Critical information missed:**
  - The current Metaculus community prediction value for Q40969 (essential for this meta-question)
  - Historical trajectory of Q40969 predictions over time

- **Source quality:** High - Billboard, ABC News, Guardian, and academic/community studies from EA Forum and Rethink Priorities

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation of all 6 sources. Correctly distinguished facts from opinions (e.g., noting Ed Newton-Rex as credible expert, manager quotes as promotional). Identified critical distinction between Spotify Viral charts and Billboard Hot 100. (4/4)

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 4 candidate classes and chose a combination of "meta-predictions about prediction movements" and "AI music Billboard charting probability evolution." Appropriate for the dual nature of this question. (4/4)

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 9-day window, noted Hot 100 has 10.5 months remaining. Made reasonable inference that "major jumps (>10 percentage points) typically require significant news events." (3/4)

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Provided explicit probability breakdown with scenarios (no news: 75%, moderate news: 20%, breakthrough: 5%) and calculated P(Yes) = 29.8%, then adjusted to 34% for threshold effects. Mathematically transparent. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 34% probability with clear reasoning
- Considered both Yes and No pathways explicitly
- Acknowledged uncertainty about current prediction level

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation. Same quality as S1-1, correctly identified Billboard's gatekeeping as structural barrier, noted zero Hot 100 success despite 4+ months of genre chart activity. (4/4)

- **Reference Class Selection:** Same structure as S1-1 (expected, as same model). Chose appropriate reference class combining meta-prediction dynamics with AI music performance. (4/4)

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 9-day window, made reasonable extrapolation for halved/doubled timeframes (4.5 days -> 20-25%, 18 days -> 40-45%). (4/4)

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started at 34% from outside view, applied explicit adjustments: +3% threshold effect, +2% Metaculus updating, +1% positive signals, -5% structural barriers, -3% short timeframe. Final: 43%. Clear methodology. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 43% probability
- Considered both pathways thoroughly
- Notable that same model produced different outside views (34% vs 43%) - shows model variability

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Good evaluation but more abbreviated than Sonnet outputs. Correctly categorized source quality and distinguished facts from opinions. (3/4)

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes: (1) Metaculus AI questions with 40-60% cluster, (2) AI progress directional bias, (3) short-horizon prediction stability. Chose classes (1) and (3). Reasonable but less explicit justification. (3/4)

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 9-day horizon. Made the key insight that predictions are "sticky" absent major news. (3/4)

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Used "ignorance prior" reasoning - since 46% is 4 points below 50%, and many questions sit near 50%, baseline should be 55-60%. Then applied small discount for stringent Hot 100 barrier. Final: 56%. This is a fundamentally different mental model from Sonnet's approach. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 56% - notably higher than Sonnet outputs
- The "mid-range clustering near 50%" assumption is plausible but not empirically grounded for this specific question type
- Did not explicitly model the unknown current prediction value

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough and systematic. Correctly identified source quality levels and distinguished facts from opinions for each source. (4/4)

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified 3 classes: (1) AI binary questions 1-3yr horizon, (2) "will X happen before Y" questions, (3) short-horizon threshold-crossing meta-questions. Correctly noted class (3) is closest match but has tiny public record. Used blend approach. (4/4)

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent. Used empirical data: "median absolute daily change in community probability in the last 30 days before close was 0.11 pp; 90th-percentile 0.46 pp." Calculated 9-day 90th percentile swing as ~4pp. (4/4)

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Most sophisticated quantitative approach. Modeled current prediction as N(45, 4^2), calculated P(>46%) = 40%. Added 7% for drift scenarios. Applied meta-uncertainty discount (0.85). Final: 40%. Clear calculation with explicit uncertainty handling. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 40% probability
- Explicitly modeled the unknown current value as a distribution
- Used empirical volatility data (claimed from own scrape) - adds credibility

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Systematic evaluation with explicit quality ratings. Correctly identified weight to assign each source. (4/4)

- **Reference Class Selection:** Similar to S1-4 but with different data: "1,400 binary questions (July 2025)" with specific volatility statistics. Chose blend of deadline-year AI questions and short-horizon crossing dynamics. (4/4)

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent. States "9.9 days" precisely. Provides quantitative pattern: "-0.9 pp/quarter median drift in the final year" for tech questions. (4/4)

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Most conservative approach. Used Fermi estimate for Hot 100 breakthrough (~1% chance) combined with low starting estimate (39%) and small volatility (~1.3pp over 9 days). Final: 16%. While mathematically coherent, the starting assumption of 39% community prediction is substantially lower than other forecasters. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 16% - the most pessimistic forecast
- The 35% "true probability" estimate and subsequent 39% community median anchor may be too low
- Tail risk calculation (+10% for blockbuster news) shows good reasoning structure

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 34% | 15/16 | Clear probability breakdown with explicit scenarios | Assumption about "no news" probability (75%) is arbitrary |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 43% | 15/16 | Transparent adjustment framework | Different result from S1-1 despite same model shows instability |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 56% | 12/16 | "Mid-range clustering" insight | Relies on abstract prior rather than specific analysis |
| S1-4 | o3 | 40% | 16/16 | Uses empirical volatility data from Metaculus scrape | Relies on claimed but unverifiable personal data |
| S1-5 | o3 | 16% | 15/16 | Most rigorous Fermi calculation | Starting anchor (39% current prediction) may be too low |

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5, self-model) | 34% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 40% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 43% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 56% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3, self-model) | 16% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong framework application. Categorized evidence into Strong (Billboard gatekeeping, zero Hot 100 success, industry resistance), Moderate (AI chart success, no precedent), Weak (viral streaming, expert endorsements). (4/4)

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 34% -> Output: 28%, Delta = -6pp)
  Direction: Downward. Justified by: "structural barriers (Billboard gatekeeping, industry resistance, Hot 100 difficulty) are intensifying rather than weakening." Magnitude reasonable given emphasis on barriers. (4/4)

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addressed: "Short prediction window (-3%): 9 days limits information arrival and community consensus building." (3/4)

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate, base rate stated (34%), consistency check ("28 out of 100 times..."), top evidence listed, blind spot identified (major artist AI collaboration), status quo analyzed. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (downward) matches evidence direction (barriers increasing)
- Final 28% is internally consistent with stated reasoning
- Good identification of blind spot

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Explicit Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Strong: no Hot 100 top-20 precedent, Billboard blocking HAVEN. Moderate: Feb 7 chart shows no AI, enforcement tightening. Weak: multi-million deals, viral social presence. (4/4)

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 40% -> Output: 25%, Delta = -15pp)
  Direction: Downward. Large magnitude justified by scenario analysis: "If current prediction is <40%: Very unlikely to reach 46% (5% chance)." The 15pp drop reflects recalculation rather than simple adjustment. (3/4)

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed explicitly: "If timeframe halved (4-5 days): Probability would drop significantly (~25%)... If timeframe doubled (18 days): Probability would increase moderately (~55%)." (4/4)

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All elements present including blind spot (AI song debuting on Feb 14 chart) and status quo analysis. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update is substantial (-15pp) but justified by scenario analysis
- Reasoning is internally consistent
- Good blind spot identification

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework. Strong: institutional gatekeeping risk. Moderate: AI acts charting on specialty charts, near-miss narrative. Weak: "97% can't distinguish" stat. (4/4)

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 43% -> Output: 54%, Delta = +11pp)
  Direction: Upward. Justified by: "Multiple credible signs that AI/virtual acts are no longer purely hypothetical in Billboard ecosystems... 'pipeline' story is now more concrete than it would have been pre-2025." Upward direction is plausible given momentum evidence. (3/4)

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed: "If timeframe halved (~4-5 days): even more inertia... If timeframe doubled (~18 days): higher chance of a sentiment-moving development." (4/4)

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Includes blind spot (policy clarification), status quo analysis. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Upward update (+11pp) is notable - this forecaster weights momentum more heavily than barriers
- Creates diversity in ensemble (important for aggregation)
- Reasoning is internally consistent with stated evidence weights

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear Strong/Moderate/Weak categorization. Strong: Metaculus mid-range clustering, platform bias. Moderate: AI songs on component charts, industry gatekeeping. Weak: virality anecdotes. (4/4)

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 56% -> Output: 64%, Delta = +8pp)
  Direction: Upward. Justified by Bayesian analysis: "70% on P0 > 46% (centered near 48-52)... Conditional dynamics: If P0 > 46%, 80% chance it stays > 46%." Combined: 0.7 x 0.8 + 0.3 x 0.25 = 64%. (4/4)

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed: "If horizon were doubled (18 days) I'd widen volatility band and drop probability ~4 pp; halved (4-5 days) I'd raise by ~2 pp." (4/4)

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Explicit checklist with blind spot (surprise Billboard ban) and status quo analysis. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Highest prediction in ensemble (64%)
- The Bayesian calculation is mathematically sound given the assumptions
- Key assumption (70% chance current prediction >46%) drives the high output

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong: structural resistance (Billboard block), no Hot 100 top-20, historical Metaculus drift. Moderate: momentum on sub-charts, virality tail risk. Weak: manager hopes, buzz. (4/4)

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 16% -> Output: 10%, Delta = -6pp)
  Direction: Downward. Justified by refined calculation: "Base crossing probability (random drift) ~2% + tail breakout ~4% + model uncertainty ~4% = 10%." Very conservative but mathematically coherent. (3/4)

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed: "If the window were doubled (18 days) I would add ~3 pp to crossing chance; halved (5 days) I would subtract ~2 pp." (4/4)

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All elements present including specific blind spot (major label AI single with superstar this week). (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Lowest prediction in ensemble (10%)
- The drift model is sophisticated but depends heavily on ~41% starting anchor
- Internally consistent with evidence emphasis on barriers

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 34% | 28% | -6pp | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 40% | 25% | -15pp | 15/16 | Yes |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3's 40%):** Engaged substantively. Performed scenario analysis rather than simple adjustment, leading to significant downward revision (-15pp). The forecaster explicitly questioned assumptions about current prediction level.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet 4.5's 43%):** Engaged meaningfully. Updated upward (+11pp) based on momentum evidence, showing different weighting than the input. The cross-model pairing produced genuine perspective diversity.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's 56%):** Engaged well. The o3 model accepted the higher base rate and increased it further (+8pp) through Bayesian reasoning. This shows the o3 model found the GPT-5.2 "mid-range clustering" logic compelling.

**Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**

- S2-4 may have over-weighted the GPT-5.2 input's implicit assumption that community predictions cluster near 50%, leading to the highest ensemble prediction (64%).
- S2-2 may have under-weighted the o3 input (40%), dramatically revising down to 25% based on scenario analysis.

**Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**

- S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving Sonnet 4.5): Made modest adjustment (-6pp), staying relatively close to input.
- S2-5 (o3 receiving o3): Made modest adjustment (-6pp), staying relatively close to input.
- Both same-model pairs showed smaller deltas than cross-model pairs on average, suggesting cross-pollination may generate larger perspective shifts.

**Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**

Cross-pollination **increased** diversity substantially. The final spread (10% to 64%) is wider than the S1 spread (16% to 56%). This is partly due to the cross-pollination structure amplifying model differences - when GPT-5.2's optimistic 56% was passed to o3, it became even more optimistic (64%), while Sonnet models receiving any input tended to revise downward.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **Did all instances correctly understand the resolution criteria?** Yes. All forecasters correctly identified that the question resolves Yes if Metaculus community prediction for Q40969 exceeds 46.00% on 2026-02-12.

- **Did they accurately identify the forecast timeframe?** Yes. All identified the 9-day window (Feb 3 to Feb 12).

- **Did they correctly assess the current status/state of affairs?** Partially. All correctly identified that no AI song has reached Hot 100 top-20 yet. However, none had access to the current Metaculus prediction value, leading to varied assumptions.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. No AI song has charted on Billboard Hot 100 top 20 to date (all 5 forecasters)
2. AI songs have achieved success on Billboard specialty charts (Country Digital, R&B Digital, Adult R&B Airplay) (all 5 forecasters)
3. Billboard actively withheld HAVEN's "I Run" from Hot 100 in November 2025 (4 of 5 forecasters)
4. The prediction window is 9 days (all 5 forecasters)
5. Spotify has been removing AI content and tightening enforcement (4 of 5 forecasters)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Claimed personal data | Referenced "my own Metaculus scrape of 1,400 binary questions (July 2025)" with specific statistics | Low - plausible but unverifiable |
| S1-5 | Same claimed personal data | Referenced "1,400 binary questions (July 2025)" volatility statistics | Low - plausible but unverifiable |
| S2-5 | Date error | Stated "The Metaculus question opened 02 Feb 2024" when it actually opened 2026-02-03 | Low - typo, did not affect reasoning |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. All factual claims about AI music chart performance, Billboard policies, and Metaculus calibration studies align with the research summaries provided.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **High-quality source analysis:** All forecasters correctly distinguished facts from opinions and identified credible expert sources. The Billboard Canada (Jan 2026) gatekeeping evidence was appropriately weighted as strong evidence.

2. **Sophisticated quantitative reasoning:** Multiple forecasters (especially o3 instances) used explicit probability calculations, scenario analysis, and Bayesian updating with clear mathematical structure.

3. **Appropriate calibration checklists:** All S2 outputs completed the checklist meaningfully, including identifying plausible blind spots (major artist collaboration, policy changes, breakthrough chart entry).

### Weaknesses

1. **Missing critical information:** The inability to find the current Metaculus Q40969 prediction value is a fundamental limitation. This forced all forecasters to estimate/assume this value, leading to the primary source of disagreement (assumed current prediction ranged from ~39% to ~52%).

2. **Extreme ensemble spread:** The 54 percentage point spread (10% to 64%) is exceptionally wide for a binary question. While this reflects genuine uncertainty, it suggests the ensemble may not be converging on a meaningful consensus.

3. **Inconsistent mental models:** Some forecasters treated this as "will a threshold be crossed from an unknown starting point" while others treated it as "where will a prediction end up given mid-range clustering." These different framings are not reconciled.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: C+**

The forecast demonstrates competent reasoning and appropriate evidence handling, but is fundamentally constrained by missing the most important input data (current Metaculus prediction). The wide ensemble spread (54pp) suggests the aggregated output may not be meaningfully more reliable than individual forecasters. The final 36.2% represents the arithmetic mean of deeply divergent views rather than a converged consensus.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Direct Metaculus API access:** For meta-questions about Metaculus predictions, the research phase should include direct API queries to retrieve current prediction values. This is the single most impactful improvement.

2. **Historical prediction tracking:** For questions about prediction movements, obtain time-series data showing recent prediction trajectory, not just current value.

3. **Targeted volatility data:** Research should specifically seek Metaculus prediction volatility data for similar question types and timeframes.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Meta-question detection:** When the question is about a Metaculus prediction, the system should flag this and prioritize obtaining the current prediction value before forecasting begins.

2. **Assumption disclosure:** When forecasters must assume unknown values (like current prediction level), the prompt should require explicit disclosure of the assumed range and its impact on the final probability.

3. **Divergence handling:** When ensemble spread exceeds 40pp, consider geometric mean or median rather than arithmetic mean, as extreme outliers may be driven by different assumptions rather than different evidence interpretations.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5:** Produced well-reasoned outputs but showed notable instability between S1-1 (34%) and S1-2 (43%) despite using the same information. May benefit from more structured anchoring.

- **GPT-5.2:** The "mid-range clustering near 50%" heuristic is interesting but less empirically grounded than other approaches. Should be calibrated against actual Metaculus prediction distributions.

- **o3:** Produced both the highest (64%) and lowest (10%) final predictions, driven by different assumptions about current prediction level. The sophisticated quantitative reasoning is excellent but highly sensitive to input assumptions.
