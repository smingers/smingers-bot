# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Divergent base rate assumptions | Medium | S1-1/S1-2 vs S1-4/S1-5 | Forecasters adopted very different outside view distributions (60-62% Decreases vs 24% Decreases), reflecting fundamentally different interpretations of the reference class |
| Inconsistent treatment of Feb 3 baseline | Medium | S2-1 vs S2-4 | S2-1 explicitly identified Feb 3 as "artificially elevated" from Feb 1-2 news, while S2-4 treated it as uncertain whether a spike had occurred |
| Missing actual Google Trends data | Medium | Research | Agent report explicitly notes "the numeric series is still not in hand" - forecasters extrapolated from news coverage patterns rather than actual search data |
| Aggregation washes out model-specific insights | Low | Aggregation | Equal-weighted average of 5 very different distributions obscures the reasoning diversity; final prediction (20.4%/32%/47.6%) doesn't reflect any single forecaster's view |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Thom Tillis February 2026 news (Google)
2. Thom Tillis 2026 scandal rumors (Google News)
3. Google Trends thom tillis daily January-February 2026 volatility analysis (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. Thom Tillis upcoming events 2026 (Google)
2. Thom Tillis latest news 2026 (Google News)
3. List any recent or scheduled news events, investigations, legislation, or high-profile appearances involving U.S. Senator Thom Tillis expected between February 3 and February 10 2026 (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Past month patterns, January 2026 events | Feb 3-10 2026 specifically |
| Content type | News events, volatility patterns, scandal context | Scheduled events, breaking news, upcoming catalysts |
| Unique contribution | Base rate establishment, controversy timeline | Real-time news (Warsh nomination story Feb 1-2) |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are appropriately discrete with minimal overlap. Historical queries focused on establishing patterns and context, while current queries targeted decision-relevant near-term information.
- Historical queries successfully surfaced the key controversies (Greenland, Noem, Miller criticism) that established Tillis as a recurring newsmaker in January 2026.
- Current queries critically surfaced the breaking Warsh nomination story (Feb 1-2, 2026), which became the dominant factor in forecaster reasoning.
- **Critical gap:** The Agent search for actual Google Trends data failed - the report explicitly states "the numeric series is still not in hand." Forecasters had to extrapolate from news patterns rather than actual search data.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remain appropriately factual. The query generation analysis does include preliminary probability estimates ("base-rate favors 'Doesn't change' at ~60-70%"), which is borderline but acceptable since it's framed as establishing a prior for refinement. The actual search results are news summaries without embedded forecasts.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Warsh nomination breaking news (Feb 1-2, 2026) - central to all forecaster reasoning
  - Tillis's role blocking Fed nominees and White House attacks on him
  - Timeline of January controversies (Greenland, Noem, Miller)
  - Tillis's retirement status (not seeking reelection)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Actual Google Trends daily data for January-February 2026
  - Historical volatility patterns for the specific search term
  - Scheduled Senate Banking Committee activities for Feb 3-10

- **Source quality:** Excellent. Multiple high-quality sources (CNN, CNBC, Guardian, NYPost, WRAL) with independent confirmation of key facts. The Warsh nomination story was covered by 10+ independent outlets.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Evaluated each source individually with publication dates, quality assessments, and fact vs. opinion distinctions. Correctly identified the key factual timeline (retirement, Greenland, ICE shooting, Noem, Miller). Noted CNN piece was "thin evidence."

- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified 4 reference classes (retiring senators, Trump-criticized politicians, non-election year senators, week-over-week political figures). Selected "politicians involved in ongoing controversies with the administration" - appropriate but could have been more quantitative.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Strong. Correctly identified 7-day window. Described typical Google Trends behavior (3-5 day decay cycles, news-driven spikes). Identified critical factors for Feb 3-10.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Very good. Derived: "60-70% probability of week-over-week decline after news spike, 20-25% stability, 10-15% increase." Applied explicit calibration adjustments resulting in 15% Increases, 23% Doesn't change, 62% Decreases.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Assigned probabilities to all three options (15/23/62)
- Considered all pathways (decay pattern, stability band, unexpected developments)
- Probabilities sum to 100%
- Appropriately weighted toward Decreases based on post-spike decay logic

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Systematic evaluation of each source with quality ratings. Distinguished factual claims from opinion elements. Correctly identified that January 2026 showed multiple controversies creating elevated baseline.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Identified 4 classes (retiring senators, party conflict politicians, NC politicians, week-to-week political figures). Selected "politicians in their final term who periodically clash with party leadership" - well-reasoned.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Strong. Correctly stated 7-day window. Detailed recent pattern analysis (Jan 17, Jan 24, Jan 28, Feb 2 events). Good description of typical Google Trends behavior.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Good. Started with "30-40% no change, 50-60% decrease after spike, 10-20% increase" and calibrated to 13% Increases, 27% Doesn't change, 60% Decreases. Reasonable but less precisely derived than S1-1.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probabilities assigned to all options (13/27/60)
- Sum equals 100%
- Similar structure to S1-1, slightly more conservative on Decreases

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Evaluated sources with quality judgments and date relevance. Noted the key limitation ("we do not have the daily Google Trends series"). Correctly identified recent media salience.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Good but brief. Identified three classes but analysis was less detailed than Sonnet outputs. Selected "mid-tier politician queries with occasional news spikes and mean reversion."

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Adequate. Correctly stated 7-day window. Acknowledged typical short-window pattern but less quantitative than other forecasters.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Moderate. Final distribution (25% Increases, 40% Doesn't change, 35% Decreases) is more centered than other forecasters. Justification was reasonable but less precise - anchored to "uncertainty-aware distribution" without specific base rate calculation.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probabilities assigned to all options (25/40/35)
- Sum equals 100%
- More uncertain/centered distribution - appropriate acknowledgment of uncertainty but potentially underweighted the spike-decay dynamic

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good. Brief but accurate evaluations. Correctly identified all sources as dated before forecast window. Appropriately noted they establish episodic press spikes pattern.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Explicitly referenced pytrends data for similar senators (Murkowski, Cassidy). Provided quantitative estimates: "median absolute day-to-day change ~ 2 points, SD ~ 5, 7-day-apart absolute change >3 in roughly 40% of pairings."

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly identified 7-day horizon and measured base rate against this.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Strong quantitative approach. Started from neutral prior (60% doesn't change, 20/20 split for increases/decreases). Adjusted for uncertainty to 24% Increases, 52% Doesn't change, 24% Decreases. Explicit methodology.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probabilities assigned to all options (24/52/24)
- Sum equals 100%
- Most symmetric distribution - reflects absence of event-timing information in outside view
- Principled approach but potentially underweighted available context about recent news

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Adequate. Brief evaluations with appropriate skepticism. Correctly noted all sources agree on episodic news waves but none supplies actual Trends data.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Referenced similar senators and empirical skim of historical data. Provided quantitative estimate: "7-day-apart absolute change >3 in roughly 60% of pairings, direction symmetric."

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Adequate. Correctly stated 7-day horizon. Noted mean reversion consideration but deferred to inside view.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Principled but potentially too symmetric. Final: 30% Increases, 40% Doesn't change, 30% Decreases. Explicitly stated symmetry assumption "absent specific catalyst."

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probabilities assigned to all options (30/40/30)
- Sum equals 100%
- Most agnostic distribution - appropriate outside view discipline but potentially too uninformative

- **Score:** 11/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 15/23/62 | 14/16 | Comprehensive source analysis, clear calibration reasoning | Could have been more quantitative on reference class |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 13/27/60 | 13/16 | Systematic pattern analysis | Base rate derivation less precise |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 25/40/35 | 11/16 | Appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment | Less quantitative, potentially too centered |
| S1-4 | o3 | 24/52/24 | 13/16 | Explicit quantitative methodology | May underweight available context |
| S1-5 | o3 | 30/40/30 | 11/16 | Disciplined symmetry assumption | Too uninformative given available evidence |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 15/23/62 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 24/52/24 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 13/27/60 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 25/40/35 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 30/40/30 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong. Explicitly categorized evidence as Strong (Warsh nomination breaking news, multiple independent sources), Moderate (ongoing confirmation battle, committee dynamics), and Weak (speculation). Correctly identified the key insight: "The outside view analysis did not account for the Feb 1-2 Warsh nomination breaking news."

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 15/23/62 -> Output: 12/20/68, Delta = -3/-3/+6)
  - Direction: Increased Decreases probability - consistent with elevated Feb 3 baseline from breaking news
  - Magnitude: Modest (+6pp to Decreases) - appropriate given strong decay pattern evidence
  - Justification: "Feb 3 baseline is artificially elevated... comparing '7 days after spike' to '1-2 days after spike'"

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Excellent. "If timeframe halved (3.5 days): Would increase 'Doesn't change' probability significantly (~40%). If timeframe doubled (14 days): Would increase 'Decreases' probability to ~80%."

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate, base rate stated, consistency check performed, key evidence listed, blind spot identified (Trump continues attacking), technicalities verified.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction matched evidence direction (more confident in Decreases given spike timing)
- Final probabilities internally consistent with reasoning about decay from elevated baseline
- Did not contradict stated evidence

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong. Explicitly used Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Identified key factors: Fed Chair nomination as "Tier-1 political story," White House amplification, structural position (swing vote). Good distinction between evidence types.

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 24/52/24 -> Output: 22/31/47, Delta = -2/-21/+23)
  - Direction: Major shift from symmetric to Decreases-favoring
  - Magnitude: Large (+23pp to Decreases, -21pp from Doesn't change)
  - Justification: Well-explained shift based on "Feb 3 is 1-2 days into major story" and typical decay pattern

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. "If timeframe halved: Higher probability of 'Increases'... If timeframe doubled: Higher probability of 'Doesn't change.'" Reasoning is sound.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All elements present with meaningful content. Blind spot identified (Feb 3 baseline surprisingly low).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Large update from symmetric outside view was well-justified given current news context
- Probabilities sum to 100%
- Internal consistency maintained despite major shift

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Identified Strong evidence (Feb 1-2 multi-outlet coverage), Moderate evidence (recent January controversies), Weak evidence (2026 election cycle). Applied framework systematically.

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 13/27/60 -> Output: 17/32/51, Delta = +4/+5/-9)
  - Direction: Shifted probability FROM Decreases to Doesn't change/Increases
  - Magnitude: Modest redistribution
  - Justification: "unlike the 'post-spike decay' framing, we're at the front end of a live, nationally-covered political-economic dispute"

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. "If halved (~3-4 days): less time for news decay; 'Doesn't change' becomes more likely. If doubled (~14 days): 'Decreases' would become more likely."

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All elements present. Blind spot identified (sharp new development on Feb 9-10).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction is interesting - moved AWAY from Decreases, arguing the story is ongoing rather than peaking
- This is a valid alternative interpretation but in tension with other forecasters
- Probabilities properly constrained

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Strong evidence (Warsh-Tillis news burst 1-3 Feb), Moderate evidence (historical decay patterns, lack of scheduled events), Weak evidence (possibility of fresh Trump attacks). Framework applied correctly.

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 25/40/35 -> Output: 24/39/37, Delta = -1/-1/+2)
  - Direction: Very slight shift toward Decreases
  - Magnitude: Minimal adjustment (+2pp)
  - Justification: Applied specific numerical adjustments (+5% toward Decrease, -3% from Same, -2% from Increase, then rebalanced)

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. "If horizon were halved: inertia/noise would raise 'Doesn't change.' Doubled to 14 days, mean-reversion strengthens."

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete but abbreviated. All elements present. Blind spot: "Trump or Senate schedules surprise hearing/media fight 6-9 Feb."

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Conservative update from outside view - maintained relatively centered distribution
- Reasoning is sound but update magnitude seems small given the breaking news evidence
- Probabilities sum to 100%

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Identified strong evidence (1-3 Feb headlines), moderate evidence (no hearings scheduled, historical decay), weak evidence (unpredictable Trump attacks). Clear framework application.

- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 30/40/30 -> Output: 27/38/35, Delta = -3/-2/+5)
  - Direction: Modest shift toward Decreases
  - Magnitude: Small adjustment (+5pp to Decreases)
  - Justification: "Today almost certainly sits near the peak of a media mini-spike (strong evidence). Expect mean-reversion."

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. "If horizon were halved: raise 'Doesn't change' because decay has less time. If doubled: raise 'Decreases' further."

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All elements addressed. Blind spot: "unexpected breaking event (e.g., Trump tweet labelling Tillis 'traitor') on 9-10 Feb."

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Appropriate directional update given evidence
- Maintained significant uncertainty in distribution
- Probabilities sum to 100%

- **Score:** 13/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 15/23/62 | 12/20/68 | -3/-3/+6 | 15/16 | Yes - elevated baseline reasoning |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 24/52/24 | 22/31/47 | -2/-21/+23 | 14/16 | Yes - large but well-justified |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 13/27/60 | 17/32/51 | +4/+5/-9 | 13/16 | Partial - argues ongoing story |
| S2-4 | o3 | 25/40/35 | 24/39/37 | -1/-1/+2 | 12/16 | Yes but conservative |
| S2-5 | o3 | 30/40/30 | 27/38/35 | -3/-2/+5 | 13/16 | Yes - appropriate magnitude |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**
  - S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3): Yes, explicitly engaged with the symmetric 24/52/24 distribution and made a major adjustment based on current news, demonstrating that the inside view can override a symmetric outside view when evidence warrants.
  - S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet): Partially. Engaged with the 13/27/60 distribution but actually moved AGAINST the decay-favoring prior, arguing the story is ongoing. This represents genuine analytical disagreement.
  - S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2): Yes, but conservatively. Received a centered 25/40/35 and made only minimal adjustments despite having access to the same breaking news.

- **Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**
  - S2-4 may have under-weighted the breaking news evidence, making only a +2pp shift to Decreases despite multiple forecasters identifying the Feb 1-2 spike as critical.
  - S2-3's counter-directional update is interesting - it argues the ongoing nature of the story sustains interest, which is a valid but minority view.

- **Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**
  - S2-1 (Sonnet self-receive): Made modest refinements to already-strong Decreases prediction
  - S2-5 (o3 self-receive): Made modest refinements to symmetric prediction
  - Both same-model instances showed smaller deltas than cross-model S2-2, suggesting cross-pollination can drive more substantial reconsideration.

- **Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**
  - Cross-pollination appears to have INCREASED diversity. The final spread is significant (12-27% on Increases, 20-39% on Doesn't change, 35-68% on Decreases). S2-2's large update from a symmetric prior created one of the more moderate Decreases predictions, while S2-1's self-reinforcement maintained the strongest Decreases signal.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **Did all instances correctly understand the resolution criteria?** Yes. All forecasters correctly identified: compare Feb 10 to Feb 3 Google Trends value; "Doesn't change" if within +/-3; "Increases" if >+3; "Decreases" if <-3.

- **Did they accurately identify the forecast timeframe?** Yes. All correctly stated 7-day window (Feb 3-10, 2026).

- **Did they correctly assess the current status/state of affairs?** Yes. All forecasters identified the key current state: Tillis blocking Fed nominees, Warsh nomination just announced, White House attacking Tillis, no scheduled events for Feb 4-10.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Kevin Warsh was nominated as Fed Chair on Feb 1-2, 2026, with Tillis announcing opposition
2. Tillis is not seeking reelection (retiring at end of term)
3. White House Press Secretary Leavitt criticized Tillis by name on Feb 2, 2026
4. Tillis has been in multiple controversies in January 2026 (Greenland, Noem, Miller criticism)
5. The Senate Banking Committee has a narrow 13-11 Republican majority, making Tillis's vote pivotal

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4/S2-4 | Date anomaly notation | Correctly flagged date anomalies in AskNews articles ("February 31") | None - appropriately discounted |
| Multiple | Uncertain Feb 3 baseline | All acknowledged uncertainty about whether Feb 3 value is elevated or not | Medium - central to forecast |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All factual claims about Tillis, the Warsh nomination, and news events were corroborated across multiple independent sources. Forecasters appropriately distinguished between verified facts and speculation.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Excellent research quality:** The research pipeline surfaced the critical breaking news (Warsh nomination Feb 1-2) that was central to all forecaster reasoning. Multiple high-quality sources provided independent confirmation.

2. **Strong methodological discipline:** All forecasters followed the structured framework (source analysis, reference class, timeframe, calibration). The evidence weighting frameworks were consistently applied.

3. **Appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment:** Forecasters correctly identified the key unknowns (Feb 3 baseline level, whether decay would exceed +/-3 threshold, potential for new developments) and reflected this in their probability distributions.

4. **Good cross-pollination dynamics:** The cross-model information flow produced genuine analytical diversity, with S2-2 demonstrating that a symmetric outside view can be appropriately overridden by strong inside-view evidence.

5. **No factual errors or hallucinations:** All forecasters maintained factual accuracy and appropriately distinguished verified information from speculation.

### Weaknesses

1. **Missing quantitative base rate data:** Despite attempting to retrieve actual Google Trends data, the pipeline failed to obtain the numeric series. Forecasters had to extrapolate from news patterns, introducing uncertainty.

2. **Significant prediction spread:** The 56pp spread on "Decreases" (12% to 68%) reflects genuine disagreement about how to interpret the Feb 3 baseline, but also suggests the ensemble may not be fully leveraging collective intelligence.

3. **Aggregation method limitations:** Equal-weighted averaging of very different distributions (symmetric vs. decay-favoring) produces a final prediction that doesn't reflect any single forecaster's view. The final 20.4%/32%/47.6% is a mathematical compromise rather than a coherent position.

4. **Conservative updates from some forecasters:** S2-4 made minimal adjustments (+2pp) despite having access to the same breaking news evidence that drove other forecasters to larger shifts. This could reflect appropriate conservatism or under-responsiveness.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The forecast demonstrates strong research quality, methodological rigor, and factual accuracy. The core reasoning across all forecasters is sound - they correctly identified the key dynamics (post-spike decay vs. ongoing story) and applied appropriate uncertainty. The main weaknesses are (1) the inability to obtain actual Google Trends data and (2) the significant spread in forecaster predictions, which may indicate the ensemble could be better calibrated. However, this spread arguably reflects genuine uncertainty about a difficult forecasting problem.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Add Google Trends API integration:** The agent search attempted to find Trends data but failed. Direct integration with pytrends or the Google Trends API would provide the actual baseline values needed for more precise forecasting.

2. **Include scheduled event calendars:** Senate Banking Committee schedules, known press conferences, and other calendar events would help assess the likelihood of new news during the forecast window.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Consider spread-aware aggregation:** When forecaster spread exceeds a threshold (e.g., 40pp on any option), the pipeline could flag this for human review or apply a different aggregation method (e.g., extremize, geometric mean).

2. **Explicit baseline assessment:** For Google Trends questions, prompt forecasters to explicitly estimate the current baseline level and whether it represents a spike, trough, or normal state.

### Model-Specific Feedback

1. **Sonnet 4.5:** Performed well. Continue using for source analysis and calibration reasoning. S1-1 and S2-1 showed the strongest analytical framework.

2. **GPT-5.2:** The counter-directional update in S2-3 (arguing the story is ongoing rather than peaking) represents a valid minority view. Consider whether this analytical diversity is valuable or introduces noise.

3. **o3:** Conservative update pattern. S2-4's minimal adjustment (+2pp) despite strong evidence may indicate under-responsiveness. Consider whether o3 models need more aggressive calibration prompting.
