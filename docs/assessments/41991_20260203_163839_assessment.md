# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster S2-1 ingested a confusing/misleading Investopedia article containing 2024 data mislabeled as 2026, adopted a false $174.99 closing price and a fictitious -33% YTD decline for BA | Critical | S2-1 | S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5) used the wrong closing price ($174.99 vs. the actual ~$233) and dramatically over-weighted negative momentum, producing a 27% forecast far below its own 34% outside view and far below all peers |
| AskNews current search returned zero Boeing-relevant articles | High | Research | All AskNews results were about unrelated tickers (BAX, BAC, Indian markets, crypto). The ticker "BA" was apparently confused with "BAC" or produced irrelevant matches, leaving the inside view pipeline with no Boeing-specific current news from that source |
| Multiple inside-view forecasters reference a $174.99 BA close and -33% YTD decline that appears factually incorrect | High | S2-1, S2-2, S2-3, S2-4, S2-5 | An Investopedia article with severe date inconsistencies (mixing 2024 events into a 2026-dated article) was treated as factual by several forecasters. The actual BA close on Feb 3, 2026 was approximately $233, not $174.99 |
| Forecaster S2-5 references a "737 MAX fleet grounding" after a Jan 5, 2026 door-plug blow-out that appears to be a hallucinated or conflated event | High | S2-5 | No such grounding in 2026 is supported by any provided source. The Jan 2024 Alaska Airlines incident is being conflated with a supposed Jan 2026 event. This drove a -6 ppt adjustment that was factually unfounded |
| Historical 10-day return statistics were requested but never computed | Medium | Research | The agentic search identified that BA 10-day rolling return stats were needed but admitted it could not compute them, leaving forecasters without the most directly relevant base rate data |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## Summary

- **Question ID:** 41991
- **Question Title:** Will BA's market close price on 2026-02-13 be higher than its market close price on 2026-02-03?
- **Question Type:** binary
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-02-03
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-02-13
- **Forecast Window:** 10 calendar days (~8 trading days)
- **Final Prediction:** 46.6%
- **Step 2 Predictions:** S2-1: 27%, S2-2: 54%, S2-3: 51%, S2-4: 55%, S2-5: 46%
- **Spread:** 28 percentage points (27% to 55%)
- **Total Cost:** $0.77
- **Duration:** 321 seconds (~5.4 minutes)
- **One-sentence quality assessment:** A significant data contamination issue -- multiple forecasters adopted a false $174.99 closing price from a confusing Investopedia article mixing 2024 and 2026 data -- undermined the inside view analysis, though the final aggregated prediction (46.6%) landed in a reasonable range largely due to cancellation of errors across the ensemble.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "Boeing stock February 2026 catalysts" (Google)
2. "Boeing news February 2026 developments" (Google News)
3. "Provide BA 10-day historical return stats for past five years and list any scheduled or probable catalysts between 3 Feb 2026 and 13 Feb 2026 affecting Boeing or aerospace sector." (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. "Boeing January 2026 aircraft deliveries" (Google)
2. "Boeing shares ahead of Senate safety hearing" (Google News)
3. "Latest Boeing updates and analyst price targets early February 2026" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Background and recent context (past 12 months + upcoming catalysts) | Very recent news (last 1-2 weeks) and immediate catalysts |
| Content type | Stock performance, operational stats, production plans, catalyst calendar | Delivery data, hearing news, analyst targets |
| Unique contribution | Catalyst mapping (Singapore Airshow, Factory Orders, FAA decisions); attempted base rate computation | Safety incident news (fuel switch), post-earnings reaction detail |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are reasonably discrete. Historical queries focused on background fundamentals and catalyst identification, while current queries targeted very recent developments. There is modest overlap (both probe "Boeing news" broadly) but each set surfaced different articles.
- Historical queries successfully targeted base rate establishment via the agentic search, though the agent could not complete the computation. The catalyst mapping was thorough and valuable.
- Current queries surfaced the critical fuel switch incident (via historical search, actually) and post-earnings price data. However, the AskNews query for current information returned zero Boeing-relevant results, which is a significant failure.
- Critical information gap: The AskNews search returned articles about BAX (Baxter), BAC (Bank of America), Indian markets, and cryptocurrency -- nothing about BA (Boeing). This appears to be a search relevance failure. Additionally, the Investopedia article returned in current search contained severely misleading data mixing 2024 and 2026 events.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remained largely factual and informational. The Seeking Alpha and TIKR.com articles contained analyst opinions and price targets (HOLD rating, $349 and $412 targets respectively), but these are properly labeled as opinions. The agent report explicitly noted it was providing a catalyst map, not a forecast. The current search analysis in `query_current.md` does contain mild directional language ("slightly asymmetric to the upside") but this is the query generator's framing, not research output itself. Overall, research appropriately informed rather than forecasted.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** Boeing Q4 earnings results and post-earnings price action; 2025 operational performance (600 deliveries, 1,173 orders); production ramp plans; Singapore Airshow timing; 787 fuel switch incident; analyst sentiment (HOLD ratings)
- **Critical information missed:** Actual BA closing price on Feb 3 (conflicting data between sources: $233.32 from earnings recap vs. $174.99 from Investopedia); real-time market sentiment; options market positioning; actual computed base rates for BA 10-day returns
- **Source quality:** Mixed. The Boeing-specific articles from Flight Global, CNBC, and the earnings call recap were high quality. The Investopedia article contained serious date inconsistencies that propagated errors through the pipeline. AskNews completely failed to return relevant Boeing content.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough and well-structured. Evaluated each source individually with quality ratings, distinguished facts from opinions, and correctly identified the earnings call as high quality and the Seeking Alpha analyst as non-institutional. Correctly flagged the fuel switch incident as breaking negative news with named expert opinions. Score: 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified five candidate classes and selected a composite "post-earnings drift + safety incident + industry event." While creative, composite reference classes are inherently harder to calibrate than single clean classes. Did not settle on a quantifiable base rate from any single class. Score: 2/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 10 calendar days / 7-8 trading days. Discussed post-earnings drift patterns, safety incident impact windows, and airshow timing. Provided reasonable historical pattern ranges (3-7 day safety impact, 5-10 day drift continuation). Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from a 52% neutral base and applied additive adjustments: -8% (post-earnings), -12% (safety), +5% (airshow), +2% (deliveries) = 39%. Then adjusted further to 34%. The arithmetic is transparent but the magnitudes of adjustments (especially -12% for safety) are not well-grounded in data. Score: 2/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 34% probability with explicit pathway analysis for both Yes and No outcomes.
- Considered both pathways but weighted bearish factors heavily. The -12% safety incident adjustment seems large given this was an isolated fuel switch issue, not a crash or grounding.
- The 34% prediction is the most bearish S1 output by a wide margin, driven primarily by heavy weighting of the safety incident.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation of all sources with quality ratings and relevance assessments. Correctly noted that most analyst opinions focused on multi-year timeframes, limiting their 10-day relevance. Identified the AskNews irrelevance. Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified four candidate classes (post-earnings drift, airshow periods, general 10-day, post-safety-news). Selected a composite. Similar weakness to S1-1 in that composite classes lack quantifiable base rates, but the individual classes were well-reasoned. Score: 2/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 10 calendar / ~8 trading days. Provided reasonable ranges for different patterns (post-earnings drift 5-10 days, airshow pops 2-4%). Identified all key events within the window. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 52% and applied: -5% (post-earnings), +7% (trade show), -4% (safety) = 50%. Then calibrated to 54% based on operational strength and airshow timing. The adjustments are more moderate and better balanced than S1-1, though the +7% for trade show seems optimistic. Score: 3/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 54% probability, considering both Yes and No pathways with a balanced analysis.
- Noted that the safety incident "appears contained" (one aircraft, no injuries), which is a fair assessment.
- The 54% prediction reflects a near-coin-flip with slight bullish tilt, which is reasonable for a 10-day stock prediction.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and efficient. Properly distinguished factual data from opinions for each source. Noted that TIKR valuation assumptions were aggressive (102.2x P/E exit). Correctly categorized source utility for the 10-day question as limited for long-horizon articles. Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three candidate classes and selected "BA's own historical distribution of 10-trading-day returns" as most suitable. This is the most rigorous choice among all forecasters. However, could not access actual computed statistics, so relied on general market knowledge that short-horizon returns are near-random with mild upward drift. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 8-9 trading days. Noted that "idiosyncratic volatility dominates" for BA, pushing up/down probability toward 50%. Correctly characterized post-earnings periods as potentially showing continuation or mean reversion. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchored on "slightly above 50%" based on equity drift, then adjusted to 52% accounting for BA-specific headline sensitivity. Clean, principled reasoning with explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty. Score: 3/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 52% probability -- the most disciplined and base-rate-anchored of all S1 outputs.
- Explicitly stated that mixed-sign catalysts should be treated as "roughly mean-zero on direction" in an outside view framework.
- The 52% reflects appropriate epistemic humility about short-term stock prediction.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient and accurate. Correctly identified that Seeking Alpha analyst is not sell-side, that TIKR valuation opinions are speculative, and that earnings call data is verifiable. Noted the fuel switch incident as "possible negative sentiment but no immediate financial impact." Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three classes and selected BA's own rolling 8-day windows (2016-2025) as most suitable. Claimed back-of-envelope estimates: mean 8-day return ~+0.35%, std dev ~6.5%, positive windows ~52%. These figures are plausible and the most specific quantitative base rate provided by any forecaster. Score: 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 8 trading days. Noted that short-horizon signal-to-noise is low and that "even large surprise events rarely move probability far from 50%." Addressed post-earnings drift (weak for Boeing, ~53% after positive, ~47% after negative) and checked for ex-dividend dates. Score: 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 52% historical hit rate, adjusted -1 ppt for modest negative news = 51%. Clean, principled, and appropriately conservative. Score: 3/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 51% probability with minimal adjustments from base rate.
- Clear articulation of why catalysts "cut both ways and broadly net to zero in an outside-view framework."
- The 51% is the most restrained and base-rate-faithful prediction.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Similar to S1-4 in style and quality. Correctly classified sources and separated facts from opinions. Noted that narrative opinions are "ignored unless from identifiable experts." Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same three-class structure as S1-4, selecting BA's own 8-day windows. Cited approximate values: mean ~+0.35%, std dev ~6.5%, positive windows ~52%. These match S1-4's figures (expected, as both are o3). Score: 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 8 trading days. Noted post-earnings drift is "weak and inconsistent for Boeing over 10-day windows" (~53% after positive, ~47% after negative). Checked ex-dividend date. Thorough. Score: 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 52%, adjusted -1 ppt for low-probability negative news (fuel switch) = 51%. Nearly identical to S1-4. Score: 3/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Derived 51% probability, essentially identical to S1-4.
- Both o3 instances converged on the same prediction and reasoning, showing strong model consistency but limited diversity.
- Well-calibrated and principled.

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 34% | 11/16 | Thorough source analysis with quality ratings | Over-weighted safety incident (-12% adjustment) without strong empirical basis |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 54% | 11/16 | Balanced consideration of competing catalysts | Composite reference class lacks quantifiable base rate; +7% airshow adjustment seems high |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 52% | 12/16 | Disciplined base-rate anchoring; appropriate epistemic humility | Did not provide specific quantitative base rates |
| S1-4 | o3 | 53% | 14/16 | Specific quantitative base rates; principled minimal adjustment | Nearly identical to S1-5 (limited diversity from same model) |
| S1-5 | o3 | 51% | 14/16 | Rigorous reference class selection; careful adjustment | Nearly identical to S1-4 (limited diversity from same model) |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Prediction |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5, self-model) | 34% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 53% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 54% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 52% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3, self-model) | 51% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applied Strong/Moderate/Weak framework but catastrophically misidentified evidence. Classified "BA Feb 3 closing price = $174.99" as Strong evidence and "Stock down ~33% YTD 2026" as Strong evidence. Both of these data points come from an Investopedia article with severe date inconsistencies (mixing 2024 events into a 2026 article). The actual BA close was approximately $233, not $175. This is a critical factual error that dominated the entire analysis. Score: 1/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 34% -> Output: 27%, Delta = -7 ppt). The update direction was further bearish, driven entirely by the false $174.99 price and fictitious -33% YTD decline. Without these errors, the evidence actually pointed to a more balanced or slightly bullish update. The update direction contradicts what the evidence would have shown with correct data. Score: 1/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved (25-30%) and doubled (45-50%) scenarios. The reasoning is internally consistent with its (incorrect) premises but the absolute levels are wrong due to the factual error. Score: 2/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all elements but the paraphrase uses the wrong price ($174.99). Base rate stated (50% adjusted to 27%). Consistency check performed. Top evidence listed (though based on false data). Blind spot identified (major order win). Status quo assessment reasonable given incorrect premises. Score: 2/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The update from 34% to 27% moved further bearish, which is inconsistent with the balance of actual evidence. The inside view sources (Flight Global production targets, CNBC orders data) were mildly bullish, yet the forecast moved down.
- The final 27% probability is clearly an outlier driven by factual contamination, not sound analysis.

- **Score:** 6/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applied the framework competently. Identified production momentum (Flight Global, DIGITIMES) as strong, 2025 delivery success as moderate, negative momentum as moderate. Correctly noted the 33% YTD decline could indicate either oversold conditions or continued weakness. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 53% -> Output: 54%, Delta = +1 ppt). Very modest upward adjustment. Justified by oversold mean-reversion potential offsetting lack of immediate catalysts. The direction (slightly upward from an already moderate base) is reasonable. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved (51-52%) and doubled (55-57%) scenarios. The reasoning is sensible -- shorter windows increase randomness, longer windows allow mean reversion. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all elements. Paraphrase uses $174.99 (same error as S2-1 from the Investopedia source), but the forecast itself was not heavily distorted by this. Base rate stated (53%). Consistency check done. Top evidence listed. Blind spot identified (unexpected catalyst). Status quo reasoning provided. Score: 3/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The update direction (+1 ppt) matches the evidence direction: inside view sources were mildly positive (production ramp, deliveries), while negative factors were largely priced in.
- The final 54% is internally consistent with stated reasoning. The modest update from the o3 outside view (53%) shows appropriate calibration for weak new evidence.
- Note: S2-2 also references the $174.99 figure from Investopedia but did not let it dominate the analysis the way S2-1 did.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Used Strong/Moderate/Weak classification effectively. Identified the Feb 3 negative headline and price action as strong evidence (downward). Production/delivery momentum as moderate (upward). FAA approval gating as moderate (downward). Historical hearing pieces as weak. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 54% -> Output: 51%, Delta = -3 ppt). Adjusted downward from S1-2's outside view based on: ongoing safety/whistleblower scrutiny (-3 to -5 pts), operational momentum floor (+1 to +2 pts). Net -3 pts is well-justified. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved (more "No" due to negative momentum persistence) and doubled (more "Yes" due to mean reversion). Reasoning is clear and directionally correct. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all elements. Paraphrase correct (resolves Yes if Feb 13 close > Feb 3 close). Base rate stated (54%). Consistency check: "51 out of 100 times." Top evidence listed. Blind spot identified (new safety incident or large order). Status quo assessment: near 50/50 with slight negative nudge. Score: 4/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The update direction (slightly bearish) matches evidence: the Feb 3 negative price action and hearing headlines support a modest downward adjustment.
- The 51% final probability is internally consistent with "near-coinflip" reasoning and appropriately modest in its adjustment from the outside view.
- Importantly, S2-3 acknowledged the date inconsistency in the Investopedia article but did not let it dominate the analysis.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear and well-structured. Positive moderate: post-sell-off mean reversion, Singapore Airshow. Negative moderate: grounding/FAA scrutiny, whistleblower headlines. Neutral: general market drift. Correctly notes positives and negatives are "roughly balanced." Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 52% -> Output: 55%, Delta = +3 ppt). Adjusted upward: +2 ppt for post-sell-off mean reversion, +2 ppt for airshow potential, -1 ppt for headline/FAA risk = net +3 ppt. The direction (slightly bullish) is justified by the mean-reversion argument after a large decline. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved (~52%, closer to drift) and doubled (~51%, more random). This is an unusual pattern -- longer horizon slightly less favorable -- but the reasoning that "more macro & FAA decisions feed in" adding variance is defensible. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all elements. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated (52%). Consistency: "55 of 100 times." Key evidence listed. Blind spot: "unexpected FAA mandate extends MAX grounding." Status quo: symmetric volatility, small nudge. Score: 3/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The update direction (bullish) is reasonable given the mean-reversion thesis and Singapore Airshow catalyst.
- However, S2-4 references a "737 MAX grounding" and "FAA scrutiny" from "fresh adverse finding" context. While there was safety news (the 787 fuel switch), there was no 737 MAX grounding in 2026 mentioned in the sources. This conflation is a moderate factual error. The -1 ppt adjustment for this is small so the impact is limited.
- Final 55% is the most bullish S2 output but within a reasonable range.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applied the framework but incorporated a critical factual error. Lists "FAA grounding of 737 MAX fleet after 5 Jan 2026 door-plug blow-out" as strong negative evidence. No such event is described in any provided source. The January 2024 Alaska Airlines door plug incident is being conflated with a supposed January 2026 event. This is a hallucination or severe temporal confusion. Score: 2/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 51% -> Output: 46%, Delta = -5 ppt). Adjusted -6 ppt for "persistent regulatory overhang from full-fleet grounding" and -3 ppt for "senate whistleblower revelations," offset by +2 ppt mean reversion. The -6 ppt adjustment is based on the hallucinated grounding event, making the direction and magnitude questionable. Score: 2/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved (closer to 50%) and doubled (regression to mean). Brief but adequate. Score: 2/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all elements. Base rate stated (52%). Consistency: "46 out of 100 times." Key evidence includes the hallucinated grounding (a). Blind spot: "FAA unexpectedly lifts grounding before 13 Feb" -- this references the same hallucinated event. Score: 2/4

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The update direction (bearish, -5 ppt) is partially based on a hallucinated event (737 MAX grounding in Jan 2026). Without this error, the adjustment would likely be closer to -2 ppt (just the Senate hearing effect + mild safety news), yielding ~49% rather than 46%.
- The 46% is more bearish than it should be given the actual evidence, but not as severely distorted as S2-1's 27%.

- **Score:** 8/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 34% (S1-1) | 27% | -7 ppt | 6/16 | No -- driven by factually incorrect price data ($174.99) and fictitious -33% YTD decline |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 53% (S1-4) | 54% | +1 ppt | 12/16 | Yes -- modest upward adjustment from mean-reversion thesis, appropriately small |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 54% (S1-2) | 51% | -3 ppt | 13/16 | Yes -- slight bearish adjustment from Feb 3 negative price action and safety headlines |
| S2-4 | o3 | 52% (S1-3) | 55% | +3 ppt | 12/16 | Partial -- direction justified by mean reversion and airshow, but references unclear "grounding" |
| S2-5 | o3 | 51% (S1-5) | 46% | -5 ppt | 8/16 | No -- hallucinated 737 MAX grounding in Jan 2026 drove the dominant negative adjustment |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5, received S1-4 from o3):** This was the most effective cross-pollination instance. S2-2 received a disciplined, base-rate-anchored 53% from o3 and used it as a solid foundation. The modest +1 ppt adjustment shows the Sonnet 4.5 model was appropriately anchored by the o3 outside view rather than drifting toward its same-model peer S1-1's extreme 34%. This cross-pollination clearly improved output quality.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2, received S1-2 from Sonnet 4.5):** Effective cross-pollination. S2-3 received a 54% from Sonnet 4.5 and made a principled -3 ppt adjustment based on new evidence, landing at 51%. The GPT-5.2 model engaged meaningfully with the Sonnet 4.5 base rate without simply rubber-stamping it.

- **S2-4 (o3, received S1-3 from GPT-5.2):** Moderately effective. S2-4 received a 52% from GPT-5.2 and adjusted upward to 55%. The o3 model added mean-reversion and airshow catalyst reasoning that the GPT-5.2 outside view had deliberately excluded. This represents genuine analytical addition, though the +3 ppt feels slightly large given the weak evidence.

- **S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5, received S1-1 from self):** Same-model instance performed poorly. Rather than providing a moderating influence, the self-pollination reinforced S1-1's already-bearish 34% view and pushed it further to 27%, compounded by the factual price error. The lack of cross-model input allowed errors to cascade.

- **S2-5 (o3, received S1-5 from self):** Same-model instance introduced new errors. Despite receiving a disciplined 51% from its own outside view, S2-5 hallucinated a "737 MAX fleet grounding" event and pushed the prediction down to 46%. Self-pollination failed to prevent error introduction.

**Summary:** Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) outperformed same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) in this forecast. Cross-pollination increased diversity (S2-2 landed at 54% rather than following S1-1's 34% trajectory) and maintained analytical quality. Same-model instances either amplified errors (S2-1) or introduced new ones (S2-5). Cross-pollination was effective overall.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: BA's close on Feb 13, 2026 must be strictly higher than close on Feb 3, 2026.
- All correctly identified the forecast timeframe as ~8 trading days (10 calendar days).
- **Critical issue with current status:** Multiple forecasters (S2-1, S2-2, S2-5) referenced BA closing at $174.99 on Feb 3, 2026. The question description states BA's last close as of Feb 1 was $233.72, and the earnings call summary (in historical research) puts it at $233.32 on Feb 3. The $174.99 figure comes from an Investopedia article with clear date inconsistencies (describing 2024 events as if they occurred in 2026). The correct close was approximately $233, making the "$174.99" and "-33% YTD" claims false.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Boeing delivered 600 commercial aircraft in 2025, the most since 2018
2. Boeing secured over 1,100 net commercial orders in 2025
3. The Singapore Airshow was scheduled for early February 2026, providing a potential positive catalyst
4. Boeing's Q4 2025 earnings beat revenue and profit expectations
5. A 787 fuel control switch incident occurred on Feb 1, 2026 involving an Air India aircraft

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-1 | BA close price on Feb 3 cited as $174.99 instead of ~$233 | Adopted misleading Investopedia data that appears to be from 2024 redated to 2026 | Critical -- drove prediction 20+ ppts below where it would otherwise be |
| S2-1 | BA "down 33% YTD" in 2026 | No evidence supports this; appears to stem from same misleading article | Critical -- primary driver of extreme bearish adjustment |
| S2-5 | "FAA grounding of 737 MAX fleet after 5 Jan 2026 door-plug blow-out" | No such event occurred in 2026; this conflates the January 2024 Alaska Airlines incident | High -- drove -6 ppt adjustment based on non-existent event |
| S2-4 | References "737 MAX grounding" and "FAA scrutiny" in ambiguous terms | While less explicit than S2-5, the language implies an active grounding that is not supported by sources | Medium -- only affected a -1 ppt adjustment |
| S2-2 | Also cites $174.99 close in paraphrase | Same Investopedia error, but S2-2 did not let it dominate the analysis | Low -- forecast quality was not significantly affected |

### Hallucinations

S2-5 hallucinated (or severely conflated) a "737 MAX fleet grounding after 5 Jan 2026 door-plug blow-out." No such event is described in any of the provided sources. The January 5, 2024 Alaska Airlines door plug incident and subsequent grounding are well-documented historical events, but these occurred two years before the forecast date. The forecaster appears to have transplanted this 2024 event into 2026, which constitutes either a hallucination or a severe temporal confusion. This error directly affected the probability derivation with a -6 ppt adjustment.

The Investopedia article itself may be the root cause of confusion, as it describes 2024 events (Dave Calhoun as CEO, door plug incident) while being dated February 3, 2026. The research pipeline failed to flag this article as unreliable despite its obvious inconsistencies.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong outside view analysis by o3 instances (S1-4, S1-5):** Both provided rigorous, quantitative base rates grounded in Boeing's actual historical 8-day return distribution, with principled minimal adjustments. These were the highest-scoring S1 outputs at 14/16.
2. **Effective cross-pollination for S2-2 and S2-3:** Cross-model instances produced well-calibrated inside view updates that engaged meaningfully with their received outside views while incorporating new evidence. S2-3 was the highest-scoring S2 output at 13/16.
3. **Comprehensive catalyst mapping:** The agentic search produced a detailed and valuable mapping of scheduled and probable events during the 10-day window (Singapore Airshow, delivery data release, Factory Orders, FAA decisions), giving forecasters solid material to work with.

### Weaknesses
1. **Critical data contamination from misleading Investopedia article:** A single article with severe date inconsistencies (mixing 2024 events into a 2026-dated piece) introduced a false closing price ($174.99 vs. ~$233) and fictitious -33% YTD decline. This propagated through multiple forecasters and was the primary driver of S2-1's extreme 27% outlier.
2. **AskNews search failure:** The AskNews current search returned zero Boeing-relevant articles, with all results about unrelated tickers (BAX, BAC, etc.). This left forecasters without a key current-news source for the inside view.
3. **Hallucination in S2-5:** The o3 model fabricated a "737 MAX fleet grounding after 5 Jan 2026 door-plug blow-out" that does not exist in any provided source, introducing a -6 ppt erroneous adjustment. The research pipeline had no mechanism to catch or prevent such factual errors at the forecaster level.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: C**

Justification: The forecast has notable strengths (excellent o3 outside views, effective cross-pollination, comprehensive catalyst research) but is significantly undermined by critical factual errors in the inside view stage. The misleading Investopedia article caused one forecaster (S2-1) to produce a 27% prediction based on false data, and another (S2-5) hallucinated a 2026 grounding event. The final aggregated prediction of 46.6% happens to be in a defensible range (close to the base rate of ~52% minus modest bearish adjustments), but this is partly due to error cancellation across the ensemble rather than uniformly sound reasoning. The grade reflects that the core methodology worked (the ensemble averaged out extreme errors) but individual forecaster quality was inconsistent, with two of five inside views containing significant factual problems.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Source validation layer:** Implement a cross-checking mechanism that flags articles with internal date inconsistencies (e.g., an article dated 2026 that references Dave Calhoun as current CEO, when he retired in 2024). Articles with >N date/fact inconsistencies should be excluded or flagged as unreliable.
2. **AskNews query refinement:** The ticker "BA" may be too short/ambiguous for AskNews. Consider using full company name "Boeing" in addition to or instead of the ticker symbol. Also consider filtering by sector or adding context like "Boeing BA stock" to improve relevance.
3. **Price verification:** For stock-price questions, add a dedicated step that queries Yahoo Finance or another authoritative API directly for the actual closing price, rather than relying on news articles that may contain stale or incorrect data.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Fact-checking between stages:** Add a lightweight validation step between outside and inside views that verifies key factual claims (especially price data) across multiple sources before passing them to the inside view stage.
2. **Source reliability scoring in prompts:** The inside view prompt could explicitly instruct forecasters to "verify key numerical claims against multiple sources and flag any data points that only appear in a single source or that conflict with other sources."
3. **Hallucination guardrails:** Add explicit instruction in the inside view prompt: "Only reference events and facts that are directly supported by the provided sources. Do not reference events from memory that are not in the source materials."

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5:** S2-1 was too credulous with the misleading Investopedia article, accepting the $174.99 price without cross-referencing against the $233.32 figure clearly stated in the historical research. S2-2 handled the same data much better, suggesting the issue is sensitivity to which outside view is received rather than an inherent model weakness. Consider whether the self-pollination path (S2-1 receives S1-1) creates an "echo chamber" that amplifies errors.
- **GPT-5.2 (S1-3/S2-3):** Strong performance across both stages. The most balanced and well-calibrated forecaster in this ensemble. Handled the Investopedia data inconsistency well by noting it but not letting it dominate. No specific improvements needed.
- **o3 (S1-4/S1-5, S2-4/S2-5):** Excellent outside view performance but mixed inside view results. S2-4 performed well but S2-5 hallucinated a non-existent grounding event. The o3 model may benefit from stronger grounding instructions that require explicit source citations for each factual claim.
