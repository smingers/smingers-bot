## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agentic search failed to retrieve Metaculus Q41144 time-series data | High | Research | The agentic search spent significant effort trying to scrape the target Metaculus question externally, failing entirely. The question description already provided the baseline (31.00% as of 2026-02-01), yet this was underutilized by some forecasters who treated the baseline as unknown. |
| Irrelevant sources included in research | Medium | Research | An Al Jazeera article about Ukraine-Russia talks and multiple articles about South Sudan (a different country/conflict) were included in the research corpus, diluting relevant signal. |
| Inconsistent treatment of the known baseline (31%) | Medium | S1-1 through S1-5 | The question description explicitly states the community prediction was 31.00% as of 2026-02-01. Some forecasters (S1-4, S1-5) correctly noted this was available in the question prompt, while others (S1-1, S1-2) treated the current Metaculus value as entirely unknown, creating unnecessary uncertainty. |
| Forecaster 4 outside view applies a Metaculus-Manifold offset of +4pp without strong evidence | Medium | S1-4 | Claims "median offset across 20 recent war-related questions is +4 pp vs Manifold" -- this specific statistic appears fabricated. No source in the research supports this claim. |
| Overly large inside view adjustments by S2-1 | Medium | S2-1 | Applied a -25pp adjustment from outside view (45% to 20%), which seems excessive given that the new information (al-Burhan quote) is a restatement of a known position, not a fundamentally new development. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "Metaculus Sudan ceasefire 2026 probability" (Google)
2. "Sudan ceasefire negotiations 2026 February" (Google News)
3. "Retrieve full time-series data for Metaculus question 41144; list major probability moves since 2025-12-01 with associated news headlines; summarize trend in last two weeks." (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. "Sudan ceasefire negotiations 2026 February" (Google)
2. "Sudan peace talks early 2026" (Google News)
3. "Latest reports on Sudan ceasefire talks February 2026" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Background context and prediction market data | Breaking news from Jan-Feb 2026 |
| Content type | Market prices, diplomatic context, Metaculus data retrieval | News articles, expert analysis, battlefield updates |
| Unique contribution | Prediction market anchors (Polymarket, Manifold) | Al-Burhan ceasefire rejection quote, Kadugli siege, Quad Initiative status |

**Analysis:**

The query sets are moderately overlapping. Query 2 in both the historical and current sets is nearly identical ("Sudan ceasefire negotiations 2026 February"), which wastes a search slot. The historical queries were reasonably designed: the Metaculus-specific Google query successfully surfaced Polymarket and Manifold market data, and the Google News query found diplomatic reporting. However, the agent query was poorly conceived -- it attempted to scrape Metaculus API data externally for a question that is likely tournament-restricted, consuming significant cost ($0.106) and returning no useful data.

The current queries were effective. The AskNews query surfaced 17 results including the critical AFP reporting on al-Burhan's ceasefire rejection and the Kadugli siege breaking. The Google and Google News queries produced relevant diplomatic context from Africanews, Brookings, Al Jazeera, and CFR.

A critical gap: no query targeted historical Metaculus community prediction behavior on similar "cp_rises" meta-questions, which would have been the ideal reference class for this type of meta-prediction. The question is fundamentally about whether a community prediction will drift above a threshold, and research about prediction platform dynamics would have been more valuable than yet another Sudan conflict update.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs appropriately remain factual and descriptive. The prediction market data (Polymarket 12%/32%/58%, Manifold 30%) is presented as crowd sentiment data rather than as probability estimates. Article summaries focus on diplomatic and military developments without editorializing probability judgments. The article summarizer correctly labeled opinion content as such (e.g., the Al Jazeera op-ed by the Governor of Darfur). This is a strength.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Prediction market prices from Polymarket and Manifold as anchoring data
  - Al-Burhan's Feb 3 explicit ceasefire rejection ("no truce, no ceasefire so long as the RSF occupies cities")
  - SAF breaking the Kadugli siege with immediate RSF drone retaliation (Feb 3)
  - US-Sudan intelligence meetings in January deliberately excluded ceasefire discussions
  - Quad Initiative diplomatic activity without concrete results
  - RSF drone strike killing 8 civilians including 3 children on same day
  - Historical pattern of failed ceasefire proposals (Nov 2025 proposal unanswered)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - The question description itself states the community prediction was 31.00% as of 2026-02-01, but the agentic search wasted effort trying to find this externally
  - No research on Metaculus community prediction volatility patterns for meta-questions
  - No research on how "cp_rises" format questions historically resolve on Metaculus
  - No data on how Metaculus community predictions differ from Manifold/Polymarket on similar questions (claimed by some forecasters but not sourced)

- **Source quality:** Generally high. AFP wire reporting, UN News, CFR and Brookings think tanks, and prediction market data are all credible. However, two articles about South Sudan (a different conflict) and one about Ukraine-Russia talks were irrelevant, diluting the signal.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough and well-structured. Correctly identified the Polymarket, Manifold, Media Line, AllAfrica, and agent report sources. Properly noted the Al Jazeera Ukraine article as irrelevant. Correctly distinguished fact from opinion in each source. Quality ratings were appropriate (e.g., Polymarket as "moderate," AllAfrica as "high"). Score: 4/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three plausible reference classes: (1) prediction market accuracy for ceasefire predictions, (2) historical Metaculus community prediction stability over 11-day periods, and (3) ceasefire likelihood in African civil wars. Correctly chose a combination of #1 and #2 as most suitable. However, the analysis of reference class #2 was speculative ("typically move 5-15 percentage points") without cited evidence. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified the 11-day window. Provided reasonable estimates of typical drift (3-8pp normally, 15-25pp for breakthroughs) but without sourced evidence for these ranges. Noted the absence of imminent breakthroughs. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Concluded 45% probability by reasoning through factors supporting/opposing >31%. The derivation is qualitative rather than mathematical. The logic is sound: markets cluster near 31%, creating near-coinflip conditions with slight downward bias from negative news. However, did not recognize that the question description itself states the current community prediction is 31.00%. Score: 2/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Derived 45% probability. Considered both Yes (>31%) and No (<=31%) pathways.
- The probability reflects genuine uncertainty about which side of a tight threshold the prediction will land on.
- The critical unknown (current baseline) was correctly identified but could have been partially resolved from the question description.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive and well-organized. Similar coverage to S1-1. Correctly identified Cameron Hudson and Hamid Khalafallah as named expert sources. Properly noted Manifold's 201 traders as giving "decent crowd wisdom aggregation." Score: 4/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified four reference classes. The "status quo baseline" class (#4) was a creative addition specific to meta-prediction. Correctly chose prediction market probabilities as the most suitable proxy. However, like S1-1, treated the Metaculus baseline as unknown when it was stated in the question description. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 11-day window. Provided detailed analysis of how near-term vs. longer-term market probabilities (Polymarket 12% by March vs. 32% by June) suggest low near-term optimism. Noted predictions tend to be "sticky" in short windows. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derived 38% probability. The reasoning is more conservative than S1-1 and better justified: Manifold at 30% is below threshold, Polymarket's near-term 12% suggests pessimism, and recent negative news (ceasefire excluded from US talks) tilts downward. The conclusion is mathematically coherent. Score: 3/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Derived 38%. Considered both pathways with clear enumeration of factors.
- The asymmetry in the argument (more factors supporting <=31%) is properly reflected in the sub-50% prediction.
- Noted the question setter likely chose 31% to create a roughly 50-50 proposition, which is an insightful observation.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent structure. Uniquely noted that Polymarket's criteria are stricter than Metaculus (formal agreement only, no 30-day clause), which makes Polymarket prices a lower bound for Metaculus-style resolution. This is an important analytical insight that other forecasters missed. Correctly rated Manifold as the closest proxy. Score: 4/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Identified three classes and correctly ranked Manifold-as-proxy as #1 and Polymarket as #2. The reasoning that Polymarket's stricter definition creates a lower bound is analytically sound. Noted the generic civil-war base rate is low-suitability for the meta-prediction question. Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 11-day window. Noted that absent a major breakthrough, community probabilities "drift modestly" over two weeks. The key insight -- that the question reduces to whether the current hidden Metaculus value is above or below 31% -- is correct and well-articulated. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derived 47%. Used a clear analytical framework: Manifold at 30%, assumed Metaculus value centered near 30-32% with modest dispersion, probability of >31% near 45-55%, with slight downward tilt. The reasoning is transparent and mathematically coherent, though somewhat hand-wavy in the probabilistic treatment. Score: 3/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Derived 47%. The near-50% prediction reflects appropriate uncertainty for a threshold question where the proxy is within 1pp of the threshold.
- The distinction between Polymarket's stricter definition and Metaculus's broader definition is a valuable analytical contribution.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but complete. Correctly identified all relevant sources and their limitations. The characterization of the AllAfrica piece as "mildly bearish" is apt. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three candidate classes and made a sophisticated choice: class 2 (cross-platform markets) for level anchor plus class 3 (Metaculus drift statistics) for short-term volatility. Provided specific quantitative estimates: "inter-decile weekly change ~3pp; >10pp moves occur ~15% of the time." These numbers appear plausible but are not sourced. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 11-day window. Provided specific volatility estimates (sigma ~3pp, big surprises >10pp rare). The quantitative treatment is more rigorous than other forecasters. Score: 4/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Most mathematically rigorous of all five. Applied a formal probabilistic model: inferred Metaculus value ~34% (Manifold + 4pp offset), calculated Pr(p>31 | N(34, 10^2)) ~ 60%, then added drift model (sigma 3pp), yielding 0.60*0.88 + 0.40*0.12 = 0.60, minus 4pp for bearish news = 56%. However, the +4pp Metaculus-Manifold offset claim ("median offset across 20 recent war-related questions") appears fabricated -- no source in the research supports this. This inflates the estimate. Score: 3/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Derived 56%. The formal probabilistic framework is commendable, but the +4pp offset assumption is unsupported and drives the estimate above 50%.
- The error bar (90% CI: 36-76%) shows appropriate uncertainty.
- If the +4pp offset is removed, the estimate would be ~44%, much closer to the ensemble.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and efficient. Similar coverage to S1-4. Correctly noted historical Metaculus-Manifold correlation (~0.8). Provided useful characterization: "Mid-range probabilities (20-40%) dominate early life" for civil-war ceasefire questions. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong. Used the same class structure as S1-4 but with a different directional assumption: "Metaculus tends to be 0-4 ppts lower than Manifold for the same cease-fire topics." This contradicts S1-4's claim of Metaculus being +4pp higher. The claim that Metaculus users "reward caution and penalise back-sliding clauses" is plausible but unsourced. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 11-day window. Provided detailed volatility estimates: "two-week volatility: median absolute move 1.8 ppts; 90th-percentile 5.0 ppts" based on historical reference class (n~12). These specific numbers give the analysis rigor. Score: 4/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derived 33%. The most conservative outside view of the five. Applied a formal probabilistic framework: assumed Metaculus ~29% (Manifold 30% minus 1pp bias), modeled with N(29, 2.2^2) for drift, yielding Pr(>31) ~23%, then added hyper-uncertainty with N(29, 3^2) prior to get ~36%. The formal treatment is excellent, though the assumption that Metaculus runs below Manifold directly contradicts S1-4's opposite claim. Score: 3/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Derived 33%. The most bearish outside view, reflecting the assumed Metaculus-below-Manifold bias.
- The formal statistical treatment (drift model + hyper-uncertainty integration) is the most rigorous approach.
- The key vulnerability is the direction of the Metaculus-Manifold offset, which directly drives whether the estimate is above or below 50%.

- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 45% | 12/16 | Clear enumeration of factors for/against | Treated baseline as unknown despite it being in question text; qualitative rather than quantitative derivation |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 38% | 13/16 | Insightful observation about threshold placement near market consensus | Treated baseline as unknown; reference class analysis could be more rigorous |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 47% | 14/16 | Excellent insight that Polymarket's stricter definition creates a lower bound for Metaculus | Probabilistic treatment somewhat hand-wavy despite good framing |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Prediction |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5, self) | 45% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 56% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 38% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 47% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3, self) | 33% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applied a structured Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly classified al-Burhan's ceasefire rejection and concurrent military operations as strong evidence (downward), the Quad diplomatic initiative as moderate (slight upward), and market consensus as weak. However, the itemized point deductions (-15pp for al-Burhan, -10pp for escalation, -5pp for failed Nov proposal, +5pp for diplomacy = -25pp total) are arguably too aggressive for what amounts to a restatement of a known negotiating position. Score: 2/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 45% -> Output: 25%, Delta = -20pp. The direction is correct (negative news should decrease probability), but the magnitude is extreme. Al-Burhan's "no ceasefire" statement is a reiteration of his known stance, not a new development -- the SAF had already failed to respond to the Nov 2025 proposal. A -20pp shift implies this news is nearly as informative as a ceasefire actually being signed would be in the other direction. Score: 2/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved and doubled windows with reasonable directional analysis. If halved, prediction depends more on current baseline; if doubled, more variance. Noted the negative news was "very recent" (Feb 3). Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all six elements: paraphrase (correct), base rate (stated), consistency check ("25 out of 100" articulated), top evidence (4 items listed), blind spot (diplomatic breakthrough at ~15% embedded), status quo (military escalation trajectory). Score: 4/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction matches evidence direction (negative news -> decrease in probability of >31%).
- Final probability (25%) is internally consistent with reasoning that community likely drops to 25-30% range.
- However, the reasoning double-counts some evidence (al-Burhan's statement and the failed Nov proposal are closely related).

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applied Strong/Moderate/Weak framework effectively. Correctly identified al-Burhan's rejection as the strongest signal. The impact estimates (-8 to -12pp for al-Burhan, -3 to -5pp for violence, -2 to -3pp for no Quad response, +2 to +3pp for active diplomacy) are more measured than S2-1's. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 56% -> Output: 38%, Delta = -18pp. The starting point (56%) was the highest outside view, and the update brought it back toward the ensemble center. The net adjustment of -11 to -17pp from the baseline 34% (inferred Metaculus level) to 17-23% is a reasonable estimate of the current Metaculus value given recent news. However, the final 38% represents an intermediate position that shows self-correction: initially derived 25% then adjusted upward to 38% for overconfidence, which is a thoughtful meta-cognitive step. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved and doubled windows. If doubled (22 days), noted UK UNSC meeting on Feb 19 could produce new proposals, increasing probability ~5pp. If halved, negative news dominates, decreasing ~5pp. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed meaningfully. The blind spot identification (UK UNSC meeting on Feb 19 is after resolution date) is a particularly sharp observation. The self-correction for overconfidence ("Adjustment for overconfidence: perhaps Metaculus forecasters weight al-Burhan's rhetoric less heavily than I do") shows good epistemic humility. Score: 4/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction matches evidence. The self-correction from initial 25% to final 38% demonstrates awareness that the inside view can over-anchor on recent salient events.
- The final 38% is internally consistent with reasoning that the Metaculus community is likely near 30% and could be on either side of 31%.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly identified the al-Burhan quote as the highest-signal datapoint. The "Net evidential pull vs outside view: modest downward pressure" characterization is appropriately calibrated -- it avoids the over-reaction seen in S2-1. Score: 4/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 38% -> Output: 33%, Delta = -5pp. The adjustment is conservative and well-reasoned: the outside view was already below 50%, and the inside view applies a modest further reduction based on the al-Burhan statement and continued fighting. The reasoning that "community tends to anchor to 'long war' base rates" and that predictions are "sticky over 11 days" supports the small magnitude. Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved and doubled windows. If halved (~5-6 days), "even more stickiness -> probability would drop slightly." If doubled (~22 days), "more chance for a headline diplomatic development -> probability would rise modestly." Clear and quantitative. Score: 4/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed. Consistency check ("33 out of 100 times") articulated. The +-10% sensitivity analysis is a nice addition, explaining what would need to be true at 43% vs 23%. Score: 4/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The -5pp update is well-calibrated: negative news warrants a downward shift, but the news is largely a confirmation of the status quo rather than a dramatic new development.
- Final 33% is internally consistent: slightly below the threshold (suggesting community likely sits at or just below 31%).

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but effective. Correctly categorized strong (Burhan veto, pattern of failed proposals), moderate (Cairo mechanism, Manifold near threshold), and weak (Olympic truce, IMF scenarios) evidence. The categorization is sound and efficient. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 47% -> Output: 33%, Delta = -14pp. The reasoning is rigorous: modeled unknown Metaculus number as N(30%, sigma 3%), computed P(>31) = 37%, then adjusted for slight downward drift expected (continued violence, SAF rejection) to 32%, added 1pp for cross-platform uncertainty = 33%. The mathematical framework is clean and transparent. Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved and doubled windows concisely. "Halving the window to 5-6 days would reduce expected drift further (prob down ~2pp). Doubling to three weeks would increase room for a diplomatic surprise, raising tail risk of >31% by ~3pp." Specific quantitative estimates. Score: 4/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements present. The blind spot ("sudden jointly-announced 30-day humanitarian pause") is the most specific and realistic of all five forecasters. Status quo bias acknowledged. Score: 3/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The -14pp update direction is correct and well-calibrated given the starting point (47%) was moderately high.
- Final 33% is consistent with the formal statistical model presented.
- The convergence with S2-3 and S2-5 around 30-33% suggests a robust consensus.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong evidence categorization. Correctly identified historical Metaculus two-week volatility (~3pp) and proxy market clustering (30-32%) as strong evidence. Classified Burhan's statement as moderate (not strong), which is a defensible but slightly unusual ranking -- most other forecasters rated it strong. The reasoning that forecasters have "repeatedly discounted such talk in 2024-25" suggests the Burhan quote is less novel than it appears. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 33% -> Output: 30%, Delta = -3pp. The smallest adjustment of all five, reflecting that the outside view was already quite bearish. Applied specific downward adjustments: -2% for salient negative news, -1% for no corroborating positive surprise, -1% for Metaculus bias vs. Manifold. Expected Metaculus level today ~28%, with drift sigma 2.2pp yields P(>31) ~18%, plus mean uncertainty pushes to ~30%. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved and doubled windows with specific quantitative estimates. "If the window were halved (approx 5 days) sigma of drift would shrink to ~1.5 ppts and the chance of clearing 31% would drop ~3 ppts. If doubled (approx 22 days) sigma ~3 ppts, raising tail risk by ~4 ppts." Score: 4/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed. Consistency check articulated clearly. Key evidence listed with four specific items. Blind spot identified (leaked draft SAF-RSF humanitarian pact). Status quo acknowledged. Score: 3/4.

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The -3pp update from 33% to 30% is the most conservative shift, reflecting that the outside view had already incorporated much of the relevant information.
- The formal statistical treatment (expected Metaculus ~28%, drift model, mean uncertainty integration) is rigorous and transparent.
- Final 30% represents the most bearish view in the ensemble.

- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 45% (S1-1) | 25% | -20pp | 11/16 | Partial -- direction correct, magnitude excessive |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 56% (S1-4) | 38% | -18pp | 13/16 | Yes -- large starting point warranted large correction; self-corrected for overconfidence |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 38% (S1-2) | 33% | -5pp | 16/16 | Yes -- appropriate magnitude for confirmatory negative evidence |
| S2-4 | o3 | 47% (S1-3) | 33% | -14pp | 14/16 | Yes -- formal statistical model justifies shift |
| S2-5 | o3 | 33% (S1-5) | 30% | -3pp | 13/16 | Yes -- small update from already-conservative base |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Cross-model instances (S2-2 received S1-4, S2-3 received S1-2, S2-4 received S1-3):**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3's S1-4 at 56%):** Engaged meaningfully with the inherited outside view. Explicitly referenced the "inferred current Metaculus value of ~34%" from S1-4 and then systematically downgraded it. The cross-pollination was productive -- it forced S2-2 to grapple with a higher starting point and explain why current evidence warrants a large downward correction. This created a useful intermediate position (38%) that differed from both S2-1 (25%) and the o3 outputs (30-33%).

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet 4.5's S1-2 at 38%):** Engaged well with the inherited base rate. Explicitly stated "Outside view base rate given: 38%" and systematically applied inside-view updates. The adjustment (-5pp) was modest and well-calibrated, suggesting GPT-5.2 did not over-anchor on the inherited view but also did not reject it.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's S1-3 at 47%):** Engaged through formal statistical modeling rather than direct textual engagement with the inherited reasoning. Effectively recalculated from scratch using its own framework (N(30%, 3%) model) rather than anchoring heavily on the 47% input. This is both a strength (independent thinking) and a weakness (limited engagement with cross-model perspective).

**Same-model instances (S2-1 received S1-1, S2-5 received S1-5):**

- **S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 self-pollination):** Produced the most extreme update (-20pp) and the most extreme final prediction (25%). The self-pollination may have created a reinforcing loop where the model's initial concerns about ceasefire prospects were amplified rather than challenged.

- **S2-5 (o3 self-pollination):** Produced the smallest update (-3pp) and a conservative final prediction (30%). The self-pollination resulted in internal consistency but limited fresh perspective.

**Overall cross-pollination effectiveness:** Moderate. Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) produced a tighter cluster (33-38%) than the self-pollinated instances (25% and 30%), suggesting cross-pollination did help normalize extreme positions. However, S2-4 effectively ignored the cross-pollinated input by rebuilding from scratch, reducing the intended diversity benefit. The most striking effect is that S2-2, starting from the highest outside view (56%), converged to 38% -- still the highest inside view but much closer to the group center, demonstrating that cross-pollination can serve as an effective moderating influence.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All five instances correctly understood this is a meta-prediction question: whether the Metaculus community prediction will be above 31% on Feb 15, not whether a ceasefire will actually occur. This is a critical distinction and all forecasters handled it well.
- All correctly identified the 11-day forecast window (Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2026).
- Most correctly assessed the current state: active fighting, diplomatic rhetoric without results, and community predictions near the 31% threshold. However, some forecasters (S1-1, S1-2) treated the current Metaculus baseline as unknown when the question description stated it was 31.00% as of 2026-02-01.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. The Metaculus community prediction for the underlying question was approximately 31% as of early February 2026, with Manifold showing 30% as a close proxy.
2. SAF leader al-Burhan explicitly rejected ceasefire on February 3, 2026, stating no truce while RSF occupies cities.
3. Active military operations continued in early February 2026, including the SAF breaking the Kadugli siege and an RSF drone strike killing civilians on the same day.
4. Multiple diplomatic initiatives (Quad, Cairo mechanism, Hamdok's European tour) were active but produced no concrete ceasefire agreements.
5. Polymarket showed 12% probability of ceasefire by March 31, 32% by June 30, and 58% by December 31, 2026.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Unsupported statistical claim | Claimed "median offset across 20 recent war-related questions is +4 pp vs Manifold" for Metaculus. No source supports this specific claim. | Medium -- inflated outside view to 56% |
| S1-5 | Contradictory statistical claim | Claimed "Metaculus tends to be 0-4 ppts lower than Manifold for the same cease-fire topics." Directly contradicts S1-4's opposite claim. Neither is sourced. | Medium -- deflated outside view to 33% |
| S1-4 | Ambiguous correlation claim | Stated cross-platform correlation "~0.6-0.7" between Metaculus and market data. S1-5 claimed "~0.8." Neither is sourced from the research. | Low -- used in secondary analysis only |
| S2-1 | Overstatement of novelty | Treated al-Burhan's "no ceasefire" quote as a major new development when the SAF had already failed to respond to the Nov 2025 proposal, making this more of a reconfirmation. | Medium -- drove excessive -20pp update |

### Hallucinations

The specific statistical claims about Metaculus-Manifold offsets from S1-4 and S1-5 are the most concerning potential hallucinations. S1-4 claimed "+4pp" Metaculus premium over Manifold while S1-5 claimed "-1 to -4pp" Metaculus discount relative to Manifold. These are contradictory and neither is supported by any source in the research corpus. They appear to be fabricated reference-class statistics generated by the respective models to support their analytical frameworks. While the existence of such offsets is plausible, the specific magnitudes are invented.

S1-5 also claimed "n~12" for historical Metaculus civil-war ceasefire questions and specific volatility statistics ("median absolute move 1.8 ppts; 90th-percentile 5.0 ppts"). These are plausible but unsourced and likely generated from model priors rather than actual data.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Correct identification of the meta-prediction structure:** All five forecasters correctly recognized that the question is about community prediction behavior, not about ceasefire probability directly. They appropriately focused on prediction market anchors, platform dynamics, and information incorporation speed rather than just ground-truth ceasefire prospects.

2. **Strong current news integration:** The Feb 3 AFP reporting on al-Burhan's ceasefire rejection and the Kadugli siege was identified and appropriately weighted by all inside-view outputs. The Strong/Moderate/Weak evidence framework was applied consistently across forecasters.

3. **Convergent final predictions with justifiable spread:** The final predictions (25%, 38%, 33%, 33%, 30%) converge around 31-33% with a 13pp spread, which is reasonable for a near-threshold meta-prediction question. The convergence of three forecasters on 30-33% provides confidence in the central estimate.

### Weaknesses

1. **Failed agentic search wasted resources:** The agentic search consumed $0.106 (14% of total cost) attempting to externally scrape Metaculus data that was already provided in the question description (the community prediction was 31.00% as of Feb 1). This represents both a cost inefficiency and a missed opportunity to research more relevant topics like Metaculus prediction volatility patterns.

2. **Unsourced statistical claims about platform offsets:** S1-4 and S1-5 made contradictory claims about Metaculus-Manifold prediction offsets (+4pp vs -1 to -4pp). These appear to be hallucinated statistics that directly influenced their outside view predictions in opposite directions. The ensemble averaging happens to cancel out this error, but it represents a fundamental reliability concern.

3. **Inconsistent recognition of the provided baseline:** The question description explicitly states the community prediction was 31.00% as of 2026-02-01. Several forecasters (particularly S1-1, S1-2) treated the current Metaculus value as entirely unknown, creating unnecessary uncertainty. The question was designed around the exact threshold matching the current community prediction, which is highly informative and should have been the primary anchor.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

Justification: The forecast demonstrates good meta-forecasting methodology with correct question comprehension, effective use of prediction market anchors, and appropriate integration of breaking news. The final prediction (31.8%) is well-calibrated for a question where the community prediction was at exactly 31% and recent news was mildly negative. The grade is pulled down from A by: (1) the failed agentic search representing wasted resources, (2) hallucinated platform-offset statistics in two forecasters, and (3) inconsistent recognition of the explicitly provided baseline value. Despite these issues, the ensemble aggregation produced a sensible result that correctly reflects the near-threshold uncertainty.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Recognize provided data before searching:** The question description explicitly contained the current community prediction (31.00% as of 2026-02-01). The query generator should parse structured metadata tags like `{"format":"metaculus_binary_cp_rises","info":{"post_id":41144,"question_id":40845,"last_cp":0.31}}` and surface this as a known anchor before generating queries. This would have prevented the failed agentic search.

2. **Target meta-prediction reference classes:** For "cp_rises" format questions, research should specifically target: (a) How often Metaculus community predictions cross a threshold within 2 weeks, (b) Historical volatility of Metaculus predictions on geopolitical questions, (c) How Metaculus predictions correlate with other platforms. These are more decision-relevant than additional conflict reporting.

3. **Filter irrelevant sources:** The research included an article about Ukraine-Russia talks and two articles about South Sudan's internal conflict. The article summarizer should have flagged these as irrelevant to the Sudan ceasefire question and excluded them.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Inject baseline explicitly into the outside view prompt:** For "cp_rises" questions, the outside view prompt should state: "The current community prediction as of [date] is [X]%. Your task is to determine the probability that this value will be above [threshold]% on [resolution date]." This would eliminate the inconsistency in how forecasters treated the known baseline.

2. **Standardize the Metaculus-vs-other-platforms offset treatment:** Either (a) include a research step that actually estimates cross-platform prediction offsets from data, or (b) instruct forecasters not to assume any particular offset without evidence. The current approach allows models to fabricate statistics that point in opposite directions.

3. **Scale inside-view adjustments to novelty:** S2-1's -20pp shift was driven partly by treating al-Burhan's statement as a major new development. The inside view prompt could instruct forecasters to assess whether new information represents a genuine surprise or a confirmation of the status quo, and to scale their updates accordingly.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (S1-1/S2-1, S1-2/S2-2):** Produces thorough qualitative analysis but can over-react to salient negative news in the inside view (S2-1's -20pp shift). The cross-pollinated instance (S2-2) showed better calibration than the self-pollinated one (S2-1), suggesting Sonnet 4.5 benefits from external perspective.

- **GPT-5.2 (S1-3/S2-3):** Best overall performance. S1-3 produced the most analytically insightful outside view (Polymarket as lower bound due to stricter criteria), and S2-3 produced the best-calibrated inside view update (-5pp). The model shows strong ability to distinguish confirmatory evidence from novel evidence.

- **o3 (S1-4/S2-4, S1-5/S2-5):** Produces the most formally rigorous statistical models but is prone to fabricating specific parameter values (platform offsets, historical volatility statistics). When the fabricated values happen to be wrong, they can significantly bias the estimate. Instruction to clearly distinguish sourced vs. assumed parameters would help.
