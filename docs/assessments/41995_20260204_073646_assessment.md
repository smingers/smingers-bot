## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Extreme outlier from S2-1 relative to other forecasters | High | S2-1 | S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5) assigned only 5% to Increases and 73% to Decreases, far more extreme than the other four forecasters (22-33% Increases, 40-48% Decreases). This single outlier dragged the aggregated distribution toward a much more confident "Decreases" call than the ensemble consensus otherwise supported. |
| Failure to recognize relative scaling problem in resolution criteria | Medium | Research / S1-all | The Google Trends values used for resolution are measured on a *relative* scale within the fixed URL window (Jan 16 - Feb 15). The question background explicitly notes that values can shift as new data is added. Most forecasters treated the current value of 16 as if it were a stable absolute number, but the resolution URL locks the scale to the Jan 16 - Feb 15 period, meaning the peak in late January (shutdown spike) anchors 100 and both Feb 4 and Feb 15 values are relative to that peak. This subtlety was largely ignored. |
| Most AskNews articles irrelevant to question | Medium | Research | Of ~16 AskNews articles returned for the current search, only 1-2 had any relevance to OPM. The rest covered topics like eurozone inflation, oil markets, Bitcoin, Indian trade, and Chinese banking. The search query was too broad. |
| Inconsistent directional splits of base rate across forecasters | Medium | S1-1 through S1-5 | The 72% "change" base rate was split between Increases and Decreases very differently: S1-4 used 35%/37%, S1-5 used 36%/36%, while S1-1 used 8%/75% and S1-2 used 15%/53%. The empirical data did not clearly support such divergent splits. |
| DHS Feb 13 deadline underweighted by most forecasters | Low | S1-1 / S1-2 / S2-1 | The DHS funding deadline on Feb 13 (2 days before resolution) was a plausible catalyst for renewed OPM-related search interest. Most forecasters either dismissed or minimally addressed this, though S2-3 and S2-4 gave it appropriate consideration. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. `opm february 2026 events` (Google)
2. `opm announcement feb 2026` (Google News)
3. `Retrieve 90-day US Google Trends daily values for "opm"; compute distribution of 11-day changes >=+/-4; list any scheduled events 4-15 Feb 2026 that mention OPM or "Original Pilipino Music."` (Agent)
4. `opm` (Google Trends)

**Current Queries:**
1. `opm february 2026 events schedule` (Google)
2. `office personnel management 2026 february news` (Google News)
3. `Provide upcoming and recent U.S. Office of Personnel Management headlines or events likely to occur between February 4 and February 15 2026 that could affect public attention.` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Historical base rates; 90-day volatility; scheduled events in Feb 4-15 window | Very recent news (Feb 2-4); upcoming events and catalysts |
| Content type | Google Trends data, OPM event schedule, background on OPM agency | News articles on shutdown, furloughs, backpay; current event calendars |
| Unique contribution | Critical base-rate statistics (72% change rate, current value 16, mean 18.1, std dev 14.3); event listing (OPM rule effective Feb 13, OPM concerts) | Shutdown timeline (ended Feb 3), DHS funding deadline Feb 13, OPM guidance controversy on backpay |

**Analysis:**

The two query sets have moderate overlap -- both search for "opm february 2026 events" -- but serve distinct purposes. The historical set correctly prioritized obtaining Google Trends quantitative data (the single most valuable input for this question type) and successfully retrieved 90-day base rates. The agent query was well-structured, requesting both quantitative data and event listings, though the agent correctly noted it could not directly download the CSV (the pipeline's Google Trends integration handled this separately).

The current queries were reasonably targeted. The Google News query usefully spelled out "office personnel management" rather than just the ambiguous acronym. The AskNews query was well-phrased in natural language. However, the AskNews results were overwhelmingly irrelevant -- only the Validated Insights "OPM market" article and the Mumbai Mirror "OPM wallahs" reference had any connection to the term "opm," and neither was about the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in the Feb 4-15 context.

**Critical information gap:** None of the queries specifically targeted the DHS funding deadline (Feb 13) as a potential catalyst for renewed OPM-related news. This was discovered incidentally in the GovExec articles. A query like "DHS funding deadline February 2026" or "government shutdown February 2026" would have surfaced this more directly.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs are appropriately factual. The article summaries describe events and provide data without offering probability estimates. The Google Trends data block provides base-rate statistics (28% "Doesn't change" rate) that are factual derivations, not forecasts. The agent report appropriately listed events and described what data was missing without predicting outcomes.

One minor concern: the Polymarket summary notes it is "relevant to forecasting" and comments that the shutdown "would likely drive significant search interest," which edges toward forecasting language rather than pure factual reporting. However, this is mild and did not inappropriately anchor the forecasters.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Google Trends base rates: 72% of 12-day windows show >3 point changes, current value 16, mean 18.1, std dev 14.3
  - Recent trend direction: steep decline from 46.6 (prior week avg) to 23.7 (last week avg) to 16 (current)
  - Government shutdown ended Feb 3, one day before forecast window begins
  - OPM was directly involved in shutdown (guidance on backpay, agency itself furloughed)
  - No major OPM-specific events scheduled Feb 4-15 except minor regulatory effective date Feb 13
  - DHS funding deadline Feb 13 (potential catalyst)
  - Multiple meanings of "opm" (Office of Personnel Management, Original Pilipino Music, Online Program Manager)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - No specific analysis of how relative scaling in the fixed-date Trends URL (Jan 16 - Feb 15) affects the Feb 4 and Feb 15 values. The presence of the late-January shutdown spike within this URL window means both Feb 4 and Feb 15 values are scaled relative to that peak, potentially compressing both values.
  - No historical data on how "opm" search interest behaved after previous government shutdowns (2018-2019, fall 2025).
  - No weather forecast for DC area Feb 4-15 (OPM weather closures are a known search driver).

- **Source quality:** High for Government Executive articles (specialist outlet); high for Google Trends data (first-party data); medium for agent report (thorough but unable to retrieve CSV); low for most AskNews articles (irrelevant).

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all 8 sources. Correctly identified Google Trends data as the most critical input and the Polymarket resolution as confirmation of a recent shutdown. Appropriately noted that most OPM.gov content was administrative and low-relevance. Quality: Good, though the assessment of "Original Pilipino Music" concerts as "irrelevant to US Google Trends" is slightly overconfident -- diaspora searches could contribute marginally. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified four possible reference classes and chose "OPM search interest following government shutdown announcements, combined with typical post-crisis decay patterns." This is reasonable but arguably overfits to the specific narrative rather than anchoring on the more defensible empirical base rate. The discussion was well-structured. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 11-day window. Engaged with the current trajectory (46.6 -> 23.7 -> 16). Did not explicitly discuss what happens if timeframe is halved/doubled (this is a Step 2 requirement, so acceptable). Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from the 72% base rate but then applied a very strong directional tilt. The split of 72% into "8% Increases, 17% Doesn't change, 75% Decreases" is aggressive. The 8% for Increases is very low given that the empirical data shows roughly symmetric increases/decreases. The momentum argument has merit but the magnitude of the tilt is excessive for an outside view. Score: 2/4.

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- Assigned probabilities to all three options: Increases 8%, Doesn't change 17%, Decreases 75%.
- Sum = 100%. Correct.
- Did consider correlations between options (identified that decay affects both Increases and Doesn't change).
- The extreme skew toward Decreases (75%) based on momentum arguments goes beyond what the outside view base rate supports. The 90-day data shows roughly equal incidence of increases and decreases among the 72% that change.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation of all sources with quality ratings. Correctly identified the Polymarket shutdown confirmation and Google Trends data as most relevant. Noted that the OPM announcements archive was "outdated for current prediction." Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three reference classes and chose a hybrid: "generic base rate combined with post-event decay analysis." The reasoning was sound -- starting from empirical 72%/28% split and then adding directional context. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly noted 11-day window and that provided stats use 12-day approximation. Discussed recent trajectory and high coefficient of variation (79%). Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from 72% change / 28% stable. Split 72% as approximately 60% Decreases / 12% Increases based on momentum. Then applied mean-reversion adjustment to get final 53%/32%/15%. This is more moderate than S1-1 but still assigns only 15% to Increases, which may underweight the empirical symmetry. The mean-reversion adjustment was a thoughtful correction. Score: 3/4.

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- All options assigned: Increases 15%, Doesn't change 32%, Decreases 53%.
- Sum = 100%. Correct.
- Considered correlation (mean reversion from near-mean levels).
- More balanced than S1-1 but still heavily favors Decreases without strong empirical justification for the directional asymmetry.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough, well-structured analysis with explicit quality and relevance ratings for each source. Notably cautious about the agent report's overseas concert listings ("geographic mismatch weakens expected impact"). Correctly identified the Google Trends data as "the only directly decision-relevant quantitative summary." Score: 4/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three classes and clearly selected the term-specific 90-day 12-day-window change frequencies. Justified the choice well (same keyword, geography, metric, horizon). Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 11-day window, noted the 12-day approximation is close enough. Identified the key historical pattern: 28% no-change rate. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchored firmly on the empirical base rate: 28% Doesn't change, then split 72% with a "mild bearish tilt" as 27% Increases / 44% Decreases. This is the most disciplined approach among S1 outputs -- it stays close to the data while incorporating a modest directional signal. The final distribution (27/29/44) is well-calibrated. Score: 3/4.

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- All options assigned: Increases 27%, Doesn't change 29%, Decreases 44%.
- Sum = 100%. Correct.
- Explicitly acknowledged that GT is noisy and reversals are common.
- Well-balanced distribution that respects the base rate while incorporating directional signal.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but adequate. Covered all sources with quality assessments. Noted that the Google Trends data is "medium" quality since it cannot be independently replicated -- a thoughtful caveat. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Considered three classes (federal agency acronyms, mixed-meaning acronyms, exact "opm" history) and correctly chose the most specific one. Noted the dual-meaning nature of "opm" as contributing to spiky behavior. Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct on the 11-day window. Provided an interesting quantitative analysis: claimed that conditional on change, roughly 52% were increases and 48% decreases in the 90-day sample. This statistic is not directly provided in the data; it appears to be an inference or assumption. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derived P(Doesn't change) = 0.28, P(Increases) = 0.52 x 0.72 = 0.37, P(Decreases) = 0.48 x 0.72 = 0.35. Then applied a 2-point momentum adjustment: final 35/28/37. This is the most empirically grounded derivation, starting from a near-symmetric split and applying minimal adjustment. The claimed 52/48 conditional split is unverified but plausible. Score: 3/4.

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- All options assigned: Increases 35%, Doesn't change 28%, Decreases 37%.
- Sum = 100%. Correct.
- Distribution is nearly symmetric, with only a 2pp tilt toward Decreases for momentum.
- Explicitly cited literature (Goel et al. 2010; Choi & Varian 2012) on momentum persistence -- a strong analytical move.
- Very close to pure base rate; minimal directional adjustment is well-justified.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and efficient. Correctly identified that the Google Trends data is the "only numerically rich, high-value source for the base rate." Explicitly noted that the 90-day data cannot be independently verified but accepted it as given. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Considered three classes (same term, comparable agency acronyms, generic search terms) and chose the narrowest: "opm" 11-day windows. Justified by requiring "no heroic assumptions." Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 11-day window and the 79-window sample size. Noted the +-6pp sampling error. This quantitative treatment of sampling uncertainty is unique among the forecasters and commendable. Score: 4/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derived 28% Doesn't change, then split the remaining 72% exactly 50/50 as 36/36 for Increases/Decreases. Explicitly stated that "lacking evidence of systematic drift, a 50/50 split is a reasonable first approximation." This is the most conservative and methodologically pure approach. Score: 3/4 (loses a point for not incorporating even the obvious directional signal from recent momentum, which is legitimately outside-view information).

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- All options assigned: Increases 36%, Doesn't change 28%, Decreases 36%.
- Sum = 100%. Correct.
- Perfectly symmetric outside view anchored entirely on base rates.
- Acknowledged sampling uncertainty (+-6pp) which none of the other forecasters did.
- Appropriately conservative for a pure outside view.

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Inc/NC/Dec) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 8% / 17% / 75% | 11/16 | Strong narrative analysis of post-shutdown decay | Excessive directional skew; 8% Increases is too low for outside view |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 15% / 32% / 53% | 12/16 | Thoughtful mean-reversion correction | Still underweights Increases relative to base rate |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 27% / 29% / 44% | 14/16 | Disciplined base-rate anchoring with mild directional tilt | Could have engaged more with the trajectory data |
| S1-4 | o3 | 35% / 28% / 37% | 13/16 | Most empirically grounded; cited academic literature | Claimed 52/48 conditional split without verifiable evidence |
| S1-5 | o3 | 36% / 28% / 36% | 14/16 | Pure base-rate approach with sampling uncertainty analysis | Possibly too conservative; ignores obvious momentum signal |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (Inc/NC/Dec) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5, self-model) | 8% / 17% / 75% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 35% / 28% / 37% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 15% / 32% / 53% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 27% / 29% / 44% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3, self-model) | 36% / 28% / 36% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Categorized evidence as Strong (shutdown timeline, decay data, no new catalysts), Moderate (post-crisis decay pattern, base rate volatility), and Weak (DHS deadline Feb 13, alternative OPM meanings). The framework was used systematically. Appropriately weighted the shutdown resolution as the dominant signal. However, the DHS Feb 13 deadline was categorized as "Weak" and then largely dismissed -- it deserved at least "Moderate" given that it falls 2 days before resolution. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 8/17/75 -> Output: 5/22/73. Delta: Increases -3pp, Doesn't change +5pp, Decreases -2pp. The direction of update is puzzling: the inside view evidence (shutdown just ended, post-event decay confirmed) should logically reinforce the Decreases thesis, yet the update slightly *reduced* Decreases from 75% to 73% while increasing Doesn't change. This suggests the forecaster recognized the outside view was already extremely skewed and made a minor correction toward the center. The final 5% for Increases is very low. Score: 2/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addressed halved (5-6 days) and doubled (22 days) windows with directional reasoning. If halved: more "Doesn't change" (25-30%); if doubled: more "Decreases" (85-90%). This analysis is sensible. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all 6 elements (paraphrase, base rate, consistency check, top evidence, blind spot, technicalities). The blind spot identified -- unexpected OPM policy announcement -- is appropriate. Probabilities sum to 100%. Score: 3/4.

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- Updates preserved sum = 100%. Correct.
- Relative adjustments: Doesn't change increased (+5pp), Increases decreased (-3pp), Decreases decreased (-2pp). This partially corrects the extreme S1-1 skew.
- Most affected option: Doesn't change (largest magnitude shift).
- The final distribution remains extremely skewed (73% Decreases) and this forecaster is a clear outlier.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Used Strong/Moderate/Weak framework systematically. Identified three strong evidence items (shutdown timeline, decay data at 50% weekly decline, no scheduled events), three moderate items (post-crisis decay pattern, shutdown resolved with backpay, mean reversion tendency), and two weak items (Philippine concerts, general government events). The DHS Feb 13 deadline was mentioned but not given a formal evidence weight. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 35/28/37 -> Output: 30/25/45. Delta: Increases -5pp, Doesn't change -3pp, Decreases +8pp. The direction is correct: inside view evidence of post-shutdown decay and absence of catalysts appropriately shifts mass toward Decreases. The magnitude is reasonable. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved and doubled timeframes. If halved: increased confidence in Decreases (50-55%); if doubled: increased "Doesn't change" (35-40%). Sensible directional reasoning. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all elements. Identified blind spots (unexpected OPM controversy or policy announcement). Explicitly noted that the 30% Increases "remains plausible" due to high volatility and potential catalysts. Score: 3/4.

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- Sum = 100%. Correct.
- Relative adjustments: shifted 8pp net toward Decreases, reducing both Increases and Doesn't change.
- Most affected option by new evidence: Decreases (gained most).
- The intermediate calculation shown in the output has an error (30+25+45=100, correct, but the working showed a failed first attempt before recalibrating). This suggests some difficulty with the constraint.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured analysis with Strong (shutdown ended Feb 3, DHS Feb 13 deadline as catalyst risk, base-rate volatility), Moderate (OPM guidance controversy, winter operating-status announcements), and Weak (alternative OPM meanings). Notably, this is the only forecaster to classify the DHS Feb 13 deadline as "Strong evidence" -- a meaningful catalyst that others underweighted. Score: 4/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 15/32/53 -> Output: 23/29/48. Delta: Increases +8pp, Doesn't change -3pp, Decreases -5pp. The update direction is interesting: despite post-shutdown decay evidence, this forecaster *increased* the probability of Increases. The justification is that the DHS funding deadline on Feb 13 creates a credible re-spike risk. This is a thoughtful, non-obvious update that appropriately weights a structural catalyst. Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addressed halved (higher Decreases) and doubled (higher Increases as deadline effects play out). Clear causal reasoning. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all elements. Identified the DHS deadline as a specific, within-window risk. Checklist is thorough. Score: 3/4.

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- Sum = 100%. Correct.
- Relative adjustments: +8pp Increases, -5pp Decreases, -3pp Doesn't change. Sensible given the Feb 13 catalyst.
- Most affected option: Increases (gained most from inside view evidence about DHS deadline).
- This is the most analytically nuanced update among all forecasters.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Classified evidence as Strong (post-event decay, DHS Feb 13 deadline, base-rate volatility), Moderate (OPM guidance controversy, winter operating-status announcements), and Weak (alternative OPM meanings). Like S2-3, appropriately flagged the DHS deadline as a meaningful within-window catalyst. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 27/29/44 -> Output: 22/30/48. Delta: Increases -5pp, Doesn't change +1pp, Decreases +4pp. Direction correct: the post-shutdown decay evidence and absence of major catalysts shifts mass toward Decreases, while the DHS deadline creates a modest floor under Doesn't change. Magnitude is moderate and well-justified. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved (higher "no change" by ~5pp) and doubled (higher "decrease" by ~7pp). Concise but adequate. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed in condensed format. All key elements present: paraphrase, base rate, consistency, key evidence (5 items), blind spot (DHS drama, viral OPM meme). Score: 3/4.

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- Sum = 100%. Correct.
- Relative adjustments: modest shift toward Decreases (-5pp from Inc, +4pp to Dec).
- Most affected option: Increases (lost most, 5pp).
- Well-calibrated moderate update from a well-calibrated outside view.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Brief but structured analysis. Classified shutdown coverage as "Moderate evidence" (not Strong), reasoning that the Feb 4 value already reflects the event. This is a defensible but unusual assessment. Noted DHS deadline and weather as weak-to-moderate risks. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 36/28/36 -> Output: 33/27/40. Delta: Increases -3pp, Doesn't change -1pp, Decreases +4pp. Very modest update from the symmetric base rate. The direction is correct (post-shutdown decay), and the magnitude is conservative. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief mention: halving would give higher volatility; doubling would shrink noise and push "Doesn't change" up ~5pp. Adequate. Score: 2/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed concisely. Identified blind spots (major snowstorm, federal-pay headline). All key elements present. Score: 3/4.

**Multiple choice specific assessment:**
- Sum = 100%. Correct.
- Relative adjustments: Very conservative 4pp net shift toward Decreases.
- Most affected option: Decreases (gained 4pp).
- The forecaster stayed very close to the base rate, making only a small inside-view adjustment. This is methodologically conservative but arguably underweights the clearly directional inside-view evidence.

- **Score:** 11/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input (Inc/NC/Dec) | Final (Inc/NC/Dec) | Delta (Inc/NC/Dec) | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 8/17/75 | 5/22/73 | -3/+5/-2 | 11/16 | Partial -- minor correction to extreme outside view, but final remains outlier |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 35/28/37 | 30/25/45 | -5/-3/+8 | 12/16 | Yes -- appropriately shifted toward Decreases based on post-shutdown decay |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 15/32/53 | 23/29/48 | +8/-3/-5 | 14/16 | Yes -- insightful update incorporating DHS Feb 13 deadline risk |
| S2-4 | o3 | 27/29/44 | 22/30/48 | -5/+1/+4 | 12/16 | Yes -- moderate, well-justified shift toward Decreases |
| S2-5 | o3 | 36/28/36 | 33/27/40 | -3/-1/+4 | 11/16 | Partial -- update direction correct but magnitude too conservative |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4 from o3):** Yes. S2-2 received S1-4's near-symmetric base-rate forecast (35/28/37) and made a meaningful directional adjustment (+8pp to Decreases), incorporating the post-shutdown decay narrative that the o3 outside view had deliberately left out. This is a constructive cross-pollination outcome: the o3 base rate provided a well-calibrated starting point, and the Sonnet 4.5 inside view added the directional signal.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2 from Sonnet 4.5):** Yes, and this was the most effective cross-pollination. S2-3 received S1-2's moderately Decreases-favoring forecast (15/32/53) and made a counter-intuitive but well-reasoned adjustment: *increasing* the Increases probability by 8pp due to the DHS Feb 13 deadline. This demonstrates genuine independent thinking rather than anchoring on the received input.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3 from GPT-5.2):** Yes. S2-4 received S1-3's well-balanced forecast (27/29/44) and made a moderate shift further toward Decreases (22/30/48). The o3 model engaged with the GPT-5.2 base rate and made sensible, small adjustments.

**Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**

S2-1 arguably over-weighted its own S1-1 input (which was already extreme at 8/17/75) and made only minimal corrections (-3/+5/-2), resulting in the most extreme final prediction in the ensemble (5/22/73). This suggests that the self-model cross-pollination (Sonnet 4.5 reading its own Sonnet 4.5 outside view) reinforced an already extreme position.

**Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**

Yes. The same-model instances produced the two most extreme/conservative outcomes:
- S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 self) produced the most extreme distribution (5/22/73)
- S2-5 (o3 self) produced the most conservative update (33/27/40, only +4pp shift)

The cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) all produced more moderate, balanced outputs. This pattern suggests cross-pollination is working as intended: exposing forecasters to different model perspectives produces more calibrated outputs.

**Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**

Cross-pollination *decreased* diversity in the middle of the distribution (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4 converged toward a 22-30% / 25-30% / 45-48% range) while the self-model instances maintained the extreme ends. The net effect was moderate convergence with maintained outliers, which is suboptimal for aggregation.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria:
- Compare Google Trends US daily value for "opm" on Feb 15 vs Feb 4
- "Doesn't change" = within +/-3 points
- "Increases" = more than 3 greater
- "Decreases" = more than 3 lower

All correctly identified the 11-day forecast window (Feb 4 to Feb 15). All correctly identified the current value as 16 on Feb 4.

One nuance that none fully grappled with: the resolution URL uses a fixed date range (Jan 16 - Feb 15, 2026). This means the scale is relative to the peak within that window. The late-January shutdown spike (values around 46+) anchors the top of the scale, potentially compressing both Feb 4 and Feb 15 values. This relative scaling could reduce the absolute difference between the two dates, making "Doesn't change" more likely than a simple comparison of raw values would suggest. No forecaster addressed this subtlety.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. A government shutdown occurred around Jan 31 - Feb 3, 2026, directly involving OPM. (All 10 outputs)
2. The current Google Trends value for "opm" is 16, which is below the 90-day mean of 18.1 and shows a steep recent decline. (All 10 outputs)
3. Approximately 72% of 12-day windows in the past 90 days show changes exceeding +/-3 points. (All 10 outputs)
4. No major OPM-specific events are scheduled for Feb 4-15, except a minor regulatory effective date on Feb 13. (Most outputs)
5. DHS funding expires Feb 13, creating a potential catalyst for renewed shutdown-related OPM searches. (5 of 10 outputs)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Unverified claim | Stated "conditional on change, about 52% were increases, 48% decreases" -- this statistic is not provided in the data and cannot be verified from the given inputs | Low |
| S1-4 | Literature citations | Cited "Goel et al. 2010; Choi & Varian 2012" for momentum in search data -- plausible but unverifiable references in this context | Low |
| S2-1 | Mischaracterization | Stated "mathematical projection: ~10-12 by Feb 15" based on exponential decay curve -- this is a speculative extrapolation presented as mathematical fact | Medium |
| S2-2 | Arithmetic error | Showed intermediate calculation that did not sum to 100%, then self-corrected | Low |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. All factual claims about the shutdown, OPM's role, Google Trends data, and scheduled events can be traced to the research artifacts. The literature citations in S1-4 (Goel et al. 2010; Choi & Varian 2012) are plausible real papers about Google search trends, though they cannot be verified from the provided materials.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Excellent base-rate anchoring across most forecasters.** Four of five forecasters (S1-2 through S1-5) started from the empirical 72%/28% base rate and derived their outside views systematically from this anchor. This is exactly the right approach for Google Trends forecasting where historical volatility data is available.

2. **Strong research pipeline with Google Trends integration.** The pipeline successfully retrieved actual Google Trends data (current value, 90-day statistics, base-rate analysis) which was the single most decision-relevant input. The historical search also surfaced the government shutdown context and scheduled events within the window.

3. **Cross-pollination produced the best individual output.** S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet 4.5's outside view) delivered the most analytically nuanced inside-view update, correctly identifying the DHS Feb 13 deadline as a structural catalyst that others missed. This demonstrates the value of exposing models to different perspectives.

### Weaknesses

1. **Extreme outlier in S2-1 skewed the aggregate.** S2-1's 5/22/73 distribution is dramatically different from the other four forecasters (22-33 / 25-30 / 40-48). In an equal-weighted average, this single outlier shifted the final Decreases probability to 50.8% and Increases to 22.6%. A median-based or trimmed-mean aggregation would have produced a more representative result around 23/28/48.

2. **Inconsistent handling of directional splits in Step 1.** The five outside-view predictions varied widely in their treatment of the symmetric base rate. S1-1 assigned only 8% to Increases; S1-5 assigned 36%. This 28-percentage-point spread on the same base rate using the same evidence reflects insufficient methodological discipline in the prompts about how to split the change probability.

3. **Incomplete treatment of resolution mechanism.** No forecaster addressed the relative scaling issue in the fixed-date URL. The January shutdown spike within the Jan 16 - Feb 15 window could compress both endpoint values, making small absolute differences more likely and potentially favoring "Doesn't change." This is a meaningful analytical gap.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B-**

The forecast demonstrates good research fundamentals (Google Trends data retrieval, base-rate anchoring, event identification) and the cross-pollination mechanism produced genuinely valuable analytical diversity. However, the extreme S2-1 outlier and inconsistent directional splits undermine the aggregated result. The core directional judgment (Decreases most likely) is well-supported by the evidence, but the magnitude of confidence in Decreases (50.8%) may be excessive given the relative scaling issue and the DHS Feb 13 deadline risk.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Add a query specifically targeting potential within-window catalysts.** A query like "government shutdown February 2026 upcoming" or "DHS funding deadline February 2026" would have more directly surfaced the Feb 13 deadline risk.

2. **Improve AskNews query specificity.** The current query for "Will the interest in 'opm' change..." was too broad and returned mostly irrelevant international financial news. A query focused on "U.S. Office of Personnel Management news and events February 2026, including government shutdown and federal workforce" would yield better results.

3. **Add a historical comparisons query.** A query for previous OPM search behavior after government shutdowns (2018-2019, fall 2025) would provide a more specific reference class for the post-shutdown decay pattern.

4. **Surface weather forecasts for DC area.** OPM weather closures are a known driver of "opm" searches. Including a weather forecast query for the prediction window would address this gap.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Address relative scaling in Google Trends questions.** The prompt should explicitly ask forecasters to consider how the fixed-date URL's relative scaling affects the comparison between the two endpoint values, especially when a large spike falls within the URL's date range.

2. **Provide guidance on splitting the base-rate "change" probability.** The prompts should instruct forecasters to start from a symmetric split of the change probability and then justify any directional tilt with specific evidence. This would reduce the wild inconsistency observed (8% vs 36% Increases) in the outside view.

3. **Consider robust aggregation methods.** A trimmed mean or median-based aggregation would reduce the impact of extreme outliers like S2-1. With only 5 forecasters, a single outlier has outsized influence on the equal-weighted average.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (forecasters 1, 2):** Tends to incorporate narrative reasoning (post-shutdown decay, momentum) more aggressively into the outside view, producing larger directional tilts than the data alone supports. The self-model cross-pollination (S2-1 <- S1-1) reinforced rather than corrected this tendency.

- **GPT-5.2 (forecaster 3):** Produced the most balanced outside view and the most insightful inside-view update. The ability to identify the DHS deadline as a structural catalyst was a standout contribution. No significant concerns.

- **o3 (forecasters 4, 5):** Produced the most methodologically disciplined outside views, closely anchored to base rates. However, the inside-view updates were very conservative (only 4pp shifts), potentially underweighting clearly directional evidence. Could benefit from slightly more aggressive updating when inside-view evidence is strong.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range for any option | Yes | Decreases ranged 40-73% (33pp spread); Increases ranged 5-33% (28pp spread). Both exceed 20pp threshold. |
| Update direction errors | No | All forecasters moved in the direction supported by their evidence (post-shutdown decay -> more Decreases). S2-3's increase in "Increases" was justified by DHS deadline, not an error. |
| Factual errors present | No | No material factual errors detected across any outputs. |
| Hallucinations detected | No | All factual claims traceable to research artifacts. |
| Cross-pollination effective | Yes | Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) produced more balanced outputs than self-model instances (S2-1, S2-5). S2-3 produced the best individual analysis. |
| Critical info missed in research | Yes | Relative scaling in the fixed-date URL; historical OPM search behavior after previous shutdowns; DC weather forecast for Feb 4-15. |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All forecasters correctly used the 72%/28% base rate from the Google Trends data. |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | S2-1 (5/22/73) is a clear outlier. For Decreases: mean=50.8, SD=12.8; S2-1's 73% is 1.73 SD above mean. For Increases: mean=22.6, SD=10.5; S2-1's 5% is 1.68 SD below mean. |
