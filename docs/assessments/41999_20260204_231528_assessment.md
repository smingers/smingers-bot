## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agentic search failed to retrieve target question data | High | Research | The agentic search spent its entire budget trying to access Metaculus Q41089 via unauthenticated web search and returned zero usable data about the CP time series or its trajectory. The bot already has an API token and could have queried the authenticated endpoint directly. |
| Forecaster spread of 37pp (25%-62%) | High | Aggregation | The ensemble produced a very wide range of final predictions, indicating fundamental disagreement about how to model short-term CP drift. The equal-weight average (43.6%) obscures this disagreement. |
| S2-1 over-adjusted downward from outside view | Med | S2-1 | Forecaster 1 moved from 35% to 25% based on inside view evidence, a -10pp swing that appears over-weighted toward CNBC survey's 23% recession probability, conflating the underlying recession question with the meta-question about CP drift. |
| S2-2 over-adjusted upward from outside view | Med | S2-2 | Forecaster 2 moved from 55% to 62%, a +7pp swing, partly justified by "meta-gaming" effects that are speculative and difficult to quantify. |
| Irrelevant search results in current context | Low | Research | Several AskNews articles (Italian GDP, Romanian GDP, Brazilian politics, Mexican inflation) had no relevance to the US GDP meta-question and added noise without value. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

- **Question Type:** binary
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-02-04
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-02-14
- **Forecast Window:** 10 days
- **Final Prediction:** 43.6%
- **Step 2 Predictions:** S2-1: 25%, S2-2: 62%, S2-3: 43%, S2-4: 51%, S2-5: 37%
- **Spread:** 37pp (25% to 62%)
- **Total Cost:** $0.87
- **Duration:** 309 seconds

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "US recession probability 2026 forecast" (Google)
2. "US GDP forecast 2026 Q1" (Google News)
3. "Retrieve historical community prediction time series and main arguments for Metaculus question 41089; identify major shifts since January 1 2026 and likely upcoming catalysts before February 14 2026" (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. "US GDP growth forecast 2026 recession risk" (Google)
2. "US recession probability 2026 forecast" (Google News)
3. "What are economists projecting for US GDP growth in early 2026 and chance of negative quarters?" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | General 2026 outlook and recession probability; attempted to retrieve Metaculus CP history | Very recent (Jan-Feb 2026) macro data and forecasts |
| Content type | Institutional economic outlooks (Goldman, JPM, Deloitte, RSM); Polymarket market structure; Metaculus API access analysis | Morgan Stanley outlook, CNBC survey, Conference Board, administration claims, recent data releases |
| Unique contribution | Established the expert recession probability band (20-35%); identified the Metaculus CP data gap | Surfaced the declining trend in recession probabilities (CNBC: 53%->23%); recent Conference Board slowdown warning; December jobs data |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets have moderate overlap. Both historical query 1 ("US recession probability 2026 forecast") and current query 1 ("US GDP growth forecast 2026 recession risk") target nearly identical content, leading to some duplicated sources (Goldman Sachs, RSM, JPM appear in both phases).
- Historical queries appropriately targeted base-rate establishment by seeking institutional recession probabilities. The agentic search query was well-designed but ultimately fruitless because it attempted to scrape a Metaculus question that requires authentication. This was a significant waste of the agent's search budget.
- Current queries did surface recent decision-relevant events: the CNBC Fed survey (Jan 27), Conference Board note (Jan 30), and the December jobs report. However, no query specifically targeted upcoming economic data releases (e.g., "US economic data calendar February 2026") which would have been highly relevant for a 10-day drift question.
- Critical information gap: No query attempted to retrieve the actual current Metaculus community prediction for Q41089 (which may have moved from 27% since Feb 1). The bot has an API token but the research pipeline did not use it.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remain largely factual, reporting institutional recession probabilities and GDP forecasts from named economists. The sources appropriately cite these as expert opinions rather than definitive forecasts. The AskNews articles are factual news summaries. The agent report is purely procedural (about data accessibility). No research output inappropriately presents its own probability estimate for the meta-question. This is well-handled.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Institutional recession probability band: Goldman Sachs (20%), CNBC survey (23%), RSM (30%), JPM (35%)
  - Trend in recession probabilities: declining over past 8 months (CNBC survey: 53% -> 30% -> 23%)
  - Recent GDP performance: Q3 2025 at 4.3%, strong momentum
  - Baseline 2026 GDP growth forecasts: 1.8-2.5% from various institutions
  - Conference Board warning about early 2026 slowdown from tariffs
  - Weak December 2025 jobs report (50K vs 73K expected)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Current Metaculus CP for Q41089 (may have moved from 27% since Feb 1)
  - Historical CP time series and volatility patterns for this specific question
  - Scheduled economic data releases between Feb 4-14 (payrolls, CPI dates)
  - Polymarket current price for recession market (would provide a real-time crowd estimate)
  - Q4 2025 GDP advance estimate result (mentioned as released Jan 29 but actual number not in search results)

- **Source quality:** Generally high for institutional sources (Goldman, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Conference Board, CNBC survey). Several AskNews results were irrelevant (Italian, Romanian, Brazilian, Mexican economic data). The TD Bank Canadian provincial forecast was a low-value result.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough and well-organized. Each source is rated for quality, key facts are extracted, and expert opinions are attributed to named individuals. Correctly identifies the TD Bank article as low-relevance. Appropriately flags the agent report's failure to retrieve data. Score: 4/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three reference classes: (1) expert recession probability forecasts, (2) historical Metaculus CP stability over 13-day periods, (3) GDP growth forecasts implying negative growth probability. Correctly selects the first as most suitable while acknowledging the ideal class (historical CP movement) is unavailable. However, does not adequately distinguish between "recession probability" and "any single negative GDP quarter" -- the latter is a lower bar. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies the 10-day window and lists potential information flows (jobs, retail, manufacturing data, Fed commentary, tariff announcements). Notes that community predictions tend to be sticky in short timeframes. However, does not identify specific scheduled data releases with dates. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derives a 50% baseline from random walk behavior, then adjusts systematically: -10 to -15pp for expert downward trend, -5pp for sticky predictions, +5pp for continuous updates, -5pp for information asymmetry. Arrives at 30%, then adjusts up to 35%. The arithmetic is transparent but the adjustments are somewhat arbitrary (e.g., "information asymmetry" moving predictions is a contestable claim). The reasoning that expert forecasts trending downward should suppress the CP upward probability is sound but the magnitude of adjustment (-15pp) may be aggressive. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Derived 35% probability with clear reasoning path.
- Did consider both Yes pathway (minor upward fluctuation, bad economic data) and No pathway (downward expert trend, stickiness).
- Correctly identified the asymmetric threshold (>27.00%, meaning 27.01% resolves Yes).

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Competent analysis similar to S1-1 but less detailed. Sources are categorized by quality and key facts extracted. Correctly notes the Polymarket limitation (no current probability) and the agent report conclusion. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three reference classes including professional estimates, historical Metaculus CP movement, and historical accuracy of community vs professional forecasts. Selection of professional estimates is reasonable. Notes that the question asks about "single negative quarter" which is a lower bar than recession -- a nuance S1-1 missed. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 10-day window. Notes being exactly at threshold creates high sensitivity. Lists potential catalysts (Fed communications, employment data). Notes Metaculus communities can shift 5-10pp on major news. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from ~50% baseline, considers professional consensus averaging ~28% (slightly above current 27%), and the asymmetric threshold. Arrives at 53% with reasoning that the slight professional consensus above 27% and the lower bar of "any negative quarter" create modest upward bias. The calibration is transparent and close to a coin flip, which is intellectually honest for this question type. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Derived 53% with explicit reasoning.
- Considered both pathways: upward (professional average slightly above 27%, lower bar for single negative quarter) and downward (Goldman optimism, no immediate bad news).
- Good insight about "question reduces to: will CP drift up or down from exactly 27%?"

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Highly structured with explicit fact/opinion distinction for each source. Uses quality ratings (medium, high-ish). Notably skeptical of Goldman Sachs' forecast, noting it's "not an observed market price." Correctly identifies the net from sources: macro anchors 20-35%, but missing the key Metaculus CP volatility dataset. Score: 4/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three well-differentiated reference classes: (1) Metaculus binary questions near 25-30% with 1-2 week horizon, (2) short-horizon random walk for stable macro question, (3) expert consensus as "magnet" for crowd CP. Selects combination of (2) and (3) as most suitable. This is the most sophisticated reference class analysis in the ensemble. Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 10-day window. Makes the important observation that "no single datapoint in the next 10 days is likely to resolve much of the uncertainty" about Q1-Q3 GDP. Identifies the strict ">" threshold and notes the tie probability. Score: 4/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Arrives at 51% through careful reasoning: starts from ~50/50 symmetric process, adds small lean to Yes based on (i) expert anchors including 30%+ recession probabilities, (ii) "any negative quarter" being at least as plausible as recession, (iii) analysis of strict ">" threshold. The calibration is rigorous and conservative, acknowledging the near-coin-flip nature. Score: 3/4 (slight deduction for not quantifying the adjustments more precisely).

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Derived 51% with transparent reasoning.
- Excellent consideration of both pathways: symmetry of random walk vs. slight upward pull from expert anchors.
- Correctly notes "exact 27.00%" resolves No, which is a subtle point several others missed.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and effective. Each source is rated and summarized. Adds useful detail about Polymarket historically hovering "around 30-35% in early 2026" though this appears to be an extrapolation rather than a verified data point. Notes the Goldman view is a "bullish outlier." Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three candidate classes and selects "short-horizon movements in Metaculus community medians" as most pertinent. Claims to have sampled ~200 such short-horizon meta-questions (2019-2025) showing median absolute change of ~1.2pp and ~50.7% upward direction. This statistical claim is specific and useful but potentially fabricated -- there is no way to verify this from the search results. Score: 3/4 (with caveat about unverifiable statistics).

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Lists specific upcoming data releases with dates (Feb 8 claims, Feb 9 Michigan sentiment, Feb 13 CPI). Notes none historically shift GDP-type questions by >2pp more than 25% of the time. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from 50% random walk, adds +5pp for "meta-gaming" effect (documented historical bias when meta-questions exist). Arrives at 55%. The meta-gaming adjustment is creative and plausible but the claimed documentation is unverifiable from search results. Still, it represents a real phenomenon on prediction platforms. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Derived 55% with explicit calibration arithmetic.
- Considered both pathways: random walk symmetry vs. meta-gaming tilt.
- Unique contribution: identified the meta-gaming incentive as a structural bias.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient and accurate. Correctly dismisses Canadian article. Notes the Goldman view is a quantitative outlier (20% vs others at 30-35%). Handles the agent report correctly by noting its high quality for technical access but low value for forecast content. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three candidate classes. Selects "all Metaculus binary questions where CP is in 20-35% range and horizon <=30 days." Cites specific statistics from "Kaggle 2023 dump": median change ~1.3pp, positive sign probability ~48-49%. This is more conservative than S1-4's similar claim. As with S1-4, the specific numbers are unverifiable but plausible. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 9.5-day window. Lists two data releases: January payrolls (Feb 6) and January CPI (Feb 13). Notes historical reaction magnitudes (-1 to +3pp for weak payroll, -1 to +2pp for hot CPI). Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from 48% (from reference class), then applies four adjustments: -4pp for soft-landing consensus, -1pp for CPI raising inflation not GDP worries, -3pp for information sparsity, +2pp for random noise. Net: 42%. The adjustments are clearly directional and the final number reflects a bearish view on CP drift. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Derived 42% with transparent arithmetic.
- Considered both pathways with explicit directional reasoning.
- Good point that status quo (no change) resolves to No.

- **Score:** 12/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 35% | 13/16 | Thorough source analysis with quality ratings | Aggressive downward adjustments from 50% baseline; conflates recession probability with CP drift |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 53% | 12/16 | Good insight about lower bar for single negative quarter | Less quantitative calibration; vague "slight upward bias" |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 51% | 15/16 | Most rigorous reference class analysis; intellectually honest near-coin-flip assessment | Could have quantified adjustments more precisely |
| S1-4 | o3 | 55% | 12/16 | Creative meta-gaming insight; specific statistical claims | Unverifiable historical statistics; meta-gaming effect size uncertain |
| S1-5 | o3 | 42% | 12/16 | Strong directional reasoning about soft-landing consensus | Possibly too bearish on upward drift; 48% starting point unclear why below 50% |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Prediction |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5, self) | 35% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 55% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 53% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 51% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3, self) | 42% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Categorizes evidence into Strong (declining recession probability trend, strong Q3 2025, professional consensus optimism), Moderate (mixed Q1 signals, administration optimism, labor market softening), and Weak (short-term volatility, policy uncertainty). This is systematic and well-organized. However, over-weights the CNBC survey recession probability (23%) as directly relevant to CP drift, when the question is about whether the CP moves, not whether the underlying event occurs. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 35% -> Output: 25%, Delta = -10pp. The update direction is downward, justified by: (1) CNBC survey at 23% is below current 27% CP (-10pp), (2) strong Q3 momentum (-5pp), (3) Q1 partially complete reducing uncertainty (-5pp), offset by threshold asymmetry (+5pp) and Morgan Stanley downside scenario (+5pp), short timeframe (-5pp). The arithmetic is transparent (35% - 10% - 5% - 5% + 5% + 5% - 5% = 20%, then adjusted up to 25%). However, the largest adjustment (-10pp for CNBC survey at 23%) conflates the underlying recession question with the meta-question about CP drift. Score: 2/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses halved (5 days -> ~25%) and doubled (20 days -> ~45%) timeframes. The directional reasoning is sound: shorter time favors status quo (No), longer time allows more data to accumulate. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed meaningfully: paraphrase correct, base rate stated and checked, consistency check ("25 out of 100 times"), key evidence listed with weights, blind spot identified (unexpected negative data release), status quo analysis (75% for <=27%). Score: 4/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Update direction (downward from 35% to 25%) is justified by the evidence that expert consensus recession probability (23%) is below current CP (27%), suggesting downward drift.
- However, the final 25% probability may be too low. It implies a 75% chance the CP stays at or drops below 27%, which seems overconfident given the razor-thin threshold and inherent randomness of short-term CP movements.
- Internal consistency is reasonable but the large -10pp CNBC adjustment is questionable.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Categories evidence into Strong, Moderate, and Weak tiers. Strong evidence includes recent Q3 GDP performance, institutional recession probabilities bracketing 27%, and Conference Board early-2026 warning. Moderate evidence includes weak December jobs data and Morgan Stanley's downside scenario. Correctly identifies Trump administration predictions as weak evidence. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 55% -> Output: 62%, Delta = +7pp. Adjustments: +3pp Conference Board warning, +2pp weak December jobs, +2pp JPM/CNBC estimates averaging above 27%, -2pp strong Q3 momentum, +2pp razor-thin threshold meta-gaming. The upward adjustments are mostly reasonable but the +7pp net is slightly aggressive. The claim that "JPM/CNBC institutional estimates averaging slightly above 27%" is only partially accurate -- CNBC survey is at 23%, below 27%. Score: 2/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses halved (52%) and doubled (58%) timeframes, but with an unusual directional claim: halving the timeframe would "increase probability to ~52%" -- this seems backwards. With less time, there's less chance for movement in either direction, and the probability should be closer to 50% (or slightly below given strict ">" threshold). The doubled timeframe at 58% is more plausible. Score: 2/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements present. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated (55%). Consistency check ("62 out of 100 times"). Key evidence listed. Blind spot identified (low January CPI pushing optimism). Status quo analysis present but says "~50-55% chance of any movement" which contradicts the 62% final. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Update direction (upward from 55% to 62%) is partially justified by negative recent data (weak December jobs, Conference Board warning).
- However, the claim that CNBC estimates average "slightly above 27%" is misleading when the CNBC survey itself has recession at 23%.
- The 62% may be too high given the balanced evidence environment. It implies nearly 2:1 odds that the CP rises, which is hard to justify over 10 days with mixed signals.

- **Score:** 10/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured analysis using Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong evidence: status quo + strict threshold (if CP stays 27%, outcome is No). Moderate evidence: recent expert survey recession risk around low-to-mid-20s (downward pressure), countervailing tariffs/uncertainty. Weak evidence: administration claims, immigration-driven drag. The identification of status quo as the key strong evidence favoring No is a significant analytical insight that several other forecasters missed. Score: 4/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 53% -> Output: 43%, Delta = -10pp. Adjustments: -7 to -10pp for status quo/stickiness + strict ">" threshold, -2 to -4pp for expert consensus tilting optimistic, +1 to +2pp for persistent uncertainty. The reasoning is sound: since CP staying at exactly 27.00% resolves No, there's an asymmetry that works against Yes. This is one of the best-reasoned updates in the ensemble. Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses halved (~4-5 days: more inertia, probability of >27% falls slightly) and doubled (~18-20 days: more macro releases, closer to 50/50). Directional reasoning is correct and consistent. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed. Paraphrase correct (explicitly notes "strictly greater than" and includes timestamp). Base rate stated (53%). Consistency check: "43 out of 100 times." Key evidence listed concisely. Blind spot identified (sudden negative macro shock). Status quo analysis: CP staying near 27% is plausible and implies No. Score: 4/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Update direction (downward from 53% to 43%) matches the evidence direction (optimistic consensus, status quo favoring No).
- Final probability of 43% is internally consistent with the stated reasoning: more likely than not the CP stays at or below 27%, but substantial uncertainty remains.
- Best-calibrated forecast in the ensemble for internal consistency.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but effective. Identifies that no hard data between now and Feb 14 directly informs Q1-Q3 GDP (strong evidence absent). Moderate evidence: expert surveys in 20-35% band, historical Metaculus drift ~0.2pp/day. Weak evidence: CPI and jobs data unlikely to cause major moves. Correctly notes that "recency-weighting bias" in Metaculus aggregation tends to favor slight upward moves. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 51% -> Output: 51%, Delta = 0pp. Adjustments: +2pp for expert anchors slightly above 27%, +1pp for recency-weighting bias, -1pp for expected soft jobs report. Net: +2pp from baseline 49% (random walk), arriving at 51%. This is a near-zero update from outside view, which is defensible given that the inside view sources largely confirmed rather than contradicted the outside view. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved: "even more inertia, probability falls slightly." Doubled: "one more CPI + Atlanta Fed GDPNow updates, raise Yes by ~3pp." The directional logic is correct. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements present. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated (symmetric 49%). Consistency check: "51 out of 100 times." Key evidence listed in <20 words each (concise). Blind spot: "major negative surprise (e.g., Fed nominee crisis)." Status quo: "CP usually stays flat; lean toward roughly even odds." Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Update direction is essentially neutral (51%), consistent with the evidence not strongly favoring either direction.
- Final probability reflects genuine uncertainty, which is appropriate for a short-horizon CP movement question.
- The small update from outside view (51% -> 51%) is defensible but could be seen as under-engaging with the inside view evidence.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Categorizes into Strong (multiple surveys clustering recession odds at low-to-mid-30s), Moderate (upcoming payroll/CPI releases, historical 10-day drift data), Weak (administration claims, immigration-driven drag). Correctly notes that most AskNews items are non-US or sectoral and discards them. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 42% -> Output: 37%, Delta = -5pp. Adjustments: -4pp for upbeat sell-side notes dominating sentiment since Feb 1, -2pp for payrolls consensus favoring neutral/positive print, +0pp for CPI timing (comes <24h before deadline), +1pp for noise/weekend rebalancing. The reasoning is consistent with a bearish view on upward CP drift. The -4pp for "upbeat sell-side notes" is reasonable given the Conference Board, Morgan Stanley, and Apollo all trending optimistic. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses halved (drift shrinks to ~0.9pp) and doubled (~1.8pp). Notes directional bias doesn't flip but variance grows. Concise and correct. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements present. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated (48% up-move adjusted to 42% outside view). Consistency check: "37 out of 100 times." Key evidence listed with four items. Blind spot: sudden negative shock (tech layoff wave). Status quo bias favors <=27%. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Update direction (downward from 42% to 37%) matches the evidence direction (optimistic sell-side consensus, payrolls likely neutral).
- The 37% implies roughly 2:1 odds against the CP rising above 27%, which is fairly confident given the inherent randomness.
- Internally consistent with stated reasoning.

- **Score:** 12/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 35% (S1-1) | 25% | -10pp | 12/16 | Partial -- magnitude of CNBC-based adjustment is excessive |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 55% (S1-4) | 62% | +7pp | 10/16 | Partial -- direction partly justified but timeframe sensitivity error and selective evidence weighting |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 53% (S1-2) | 43% | -10pp | 15/16 | Yes -- well-reasoned downward adjustment based on status quo asymmetry |
| S2-4 | o3 | 51% (S1-3) | 51% | 0pp | 12/16 | Yes -- minimal update justified by inside view confirming outside view |
| S2-5 | o3 | 42% (S1-5) | 37% | -5pp | 12/16 | Yes -- consistent downward adjustment based on optimistic sentiment |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4 from o3, 55%):** Engaged with the 55% base rate and moved it upward to 62%. The cross-pollinated input was from the highest outside view prediction, which included the meta-gaming insight. S2-2 built on this by adding further upward adjustments. However, the engagement was somewhat uncritical -- S2-2 did not push back on the speculative meta-gaming effect size from S1-4.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2 from Sonnet 4.5, 53%):** Strong engagement. Took the 53% base rate and moved it to 43%, a -10pp adjustment. The reasoning explicitly addressed why the inside view evidence (status quo favoring No, optimistic expert consensus) warranted a downward revision from the outside view. This was the most effective cross-pollination interaction.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3 from GPT-5.2, 51%):** Engaged with the 51% base rate and maintained it at 51%. While this could be seen as weak engagement, the reasoning explained that inside view evidence largely confirmed the outside view assessment, so a minimal update was warranted. This is a defensible position.

**Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**

S2-2 arguably over-weighted the S1-4 input by not critically examining the meta-gaming claim. S2-4 may have under-weighted the inside view evidence (CNBC survey at 23%, Conference Board warning) by maintaining 51% unchanged.

**Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**

S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving self at 35%) made the largest downward adjustment (-10pp to 25%), while S2-5 (o3 receiving self at 42%) made a moderate adjustment (-5pp to 37%). Both same-model instances moved downward, while the cross-model instances showed more varied behavior (S2-2 up, S2-3 down, S2-4 flat). This suggests cross-pollination did introduce directional diversity.

**Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**

The final spread (25% to 62% = 37pp) is wider than the outside view spread (35% to 55% = 20pp). Cross-pollination appears to have increased diversity, primarily because S2-1 pulled significantly downward and S2-2 pushed significantly upward. The cross-model instances (S2-3, S2-4) stayed more centrist (43%, 51%), while the self-model instances diverged. This is the opposite of the expected pattern where cross-pollination should promote convergence through perspective-sharing.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All five instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: the community prediction for Q41089 must be **strictly greater than** 27.00% on 2026-02-14 for Yes resolution. Several forecasters explicitly noted the strict inequality (S1-3, S2-3, S1-5).
- All correctly identified the 10-day forecast timeframe (Feb 4 to Feb 14).
- All correctly assessed the current status: community prediction at 27.00% as of Feb 1, 2026, with the question sitting exactly at the threshold.
- All correctly identified that this is a meta-question (predicting community prediction movement) rather than a direct GDP forecast.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. The Metaculus community prediction for Q41089 was 27.00% as of 2026-02-01, exactly at the resolution threshold.
2. Professional recession/negative-GDP probabilities for 2026 cluster in the 20-35% range: Goldman Sachs (20%), CNBC survey (23%), RSM (30%), JPM (35%).
3. Q3 2025 US GDP came in at 4.3% annualized, significantly above expectations, indicating strong pre-2026 momentum.
4. The question's strict ">" threshold means exactly 27.00% resolves No, creating a structural asymmetry.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 (o3) | Unverifiable statistical claim | Claims to have "sampled ~200 short-horizon meta-questions (2019-2025)" showing median absolute change ~1.2pp and 50.7% upward direction. This data cannot be verified from the search results and may be fabricated or recalled from training data. | Medium -- the statistics sound plausible and did not distort the final prediction significantly, but relying on unverifiable data is a methodology concern. |
| S1-5 (o3) | Unverifiable statistical claim | Cites "Kaggle 2023 dump" for Metaculus data showing median change ~1.3pp and 48-49% positive direction. Similar concern to S1-4. | Medium -- same concern as above. |
| S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | Misleading evidence characterization | States "JPM/CNBC institutional estimates averaging slightly above 27%" but the CNBC survey recession probability is 23%, which is below 27%. Only JPM at 35% is above. | Medium -- this incorrect characterization contributed to an upward adjustment (+2pp) that was not fully justified. |
| S1-4 (o3) | Unverifiable claim about Polymarket | States "historically such Polymarket markets have hovered around 30-35% in early 2026" without this being in the search results. | Low -- the claim is plausible but not verified from the provided sources. |

### Hallucinations

S1-4 and S1-5 both cite specific statistical claims about historical Metaculus CP drift patterns that cannot be verified from the search results provided. While these may reflect genuine knowledge from training data, they represent a form of unverifiable claim injection. The specific numbers (1.2pp vs 1.3pp, 50.7% vs 48-49%) differ between the two instances, suggesting they are approximations rather than precise retrievals.

S1-4's claim about "documented meta-gaming bias" with a +5pp effect size is particularly concerning as a potential hallucination, since no documentation of this effect was surfaced in the search results. However, the phenomenon (users manipulating underlying predictions when meta-questions exist) is real and has been discussed in the forecasting community.

No outright fabricated facts, dates, or sources were detected.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Correct meta-question comprehension**: All five forecasters correctly identified this as a prediction about community prediction movement rather than a direct GDP forecast, and appropriately framed their analysis around CP drift dynamics rather than macroeconomic fundamentals.
2. **Strong source analysis in outside view**: The ensemble collectively surfaced a useful range of institutional recession probabilities (20-35%) and correctly identified the current CP (27%) as sitting within the expert consensus band, providing a solid foundation for the forecast.
3. **S2-3 (GPT-5.2) produced an exceptional analysis**: The best individual output correctly identified the status quo asymmetry (CP staying at 27.00% resolves No), applied the Strong/Moderate/Weak evidence framework effectively, and produced an internally consistent 43% prediction that is well-calibrated for this question type.

### Weaknesses
1. **Excessive ensemble spread (37pp)**: The range from 25% to 62% indicates fundamental disagreement about how to model short-horizon CP drift. This disagreement stems from different starting assumptions (random walk vs. expert-driven drift) and different weighting of the meta-gaming effect, not from different evidence interpretation. The simple average (43.6%) papers over this divergence.
2. **Failed agentic search wasted budget**: The historical research agentic search spent all seven steps trying to access Q41089 via unauthenticated web scraping when the bot has an API token. This was the most valuable possible data source (actual CP trajectory) and its absence weakened all five forecasters' ability to ground their predictions in empirical CP volatility data.
3. **Conflation of underlying event probability with CP drift probability**: Several forecasters (especially S2-1 and S2-5) treated the CNBC survey's 23% recession probability as direct evidence for the direction of CP movement, rather than recognizing that what matters is whether forecasters will update the CP upward, which depends on whether this information is already incorporated into the current 27% prediction.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B-**

The ensemble demonstrated solid comprehension of the meta-question structure and produced individually competent analyses, but the excessive spread (37pp), failed agentic search, and conflation of underlying event probability with CP drift dynamics prevent a higher grade. The final prediction of 43.6% is reasonable for this genuinely difficult question, but the path to that number was uneven. S2-3's 43% stands out as the best-calibrated individual prediction with the strongest reasoning.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Use authenticated API for Metaculus meta-questions**: When the question involves predicting community prediction movement, the bot should query the Metaculus API (using its existing token) to retrieve the current CP value and recent trajectory for the target question. This is the single most valuable data source for this question type and was entirely missed.
2. **Add economic data calendar queries**: For short-horizon meta-questions about economic indicators, include a query specifically targeting upcoming scheduled data releases (e.g., "US economic data releases February 2026 calendar") to help forecasters assess whether catalyst events fall within the prediction window.
3. **Filter irrelevant AskNews results**: The AskNews query returned numerous irrelevant international articles (Italian GDP, Romanian GDP, Brazilian politics). The query should be more specific to US economic data or the AskNews results should be filtered for relevance before being passed to forecasters.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Add guidance for meta-questions**: The prompts should include specific guidance for "community prediction rises" questions, emphasizing that the key question is about CP drift dynamics rather than the underlying event probability. Forecasters should be instructed to distinguish between "what should the probability be?" and "will the community prediction move upward?"
2. **Consider spread-aware aggregation**: When the ensemble spread exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30pp for binary), consider using median instead of mean, or applying a trimmed mean to reduce the influence of outlier predictions.
3. **Add status quo framing for threshold questions**: For questions where the current value is exactly at or near the resolution threshold, the prompt should explicitly note that "no change" resolves to a specific outcome (in this case, No), as this is a critical framing that some forecasters missed.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-1, S2-2)**: Produced the widest divergence in the ensemble (25% and 62%). S2-1 was too aggressive in its downward adjustment (-10pp), while S2-2 was too aggressive upward (+7pp). Both would benefit from more conservative update magnitudes and explicit cross-checking against the base rate.
- **GPT-5.2 (S2-3)**: Strongest individual performance. The status quo asymmetry insight was the most analytically valuable contribution. No model-specific improvements needed.
- **o3 (S2-4, S2-5)**: Both produced reasonable middle-ground predictions (51%, 37%). However, both cited unverifiable historical statistics about Metaculus CP drift patterns. The pipeline should either validate such claims or instruct models to note when they are citing recalled knowledge vs. sourced evidence.
