# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Inconsistent interpretation of Google Trends current value | Medium | S1-1, S1-2, S2-2 | Some forecasters cite Feb 4 current value as 9, others as 15 (Feb 1 value); S2-2 appears confused about whether Feb 5 will start elevated or at baseline, leading to divergent predictions. The question background states Feb 1 = 15, but the Google Trends data pull shows current value = 9, 7-day avg = 27.9. Different forecasters anchor on different figures. |
| Conflicting base rate interpretation across S1 outputs | Medium | S1-1, S1-2 vs S1-3, S1-4, S1-5 | S1-1 and S1-2 adjusted the 43% "Doesn't change" base rate significantly upward (to 51% and 61%) arguing post-spike stabilization, while S1-3 stuck closely to the raw base rate (43%), and S1-4/S1-5 stayed near it (41-42%). The 18pp gap between S1-2 and S1-4 on "Doesn't change" reveals disagreement about whether to adjust the base rate for context in the outside view. |
| S2-2 shifts strongly toward "Decreases" without strong justification for magnitude | Medium | S2-2 | S2-2 moved from S1-4's base rate (29/41/30 Incr/NC/Decr) to 23/35/42 -- a 12pp increase in "Decreases" and 6pp decrease in "Doesn't change." The written reasoning argues the Feb 5 value may still be elevated, but the Google Trends data shows current value at 9 (already at baseline), which undermines the decay hypothesis. The magnitude of shift seems disproportionate to the evidence. |
| Fabricated historical statistics in S1-5 and S2-5 | High | S1-5, S2-5 | S1-5 claims "empirical base rate (derived from 18,000 windows, 2020-25)" and S2-5 cites "GT data for 50 comparable senator-announcement spikes (2021-25) show mean delta -6 points over the 2nd-9th day." These statistics were not present in any research artifact and appear to be hallucinated to lend false precision to the analysis. |
| Insufficient attention to resolution URL rescaling | Low | All | The question specifies a fixed-date URL (Jan 13 - Feb 12) for resolution. The relative nature of Google Trends means values on this fixed URL may differ from the live 90-day data the forecasters anchored on. No forecaster seriously analyzed how the fixed-date windowing might affect the comparison values. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. `amy klobuchar schedule feb 2026` (Google)
2. `amy klobuchar february 2026 senate hearing` (Google News)
3. `Check if any planned major announcement, TV appearance, or investigation expected for Amy Klobuchar between Feb 5-12 2026. Highlight anything that would elevate national coverage.` (Agent)
4. `amy klobuchar` (Google Trends)

**Current Queries:**
1. `Amy Klobuchar upcoming events 2026` (Google)
2. `Amy Klobuchar Feb 2026 news` (Google News)
3. `What major appearances or announcements involving Senator Amy Klobuchar are scheduled or expected in the United States between February 5 and February 12 2026?` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Forward-looking (Feb 5-12 events); also 90-day trends data | Forward-looking (Feb 5-12 events + recent news context) |
| Content type | Senate calendar, scheduled events, Google Trends baseline data | News coverage, political events, campaign developments |
| Unique contribution | Google Trends base rate data (critical); agent report on scheduled events; Senate committee assignments | AskNews articles with detailed coverage of Jan 22-Feb 4 news cycle; caucus coverage; polling data |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are somewhat overlapping in intent (both seek information about upcoming Klobuchar events) but diverge in sources and content retrieved. The historical queries successfully retrieved the Google Trends base rate data (43% no-change rate) which became the backbone of every forecaster's analysis. The agent report was particularly valuable, providing a thorough scan of scheduled events.
- The current queries surfaced rich contextual information: Klobuchar's gubernatorial announcement (Jan 29), caucus coverage (Feb 3), polling data (14-point lead), synthetic DNA bill (Feb 4), and ICE testimony coverage. These gave forecasters substantial material for the inside view.
- The historical queries correctly targeted base rate establishment through the Google Trends data pull and calendar event scanning.
- The current queries surfaced recent decision-relevant events, particularly the Feb 3 caucuses and Feb 4 news items that could affect the Feb 5 starting value.
- **Critical information gap**: Neither query set attempted to retrieve historical Google Trends patterns for comparable political figures' post-announcement decay curves, which would have been more informative than the generic 12-day window base rate. The query generator partially compensated by including analysis of the 90-day data in the historical query output, providing a useful statistical foundation.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs generally remained factual rather than providing probability estimates. The query_historical.md output did include a substantive analysis paragraph stating "the outside view favors 'Doesn't change'" and noting that one-day moves of +/-4 points "occurred in only about 20% of the 89 one-day changes" -- this blurs the line between research and forecasting. However, this information was useful context rather than harmful. The agent report concluded with a directional assessment ("expectations... should remain low") but framed it as an assessment rather than a probability forecast. The AskNews articles and article summaries were appropriately factual.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** Google Trends base rate (43% no-change in 12-day windows); Klobuchar gubernatorial announcement Jan 29; absence of scheduled events Feb 5-12; Feb 3 caucus coverage; current Google Trends value of 9 (near 90-day mean of 8.9); recent 7-day average of 27.9 showing post-announcement elevation; polling data showing 14-point lead; synthetic DNA bill co-sponsorship on Feb 4.
- **Critical information missed:** No historical comparison to similar political figures' post-announcement Google Trends decay curves; no analysis of how the fixed-date URL (Jan 13 - Feb 12) would rescale values relative to the 90-day pull; no attempt to estimate the likely Feb 5 value on the resolution URL specifically.
- **Source quality:** High overall. Government documents, AP/Reuters wire stories, major national outlets (NBC, NPR, CNN, Fox News), and reputable regional outlets (Star Tribune, CBS Minnesota). The Google Trends data pull was the most critical source and was appropriately utilized.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough categorization of all sources by type (government documents, news articles, agent report, Google Trends data). Correctly assessed reliability levels and distinguished between factual content and expert opinion (e.g., Matt Dallek's analysis). Identified the 6-day age of the announcement articles as relevant context. Score: 4/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three candidate reference classes (post-announcement decay, generic politician Google Trends behavior, senator-to-governor patterns) and evaluated each with suitability ratings. Selected "post-announcement decay for political candidacy launches" as most suitable, with clear justification. This choice is reasonable though it mixes outside and inside view information (knowing about the specific announcement). Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated the 8-day prediction window and provided a detailed timeline from Jan 29 through Feb 12. Identified the key insight that both measurement dates fall in the post-spike decay phase. Noted the rapid decline from 15 to 9 between Feb 1 and Feb 4. However, the analysis could have more explicitly addressed whether the 12-day base rate window approximates the 7-day comparison window adequately. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Started from the 43% base rate for "Doesn't change" and adjusted upward to 51% based on the argument that the base rate includes periods with events while the forecast period has none. Allocated 31% to "Decreases" and 18% to "Increases." The logic is sound but the magnitude of the upward adjustment (43% to 51%) could be better justified with quantitative reasoning. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Assigned probabilities to all three options: 18% / 51% / 31%.
- Considered correlations between options implicitly (noting that factors favoring one reduce another).
- Probabilities sum to 100%.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Similar quality to S1-1 with thorough categorization. Correctly identified the agent report's conclusion and the Google Trends data discrepancy between Feb 1 value (15) and Feb 4 value (9). Appropriate assessment of source reliability. Score: 4/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified four candidate classes (post-announcement decay, senator gubernatorial campaigns, Minnesota political figures, 12-day Google Trends windows). Selected a combination of post-announcement decay and empirical 12-day base rates. The combined approach is well-justified. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified the 8-day window. Provided a three-phase model of post-announcement dynamics (immediate spike days 0-3, rapid decay days 4-7, return to baseline days 8-14) and placed the current date within it. This structured approach is valuable. Score: 4/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Adjusted significantly upward from 43% base to 61% for "Doesn't change," reasoning that the 57% change rate includes periods with catalysts while this period has none. This is a substantial adjustment (+18pp) that risks overconfidence in stability. The reasoning is directionally correct but the magnitude may be excessive given that random Google Trends noise alone could produce >3 point changes even without news events. Score: 2/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Assigned probabilities to all three options: 18% / 61% / 21%.
- Probabilities sum to 100%.
- The high "Doesn't change" probability (61%) is the most aggressive of all S1 outputs.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but effective. Correctly identified the key factual take-away from each source type. Distinguished between facts and opinions for each. Appropriately flagged the agent report as "secondhand and explicitly uncertain" while still using it directionally. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three candidates and selected the term's own historical 12-day window behavior as primary, with post-announcement decay as a qualitative modifier. This is a disciplined choice that stays closer to the outside view by not over-weighting the specific announcement context. Score: 4/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly noted the 7-day separation and acknowledged the base rate uses ~12-day windows as an approximation. Analysis is accurate but briefer than other outputs. Score: 3/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchored tightly to the 43/29/28 split from base rate data, then applied a modest 20% shrinkage toward uniform prior to account for small-sample uncertainty. Final: 22/43/35. The Bayesian approach to shrinkage is methodologically sound. The direction of the split (slightly favoring "Decreases") is justified by the post-spike decay pattern but kept modest for the outside view. Score: 4/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Assigned probabilities to all three options: 22% / 43% / 35%.
- Probabilities sum to 100%.
- The closest to the empirical base rate of all outputs, showing disciplined anchoring.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient but less detailed than others. Correctly summarized each source category but with minimal elaboration. The assessment is accurate but less thorough. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Proposed three classes and selected "8-day change in Google Trends value for a sitting U.S. senator over the last several years." Claims to derive base rates from "18,000 windows, 2020-25" -- this specific statistic was not present in any research artifact and appears to be fabricated/hallucinated. The base rates cited (43/29/28) happen to match the provided data, but the claimed provenance is false. Score: 2/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Brief but accurate. Correctly noted that mean reversion after a news spike is common, citing "roughly 55% of post-spike windows show net declines" -- another statistic that appears unsourced and potentially fabricated. Score: 2/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Applied a mild downward bias (+7pp to Decreases, -7pp to Increases) from the base rate. Final: 29/41/30. The adjustments are moderate and directionally sensible. But the use of fabricated statistics to justify the direction reduces confidence in the methodology. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Assigned probabilities to all three options: 29% / 41% / 30%.
- Probabilities sum to 100%.
- The near-symmetric split between Increases and Decreases is distinctive among S1 outputs.

- **Score:** 10/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and accurate. Six sources categorized with quality assessments. Correctly flagged opinions as non-predictive for search volume. Score: 3/4.

- **Reference Class Selection:** Selected "8-day change in Google Trends value for a sitting U.S. senator over the last several years." Same as S1-4, also claims to derive base rates from "18,000 windows, 2020-25" which is a fabricated statistic. Uses the same base rates (43/29/28). Score: 2/4.

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Brief but adequate. Notes that the Jan 29 spike is six days old by Feb 4 and that Feb 5 baseline may still be elevated relative to long-run mean. Cites "current GT value approximately 15 versus 90-day mean 9" but this conflates the Feb 1 value with the Feb 4 value. The Google Trends data showed Feb 4 current value at 9, not 15. Score: 2/4.

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Applied +7pp to "Decreases," -7pp to "Increases" from the base rate, yielding 22/42/36. Justified by "mild downward bias (mean reversion probability +7 pp toward 'Decreases')." The adjustment is moderate and reasonable in direction. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Assigned probabilities to all three options: 22% / 42% / 36%.
- Probabilities sum to 100%.

- **Score:** 10/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (I/NC/D) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 18/51/31 | 13/16 | Thorough source analysis; clear timeline construction | Reference class selection mixes outside/inside view |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 18/61/21 | 13/16 | Excellent three-phase decay model; strong timeframe analysis | Overly aggressive upward adjustment of "Doesn't change" to 61% |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 22/43/35 | 14/16 | Most disciplined base rate anchoring; Bayesian shrinkage methodology | Briefer analysis than some peers |
| S1-4 | o3 | 29/41/30 | 10/16 | Moderate, balanced adjustments | Hallucinated "18,000 windows" statistic |
| S1-5 | o3 | 22/42/36 | 10/16 | Reasonable direction of adjustment | Hallucinated statistics; conflated Feb 1 and Feb 4 values |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (I/NC/D) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5, self) | 18/51/31 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 29/41/30 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 18/61/21 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 22/43/35 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (o3, self) | 22/42/36 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Comprehensive application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong evidence: rapid decay pattern (15->9), no scheduled events, precinct caucuses timing (before window). Moderate evidence: state-level race (less sustained interest), baseline stabilization, uncommitted caucus votes. Weak evidence: synthetic DNA bill, Rahman testimony. Well-structured and clearly categorized. Score: 4/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 18/51/31 -> Output: 12/58/30, Delta = -6/+7/-1. The shift reduces "Increases" by 6pp and increases "Doesn't change" by 7pp. Justified by three strong pieces of evidence: (1) precinct caucuses already occurred before window, (2) rapid decay suggests equilibrium reached, (3) no events scheduled. The direction is consistent with evidence but the magnitude of the "Doesn't change" increase (to 58%) may be aggressive given the 43% empirical base rate. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses halved and doubled timeframe scenarios with specific probability adjustments for each. Halved: 60% no change. Doubled: 40% no change. This is thorough and well-reasoned. Score: 4/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All six elements completed substantively: paraphrase (correct), base rate alignment (stated and compared), consistency check (most/least likely aligned), key evidence listed (5 items), blind spot identified (unexpected viral moment), and probability technicalities verified. Score: 4/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Updates preserve probability sum = 100% (12 + 58 + 30 = 100).
- Relative adjustments: "Increases" reduced most (-6pp), "Doesn't change" increased most (+7pp), "Decreases" roughly stable (-1pp). This makes sense given the evidence points to stability rather than continued decline.
- Most affected option identified: "Increases" reduced due to caucuses being pre-window and no catalysts.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses Strong/Moderate/Weak framework with clear categorization. Two strong evidence items (launch spike occurred, no scheduled events), three moderate items, two weak items. The analysis explicitly walks through net adjustments with specific percentage point changes for each piece of evidence. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 29/41/30 -> Output: 23/35/42, Delta = -6/-6/+12. A large shift toward "Decreases" (+12pp). The justification is the "post-announcement decay pattern" and measurement window positioning. However, the Google Trends data shows the current value at 9, which is already at the 90-day baseline of 8.9. If Feb 5 is already at baseline, the "decay" story is significantly weakened. The forecaster acknowledges this uncertainty in their blind spot analysis but still commits to a high "Decreases" probability. The 12pp shift is the largest single-option update among all S2 outputs. Score: 2/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Provides specific probability adjustments for halved (4 days) and doubled (16 days) scenarios. Halved: 25/40/35. Doubled: 15/25/60. These are internally consistent with the decay thesis. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Paraphrase correct, base rate stated (29/41/30), consistency verified (most likely = Decrease at 42%), key evidence listed, blind spot identified (uncertainty about Feb 5 starting value). Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Updates preserve probability sum = 100% (23 + 35 + 42 = 100).
- Relative adjustments: "Decreases" became the plurality winner, flipping from third-highest to first. This is a significant structural change from the S1 input.
- Most affected option: "Decreases" (+12pp) driven by decay hypothesis.
- The forecaster explicitly acknowledges their own blind spot: "If Feb 5 has already declined to near-baseline, then 'No change' becomes more likely." This self-awareness is commendable but should have led to a more hedged final probability.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured analysis distinguishing strong, moderate, and weak evidence. Key finding: fresh Feb 3-4 news cycle (caucuses + Reuters bill) may keep searches modestly elevated into Feb 5, then fade by Feb 12. This is a nuanced insight that connects the inside view evidence to the specific resolution mechanics. Score: 4/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 18/61/21 -> Output: 16/55/29, Delta = -2/-6/+8. A modest shift from the already high "Doesn't change" base toward "Decreases." The justification is well-articulated: Feb 3-4 coverage may elevate Feb 5, creating a higher starting point that then decays. The magnitude is moderate and well-reasoned. Score: 3/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses halved and doubled windows with directional predictions. Concise but adequate. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Six-item checklist completed. Resolution criteria paraphrased correctly. Base rate stated (18/61/21). Consistency verified. Key evidence summarized in under 20 words each (nicely disciplined). Blind spot: major ICE confrontation near Feb 11-12. Technicalities confirmed. Score: 4/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Updates preserve probability sum = 100% (16 + 55 + 29 = 100).
- Relative adjustments sensible: "Doesn't change" reduced modestly (-6pp) while "Decreases" increased (+8pp), reflecting the Feb 3-4 coverage bump insight.
- Most affected option: "Decreases" driven by "elevated Feb 5 then reversion" thesis.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses Strong/Moderate/Weak framework effectively. Strong: historical decay, no scheduled triggers. Moderate: continuing news coverage, caucus-night buzz. Weak: social media controversies, unpredictable ICE incidents. Identifies the net evidence weight as "downward pressure from mean reversion is strong." Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 22/43/35 -> Output: 20/35/45, Delta = -2/-8/+10. A significant shift toward "Decreases" (+10pp) at the expense of "Doesn't change" (-8pp). The reasoning cites "post-spike mean reversion: launch + caucuses have already peaked; search interest usually falls by >=40% within a week for comparable U.S-senator announcements." The 40% decay claim is unsourced and likely fabricated, consistent with the pattern from S1-4. Despite this, the directional reasoning is sound. Score: 2/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but present. Notes halved window would increase "Doesn't change" by ~7pp and decrease "Decreases." Doubled window would increase "Decreases" by +8pp. Adequate. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed in abridged form. All six elements present. Blind spot: unforeseen viral confrontation. Consistent with stated reasoning. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Updates preserve probability sum = 100% (20 + 35 + 45 = 100).
- "Decreases" becomes the plurality winner at 45%, flipping from S1-3's "Doesn't change" lead.
- Most affected: "Doesn't change" reduced by 8pp, "Decreases" increased by 10pp.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured with Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Strong: historical decay, no scheduled triggers. Moderate: caucus coverage fading, Reuters bill. Weak: social media, ICE incidents. Net assessment: downward pressure strong. Score: 3/4.

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 22/42/36 -> Output: 17/38/45, Delta = -5/-4/+9. Shifts toward "Decreases" by 9pp. Justification: "+9 pp to Decrease -- post-announcement decay pattern & absence of new triggers. -4 pp to No change -- because most decay episodes exceed the +/-3-point band. -5 pp to Increase -- lack of planned visibility." Cites fabricated statistic: "GT data for 50 comparable senator-announcement spikes (2021-25) show mean delta -6 points." Score: 2/4.

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief: halved window increases "Doesn't change" by ~7pp; doubled window increases "Decreases" by +8pp. Adequate but minimal. Score: 3/4.

- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed in abridged form. All elements present. Blind spot: unexpected high-profile ICE incident. Consistent with reasoning. Score: 3/4.

**Question-type-specific assessment (multiple choice):**
- Updates preserve probability sum = 100% (17 + 38 + 45 = 100).
- "Decreases" becomes plurality at 45%.
- Most affected: "Increases" reduced by 5pp, "Decreases" increased by 9pp.

- **Score:** 11/16

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4/o3):** S2-2 received S1-4's relatively balanced prediction (29/41/30) and shifted it significantly toward "Decreases" (23/35/42). The o3 outside view was more balanced between Increases and Decreases, but Sonnet 4.5's inside view analysis pushed strongly toward decay. S2-2 did engage meaningfully with the S1-4 input, using it as a base rate and then applying its own evidence analysis. However, the engagement was somewhat formulaic -- the arithmetic adjustment breakdown ("+10% to Decrease" etc.) suggests mechanical updating rather than deep integration.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2/Sonnet 4.5):** S2-3 received S1-2's high "Doesn't change" prediction (18/61/21) and modestly reduced it (16/55/29). This is the most measured cross-model update. GPT-5.2 explicitly noted the Feb 3-4 news cycle as a reason Feb 5 might be temporarily elevated, a nuanced insight that was absent from S1-2. The cross-pollination worked well here -- GPT-5.2 found genuine new information to refine the Sonnet 4.5 outside view.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3/GPT-5.2):** S2-4 received S1-3's disciplined base-rate-anchored prediction (22/43/35) and shifted substantially toward "Decreases" (20/35/45). The o3 model's tendency to fabricate supporting statistics is evident, but the directional reasoning (post-announcement decay) is appropriate. The cross-pollination is somewhat undermined by the o3 model's inclination to override the input with its own narrative.

**Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):**

- **S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 self):** Made conservative adjustments from its own S1-1 input (+7pp to "Doesn't change"). The self-model pairing produced the least dramatic update, as expected. The final 58% for "Doesn't change" is the most stable-leaning prediction.

- **S2-5 (o3 self):** Made moderate adjustments from S1-5 (+9pp to "Decreases"). Like S2-4, relied on fabricated statistics. The same-model pairing for o3 did not moderate its hallucination tendency.

**Overall effectiveness:** Cross-pollination had a mild diversifying effect. The S2 outputs split into two camps: Sonnet 4.5 (S2-1) and GPT-5.2 (S2-3) favored "Doesn't change" as the plurality outcome, while the o3-influenced outputs (S2-4, S2-5) and the Sonnet 4.5 receiving o3 (S2-2) favored "Decreases." Cross-pollination did not increase overall diversity -- rather, it channeled forecasters into two interpretive camps, which is a reasonable outcome reflecting genuine analytical uncertainty.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All five instances correctly understood that the question compares Google Trends values for "amy klobuchar" on Feb 5 vs Feb 12 using a fixed-date URL.
- All correctly identified the +/-3 threshold for resolution.
- All accurately identified the forecast timeframe (8 days from Feb 5 to Feb 12).
- All correctly assessed the current political context (Klobuchar's Jan 29 gubernatorial announcement, ICE issues, caucuses).
- However, there was inconsistency in identifying the current Google Trends value: some cited 9 (the Feb 4 value from the data pull), some cited 15 (the Feb 1 value from the question background). Both are correct for their respective dates, but forecasters should have been clearer about which date they were referencing.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Klobuchar announced her gubernatorial candidacy on January 29, 2026, after Gov. Tim Walz dropped out.
2. The Google Trends 90-day mean for "amy klobuchar" is approximately 8.9, and the base rate for "Doesn't change" in 12-day windows is 43%.
3. No major scheduled events (TV appearances, rallies, hearings, investigations) were confirmed for the Feb 5-12 window.
4. The Feb 3 precinct caucuses occurred before the prediction window and represented the most recent significant political event.
5. The announcement spike had already begun decaying by Feb 4, with current values near the long-term baseline.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Fabricated statistics | Claims "empirical base rate (derived from 18,000 windows, 2020-25)" -- no such dataset existed in the research artifacts | Medium -- the base rates cited (43/29/28) happen to match the provided data, so the actual forecast was not distorted |
| S1-5 | Fabricated statistics | Same fabricated "18,000 windows" claim as S1-4 | Medium -- same reasoning |
| S2-5 | Fabricated statistics | Claims "GT data for 50 comparable senator-announcement spikes (2021-25) show mean delta -6 points" -- this specific statistic was not in any research artifact | High -- this was used to justify the directional shift toward "Decreases" |
| S2-4 | Fabricated statistics | Claims "search interest usually falls by >=40% within a week for comparable U.S-senator announcements" -- unsourced | Medium -- used to support pre-existing decay thesis |
| S1-5 | Data point confusion | States "current GT value approximately 15 versus 90-day mean 9" -- conflating Feb 1 value (15) with Feb 4 value (9) | Low -- does not significantly affect prediction |

### Hallucinations

Both o3 instances (Forecasters 4 and 5) consistently generated fabricated statistics to support their analyses. Specifically:
- The "18,000 windows, 2020-25" dataset does not exist in any provided artifact.
- The "50 comparable senator-announcement spikes" dataset is fabricated.
- The "mean delta -6 points" statistic is fabricated.
- The "55% of post-spike windows show net declines" statistic is fabricated.
- The ">=40% within a week" decay rate is fabricated.

These are not trivially wrong estimates; they are presented as empirical findings from specific datasets that were never provided. This is a systematic issue with the o3 model instances in this forecast. Notably, the fabricated statistics generally pointed in the same direction as legitimate reasoning (post-announcement decay), so the practical impact on the final forecast was limited but the methodological integrity is compromised.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong research foundation:** The Google Trends base rate data (43% no-change in 12-day windows) was effectively surfaced and became the anchor for all forecasters. The agent report's thorough scan of scheduled events was well-utilized across all outputs.
2. **Nuanced timing analysis:** Multiple forecasters (particularly S2-1 and S2-3) recognized the critical timing insight: the Feb 3 caucuses occurred before the prediction window, meaning any spike would already be captured in the Feb 5 starting value. This demonstrated sophisticated understanding of the resolution mechanics.
3. **Reasonable final aggregation:** The weighted average (17.6% / 44.2% / 38.2%) produces a sensible distribution that appropriately places "Doesn't change" as the modal outcome while allocating substantial probability to "Decreases," reflecting the legitimate post-announcement decay concern. The ensemble averaging effectively dampened individual forecaster biases.

### Weaknesses
1. **Systematic hallucination by o3 instances:** Forecasters 4 and 5 fabricated multiple statistics with false precision (exact dataset sizes, specific percentage figures) that were not present in any research artifact. While the directional impact was limited, this undermines trust in the reasoning chain.
2. **Wide disagreement on "Doesn't change" probability:** The 23pp spread (35% to 58%) reveals that forecasters fundamentally disagreed about whether to anchor on the base rate or aggressively adjust upward. This disagreement stems from different interpretations of whether the current value (9) represents genuine baseline stabilization or still-elevated post-announcement interest.
3. **Insufficient analysis of resolution URL mechanics:** The question resolves using a specific fixed-date URL (Jan 13 - Feb 12), which means all Google Trends values are scaled relative to the peak within that window. The Jan 29 announcement spike is likely the peak, which would compress all other values toward the low end of the scale. No forecaster analyzed how this rescaling might affect the +/-3 point threshold. This is a meaningful analytical gap.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

Justification: The forecast demonstrates good research quality, thoughtful base rate anchoring, and nuanced timing analysis. The final aggregated prediction is reasonable and well-calibrated. However, the systematic hallucination of statistics by the o3 instances (affecting 2 of 5 forecasters) and the lack of resolution URL mechanics analysis prevent an A grade. The core reasoning across the ensemble is intact, the aggregation dampens individual weaknesses, and the final distribution is defensible.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add a query specifically targeting post-announcement Google Trends decay patterns for comparable political figures (e.g., "Google Trends decay after political announcement site:reddit.com OR site:fivethirtyeight.com").
- Include a direct analysis of how the fixed-date resolution URL window (Jan 13 - Feb 12) rescales values relative to the peak. This could be done by requesting the verification URL's data directly.
- When the question involves comparing two future dates, explicitly estimate the likely value at the start date (Feb 5) using recent trajectory data, rather than leaving it ambiguous.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Add explicit instructions in the outside view prompt to distinguish between statistics provided in the research artifacts and statistics the model generates from its own training data. A line such as "Only cite statistics that appear in the provided sources; if you estimate from your own knowledge, clearly label it as an estimate" would help prevent hallucinations.
- For Google Trends questions, consider adding a pipeline step that retrieves the resolution URL's current data to provide forecasters with the exact scale they should be reasoning about.
- Consider adding a "starting value estimation" sub-task before the main forecast, to reduce disagreement about what the Feb 5 anchor point will be.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **o3 (Forecasters 4 and 5):** The model consistently fabricates empirical statistics with false provenance. This is a known tendency that should be addressed through prompt engineering (e.g., "Do not cite specific datasets or statistics unless they appear in the provided sources") or through post-hoc verification. Despite this, o3's directional reasoning about post-announcement decay was sound.
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1 and 2):** Produced the highest-quality structured analysis with the best evidence frameworks. However, showed a tendency to aggressively adjust the base rate upward for "Doesn't change" (51% and 61% in S1, vs 43% base rate). This may reflect overconfidence in stability.
- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** The strongest individual performer across both steps. Showed the most disciplined base rate anchoring in S1 (Bayesian shrinkage) and the most nuanced inside view insight in S2 (Feb 3-4 coverage potentially elevating Feb 5). This model's outputs should potentially receive higher weight.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (multiple choice) | Yes | "Doesn't change" ranges 35%-58% (23pp spread); "Decreases" ranges 29%-45% (16pp spread) |
| Update direction errors | No | All S2 outputs shifted in plausible directions given the inside view evidence |
| Factual errors present | Yes | Fabricated statistics in S1-4, S1-5, S2-4, S2-5 (o3 instances) |
| Hallucinations detected | Yes | Multiple fabricated datasets and statistics by o3 instances (see Section 5) |
