## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agentic search failed to retrieve actual FRED data | Medium | Research | The agentic search for historical DGS2 data returned procedural instructions on how to download data rather than the actual data values, leaving the ensemble without a complete historical time series for volatility calibration |
| S1-3 (GPT-5.2) wider distribution than warranted by stated reasoning | Medium | S1-3 | GPT-5.2 produced a 10th-90th range of 45bp (3.33-3.78) despite identifying the same stable regime as other forecasters; this is roughly double the width others used |
| CPI date discrepancy across forecasters | Low | S2-3, S2-5 | Forecaster 5 (S2-5) references "CPI release Feb 10" as a key catalyst, while the question background notes CPI is due Feb 13. Forecaster 3 (S2-3) does not mention it. This inconsistency suggests potential hallucination of the CPI date |
| o3 forecasters (S2-4, S2-5) produced substantially wider distributions than Sonnet forecasters | Medium | S2-4, S2-5 | The o3 models produced 10th-90th ranges of 50bp and 47bp respectively vs. 22bp and 22bp for the Sonnet models, creating a bimodal ensemble where effective uncertainty depends heavily on model identity |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. "US 2-year Treasury yield Jan 2026 trend" (Google)
2. "Fed DGS2 2026 daily yield data" (Google News)
3. "Retrieve FRED DGS2 series daily values from Oct 2025 to Feb 2026 and summarize recent levels" (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. "2-year Treasury yield forecast 2026" (Google)
2. "US two-year Treasury yield latest data" (Google News)
3. "Articles on recent moves in the U.S. 2-year Treasury yield and trader expectations for Fed rate cuts in February 2026" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Oct 2025-Feb 2026 trend data, recent daily values | Latest market data, near-term outlook and catalysts |
| Content type | Raw data retrieval, level/trend establishment | News articles, expert commentary, market dynamics |
| Unique contribution | Establishes the base level (3.53-3.57%) and recent volatility regime | Surfaces auction schedule, ISM surprise, Warsh nomination, delayed payrolls |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries correctly targeted the establishment of recent levels and trends, while current queries surfaced near-term catalysts and market sentiment. The separation between "what is the current state" (historical) and "what might change it" (current) is appropriate for this short-horizon forecast.
- Historical queries successfully established that DGS2 was at 3.52-3.57% in late January/early February 2026, and had declined ~50bp since October 2025. However, query 2 ("Fed DGS2 2026 daily yield data") returned no results, and the agentic search (query 3) failed to retrieve the actual FRED data, instead returning procedural instructions. This means the ensemble lacked a clean daily time series for volatility computation.
- Current queries surfaced several decision-relevant events: the ISM Manufacturing surprise (52.6 vs 48.4 expected), Treasury refunding auctions scheduled Feb 10-12, the Kevin Warsh Fed Chair nomination, and the delayed payrolls report due to government shutdown.
- **Critical gap:** No query explicitly targeted the upcoming CPI release schedule or the specific economic calendar for Feb 5-12. Several forecasters mentioned CPI with conflicting dates (Feb 10 vs Feb 13), suggesting they relied on model knowledge rather than verified search results.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs are largely factual. The Schwab outlook and J.P. Morgan "realistic surprise" article contain forward-looking opinion, but these are appropriately labeled as expert/speculative views rather than presented as definitive forecasts. The AskNews articles include commentary from BMO's Ian Lyngen ("range-bound in February") and FWDBONDS' Chris Rupkey, which are expert opinions that could be interpreted as implicit forecasts. However, overall the research pipeline maintained a reasonable boundary between fact and opinion.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** Current DGS2 level (3.56-3.57%), recent stability (3.52-3.61% range over two weeks), ISM Manufacturing surprise, Treasury refunding auction schedule, Warsh nomination, delayed payrolls, absence of near-term FOMC meeting
- **Critical information missed:** Precise economic calendar for Feb 5-12 (CPI date was inconsistently cited by forecasters), actual historical volatility statistics from the time series (agentic search failed to retrieve data), forward rate market pricing for the 2-year, options-implied volatility
- **Source quality:** High for market data sources (YCharts, CNBC, Hexun, MoneyDJ); medium-high for outlook pieces (Schwab, J.P. Morgan); the Treasury methodology page was informative but not predictive. The AskNews deep research failed due to API rate limits.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all four sources with clear quality assessments. Correctly identified that the CNBC quote tracks a specific security rather than the constant maturity rate. Properly noted that the Agent report was procedural rather than substantive. Appropriately distinguished factual data from methodology. Score: 4/4

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three plausible reference classes: (1) short-term movements during stable periods, (2) behavior during Fed policy pause periods, (3) post-rate-cut stabilization. Selected the most appropriate one (short-term stable period movements) with clear justification. However, did not quantify historical volatility from any reference class. Score: 3/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified the 7-day forecast window. Noted recent weekly range of 5bp and stability at 3.57% for 3 consecutive days. Acknowledged potential data releases as risk factors but did not enumerate them specifically. Score: 3/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchored on current 3.57% with a 10th-90th range of 23bp (3.47-3.70). Reasoning was qualitative rather than mathematical -- described "2.5x the recent 2-week range" as justification. The range is plausible but somewhat narrow for a 7-day Treasury yield forecast. Score: 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of 3.57% (median between P40=3.55 and P60=3.59) is well-anchored to the most recent data.
- Distribution is roughly symmetric with a slight upward skew (P90 is 13bp above median vs. P10 being 10bp below). This slight upside skew is reasonable given the ISM surprise context.
- Appropriately anchored on Feb 4 closing value of 3.57%.
- The 10th-90th range of 23bp is on the narrower side of reasonable for a 7-day Treasury yield forecast.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation of all four sources with quality ratings. Correctly identified the CNBC/Tradeweb distinction from the DGS2 constant maturity rate. Good assessment of the Agent report's limitations. Score: 4/4

- **Reference Class Selection:** Similar to S1-1 -- identified three reference classes (7-day forward movements, weekly volatility in stable periods, Fed policy hold periods). Selected the most appropriate one. Noted typical daily changes of 0-5bp and weekly ranges within 10bp, though these are qualitative rather than statistically derived. Score: 3/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 7-day window. Noted 3-day stability at 3.57%, no major Fed meeting in window. Mentioned typical weekly volatility of +/-10-20bp. Score: 3/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear reasoning: centered on 3.57%, 10th-90th of 3.42-3.72 (30bp range). Explicitly stated this represents "realistic weekly volatility" with acknowledgment of normal market uncertainty. Slightly wider than S1-1, which is also defensible. Score: 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of ~3.57% (midpoint of P40=3.55, P60=3.59) is well-calibrated.
- Distribution is symmetric around ~3.57% with 30bp 10th-90th range.
- Good anchoring on the Feb 4 data point with appropriate widening for weekly horizon.
- Mentioned that bounds (2.93-4.93) are extremely wide for a 7-day horizon -- shows good awareness of question scaling.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Good evaluation with clear fact/opinion distinction for each source. Correctly noted that the CNBC quote is "not DGS2" and only useful as a "corroborating level check." Identified the Agent report's illustrative (not confirmed) statistics. Score: 3/4 (slightly less granular than Sonnet outputs)

- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three reference classes and explicitly chose the most relevant one: "Weekly changes in 2-year yields in the current regime (rate-cut/hold uncertainty but not ZLB)." Good reasoning about why regime-dependent reference classes are superior to unconditional ones. Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 7 calendar days / 5 trading days. Provided useful context: "In calm weeks, 2-year moves single digits to ~15 bps. Around major macro releases, 20-35 bps weeks are plausible." Identified event risk from potential jobs report and CPI mid-month. Score: 3/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Centered on ~3.56% with a 10th-90th band of 45bp (3.33-3.78). Explicitly stated: "I'm setting a 10-90 band of ~45 bps width to incorporate unknown unknowns." The mathematical derivation is transparent. However, this range is quite wide relative to the stated stable market conditions. Score: 2/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of ~3.55% (midpoint of P40=3.50, P60=3.60) is reasonable but has a wider central range than other forecasters.
- The 10th-90th range of 45bp is substantially wider than the Sonnet outputs (23bp and 30bp). This creates a flatter, more uncertain distribution.
- The wide range may be justified by GPT-5.2's acknowledgment of potential macro release surprises, but it conflicts with the stated "status quo anchor" and "mean-reverting" characterization.
- Some internal tension: identifies the regime as stable and range-bound, yet produces the widest distribution among all outside views.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but effective evaluation. Correctly classified all sources' fact/opinion content. Notably referenced "1,600 observations" from historical 5-trading-day changes, showing quantitative grounding. Score: 3/4

- **Reference Class Selection:** Strongest reference class analysis in the ensemble. Explicitly chose "historical 5-trading-day percentage-point change in the 2-year CMT, 1990-2025" with claimed empirical statistics: mean ~0bp, SD ~10bp, 80% within +/-17bp, 90% within +/-24bp. Largest swing 58bp (March 2020). Also cited recent 60-day realized 5-day sigma of ~8bp. Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Precise: "Wednesday 5 Feb to Thursday 12 Feb, 5 market sessions." Identified specific macro calendar: jobless claims Feb 7, quarterly refunding reopening Feb 11. Correctly noted no FOMC meeting. Referenced forward OIS market pricing (1bp of easing) -- most sophisticated market analysis in the ensemble. Score: 4/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Mathematically rigorous: Normal with mu=3.55%, sigma=0.10%, with explicit percentile mapping (e.g., "10th = mu - 1.3sigma = 3.42"). Applied mild downward drift adjustment (-1bp) based on medium-term trend. Acknowledged fat-tail inflation of 10% relative to Gaussian. Score: 4/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of 3.55% (explicitly shifted from 3.56% by -1bp for downward drift). This is well-justified.
- Distribution is symmetric with 10th-90th range of 26bp (3.42-3.68). This aligns well with the stated empirical 90th percentile of +/-24bp.
- Anchoring on specific data points is excellent -- references not just the YCharts/CNBC data but also forward OIS pricing.
- The explicit normal distribution parameterization with fat-tail adjustment is the most rigorous approach in the ensemble.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and accurate. Correctly identified all sources as factual. Noted the absence of "opinionated commentary from identifiable experts." Score: 3/4

- **Reference Class Selection:** Strong quantitative approach: identified three classes (post-2010 weekly changes, 3-4% level-specific changes, pre-CPI week changes). Selected the level-dependent class (3-4%, ~700 observations) with explicit empirical summary: mean 0bp, sigma 8.2bp, 10th/90th at -18/+17bp, max 39bp. This is the most data-driven reference class in the ensemble. Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 7 calendar/5 trading days. Provided volatility scaling: "sqrt(5) x 8bp = 18bp." Identified January CPI due (though the date cited as Feb 10 may be incorrect -- the question notes CPI is due Feb 13) and weekly jobless claims. No FOMC or refunding in window. Score: 3/4

- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear statistical approach: mu=3.56%, sigma=0.10%, with tail stretching of 6bp for model risk. Explicit percentile mapping from normal distribution with adjustments. 10th-90th range of 36bp (3.38-3.74). Score: 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate of 3.56% (midpoint of P40=3.52, P60=3.60) is well-calibrated.
- Distribution has a 36bp 10th-90th range, wider than o3-F4 but narrower than GPT-5.2-F3.
- The tail stretching (6bp added to normal 10th/90th) is reasonable but less rigorously justified than F4's approach.
- Potential factual error: states "10 Feb 2026 -- January CPI (potentially market-moving)" which may be incorrect. This could have influenced the wider distribution.

- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Median [10th, 90th]) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 3.57 [3.47, 3.70] | 13/16 | Well-anchored central estimate, clear source quality distinctions | Qualitative rather than statistical volatility estimation |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 3.57 [3.42, 3.72] | 13/16 | Good awareness of question bounds, balanced distribution | No quantitative reference class statistics |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 3.55 [3.33, 3.78] | 12/16 | Best regime-awareness framing, good reference class reasoning | Distribution width (45bp) inconsistent with stated stable conditions |
| S1-4 | o3 | 3.55 [3.42, 3.68] | 15/16 | Most rigorous statistical approach, explicit Normal parameterization with fat-tail adjustment, forward OIS reference | Very minor: mild downward drift assumption may be overfit to recent trend |
| S1-5 | o3 | 3.56 [3.38, 3.74] | 13/16 | Strong quantitative reference class with level-dependent empirical stats | Possible CPI date error (cited Feb 10, may be Feb 13) |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Median [10th, 90th] |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model, Sonnet 4.5) | 3.57 [3.47, 3.70] |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 3.55 [3.42, 3.68] |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 3.57 [3.42, 3.72] |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 3.55 [3.33, 3.78] |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model, o3) | 3.56 [3.38, 3.74] |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured three-tier framework (Strong/Moderate/Weak). Strong evidence: current level stability at 3.56-3.57% across multiple sources, ISM Manufacturing surprise already priced in, auction schedule. Moderate: Warsh nomination, downtrend stabilization, Fed policy pause. Weak: J.P. Morgan surprise predictions, broad 2026 outlooks. Appropriately weighted for 7-day horizon. Score: 4/4

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 3.57 [3.47, 3.70] -> Output: 3.57 [3.48, 3.70], Delta = negligible (+1bp on 10th percentile). The minimal update is well-justified: three consecutive days of stability at 3.57%, ISM already digested, no major scheduled catalysts. Score: 3/4 (could have engaged more with the new information sources)

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addressed halving (3-4 days would narrow to 3.55-3.60%) and doubling (14 days would expand 10th-90th from ~25bp to ~40bp). Noted Feb 12 coincides with 30-year auction, creating potential volatility on resolution date. Score: 4/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all elements: (1) target variable correctly identified, (2) outside view base rate stated (3.55-3.58%), (3) consistency check (implied median 3.57%, mean ~3.58%), (4) key evidence enumerated with quality ratings, (5) blind spot identified (geopolitical crisis or banking stress). Score: 4/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate unchanged from outside view (3.57%), which is appropriate given no new contradictory evidence.
- The 10th-90th range tightened marginally from 23bp to 22bp. This is a very small adjustment, reflecting the assessment that current data reinforces stability.
- Tails are reasonable: 10th at 3.48% requires about a 9bp decline (plausible for risk-off), 90th at 3.70% requires 13bp rise (plausible for hawkish surprise).
- CDF should be smooth and monotonic given the near-Gaussian structure.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good three-tier structure. Strong: short timeframe limits movement, no major catalysts, recent stability. Moderate: downward drift pattern (-84bp over 5 months), ISM impact fading, Fed on hold, 10-year auction spillover. Weak: Warsh speculation, long-term cut expectations. Well-calibrated hierarchy. Score: 4/4

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input (S1-4): 3.55 [3.42, 3.68] -> Output: 3.55 [3.44, 3.66], Delta = +2bp on 10th, -2bp on 90th (tightening). Justified by: low volatility regime (realized 8bp vs historical 10bp), absence of catalysts, current data reinforcing status quo. The shift from o3's outside view is minor and well-reasoned. Score: 4/4

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halving (volatility scales by sqrt(0.5) = 0.71, tightening to +/-7bp 1-sigma) and doubling (scales by sqrt(2) = 1.41, widening to +/-14bp 1-sigma). Uses proper volatility scaling mathematics. Score: 4/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with all required elements. (1) Target paraphrased, (2) outside view base stated (3.55% median), (3) consistency check (implied median 3.55%, mean ~3.55%), (4) four key evidence pieces enumerated, (5) blind spot identified (geopolitical shock/SVB-like event). Score: 4/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate at 3.55% is the most conservative in the ensemble, which is appropriate given it received S1-4's already slightly bearish outside view.
- Explicit sigma adjustment from 0.10% to 0.085% through two steps (low volatility regime -10%, calendar void -5%). This is the most rigorous inside-view calibration in the ensemble.
- 10th-90th range of 22bp (3.44-3.66) is the tightest final distribution, reflecting strong confidence in status quo.
- Distribution is properly symmetric around the median.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structure. Strong: current level confirmed by multiple independent wires (3.56-3.57%), ISM manufacturing upside surprise. Moderate: Treasury refunding auctions Feb 10-12, BMO "range-bound" expectation. Weak: Fed chair speculation, long-horizon outlook pieces. Score: 3/4 (somewhat less granular than Sonnet outputs)

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input (S1-2): 3.57 [3.42, 3.72] -> Output: ~3.58 [3.36, 3.80], Delta = +1bp median, -6bp on 10th, +8bp on 90th (widening). The widening is justified by auction cycle and shutdown-related data uncertainty. The upward tilt from ISM surprise is reasonable. However, the magnitude of widening (from 30bp to 44bp range) is large given the evidence presented. Score: 2/4

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses halving ("tighten the interval, stick closer to 3.56-3.58") and doubling ("widen meaningfully, 25-40 bps"). Adequate but qualitative. Score: 3/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Abbreviated but present. Target identified, outside view base stated (~3.57), consistency check (median ~3.58-3.59, mean ~3.59), top evidence listed with 20-word limit, blind spot identified (risk-off shock or weak delayed labor data). Score: 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate shifted slightly upward to ~3.58% from outside view's ~3.55%. This is directionally consistent with the ISM surprise evidence.
- The 10th-90th range widened significantly from outside view (45bp to 44bp maintained but with different centering), reflecting the "fatter tails" adjustment for auction/data uncertainty.
- The 10th percentile at 3.36% (20bp below current) is quite aggressive for a 7-day horizon in a stable regime.
- Distribution shows noticeable upward skew: P60 is 3.62 (4bp above center) while P40 is 3.54 (4bp below), symmetric; but tails are asymmetric with P10 at 22bp below median and P90 at 22bp above.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured as Strong/Moderate/Weak. Strong: current 3.56% confirmed by two independent wires, historical volatility of 7-10bp weekly, 95% of weeks <25bp moves. Moderate: light macro calendar but delayed payrolls could move front end +/-10-15bp, auctions nudge yields a few bp. Weak: medium-term outlook pieces, Fed chair headlines already in price. Score: 3/4

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input (S1-3): 3.55 [3.33, 3.78] -> Output: 3.56 [3.30, 3.80], Delta = +1bp median, -3bp on 10th, +2bp on 90th (very slight widening). The o3 model essentially accepted the wide GPT-5.2 distribution and made only marginal adjustments. This represents under-engagement with the cross-pollinated input -- it should have recognized the GPT-5.2 distribution as wider than warranted and narrowed it. Score: 2/4

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Concise: "Halving would tighten sigma to ~6bp; doubling widens to ~25bp." Uses proper scaling language. Score: 3/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with all elements. Target identified, outside view base preserved with +2bp shift, consistency check (median 3.56%, mean ~3.57%), key evidence listed (4 items with 20-word constraint), blind spot identified (huge payroll miss/recession panic could drive below 3.30%). Score: 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate at 3.56% is reasonable and well-anchored.
- The 10th-90th range of 50bp (3.30-3.80) is the widest in the ensemble and arguably too wide for a 7-day forecast in a stable regime. A move to 3.30% would require a 26bp decline, which the forecaster's own analysis says occurs <5% of the time.
- The 10th percentile at 3.30% is particularly aggressive, representing a 2.6-sigma event under the stated 10bp weekly volatility regime.
- CDF monotonicity is maintained per the JSON output showing 201 points.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured chronologically and by strength. Strong: two independent sources confirming 3.56%, Fed schedule showing no meeting. Moderate: CPI on Feb 10 (potentially incorrect date) with historical +/-15bp influence, auction supply pressure. Weak: JPM surprise scenario, Schwab long-term steepening. Score: 3/4

- **Update from Base Rate:** Input (S1-5): 3.56 [3.38, 3.74] -> Output: 3.59 [3.35, 3.82], Delta = +3bp median, -3bp on 10th, +8bp on 90th (upward shift with slight widening). The upward shift is justified by ISM beat, supply pressure, and hawkish Warsh chatter (+3bp to mean). Tail inflation of 20% for unknowns is explicitly stated. Score: 3/4

- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief: "Halving tightens sigma to ~6bp; doubling widens to ~25bp and encompasses FOMC minutes and PPI." Score: 3/4

- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Target identified, outside view base stated (3.56%), consistency check (implied median 3.59%, mean ~3.59%), key evidence (5 items within word limits including option-implied 1-week sigma), blind spot identified (major geopolitical shock). Score: 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate at 3.59% is the highest in the ensemble, reflecting the strongest upward adjustment from current evidence (ISM, Warsh).
- The 10th-90th range of 47bp (3.35-3.82) is wide, second only to S2-4.
- The upward shift of +3bp from the outside view is directionally justified but the magnitude may be slightly aggressive for evidence that was already 1-2 days old by forecast time.
- References "CPI release Feb 10" which may be factually incorrect (CPI was likely due Feb 13), though this error did not substantially distort the distribution.

- **Score:** 12/16

| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 3.57 [3.42, 3.72] | 3.58 [3.36, 3.80] | +1bp | 11/16 | Partial -- direction correct but widening excessive |
| S2-4 | o3 | 3.55 [3.33, 3.78] | 3.56 [3.30, 3.80] | +1bp | 11/16 | Partial -- failed to narrow overly wide input distribution |
| S2-5 | o3 | 3.56 [3.38, 3.74] | 3.59 [3.35, 3.82] | +3bp | 12/16 | Partial -- upward shift justified but tails too wide |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):**

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4/o3):** This was the most effective cross-pollination in the ensemble. The Sonnet model received o3's statistically rigorous outside view (centered at 3.55% with 26bp range) and engaged meaningfully with it, applying its own low-volatility-regime assessment to tighten the distribution further to a 22bp range. The result was the most carefully calibrated final distribution in the ensemble. The cross-pollination added value by providing a different starting point (slightly lower median) that the Sonnet model then refined with its own judgment.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2/Sonnet 4.5):** Moderate engagement. GPT-5.2 received Sonnet's relatively tight outside view (30bp range) but widened it substantially to 44bp. While the reasoning cited auction and data uncertainty, this suggests the GPT-5.2 model had a prior toward wider distributions that dominated the cross-pollinated input rather than being genuinely informed by it.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3/GPT-5.2):** Weak engagement. The o3 model received GPT-5.2's wide 45bp distribution and essentially accepted it (widening marginally to 50bp). Given o3's demonstrated ability to produce rigorous statistical analysis in its own outside view (S1-4 and S1-5 both had tighter distributions), this represents a missed opportunity to correct the overly wide input. The cross-pollination may have actually degraded forecast quality by anchoring o3 on an excessively uncertain distribution.

**Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):**

- **S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-1/self):** Minimal adjustment, which is appropriate for self-model pollination. The Sonnet model confirmed its own outside view with only marginal tightening.

- **S2-5 (o3 receiving S1-5/self):** More substantial adjustment: shifted median up by +3bp and widened tails. This represents the o3 model using the inside view evidence (ISM, Warsh) to update its own base rate, which is the intended behavior.

**Overall cross-pollination effectiveness:** Mixed. The most effective pairing (S2-2) produced the best-calibrated final distribution. However, S2-4 failed to critically engage with its overly wide input, suggesting that the o3 model is more susceptible to anchoring on received distributions. Cross-pollination increased diversity in the final outputs -- the five forecasters' 10th-90th ranges span from 22bp to 50bp -- but this diversity may not be epistemically justified since the differences are driven more by model-level uncertainty preferences than by different interpretations of evidence.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All five instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: the FRED DGS2 daily value for Feb 12, 2026.
- All correctly identified the 7-day forecast timeframe (Feb 5 to Feb 12).
- All accurately assessed the current state: DGS2 at approximately 3.56-3.57% as of Feb 4, 2026, having declined roughly 50bp since October 2025.
- All correctly identified that the question units are "Percent" and formatted their predictions accordingly.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Current DGS2 level at approximately 3.56-3.57% as of Feb 3-4, 2026, with three consecutive days of stability near 3.57%.
2. The yield had declined approximately 50bp from early October 2025 (~4.06%) to the current level, with the decline appearing to stabilize.
3. No FOMC meeting scheduled between Feb 5 and Feb 12, 2026, with the next meeting likely in March.
4. ISM Manufacturing PMI came in at 52.6 vs. 48.4 expected, the first expansion in months, which was likely already priced into the Feb 4 close.
5. Treasury refunding auctions scheduled for Feb 10-12 (3-year, 10-year, and 30-year).

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-5 / S2-5 | CPI date | States "10 Feb 2026 -- January CPI (potentially market-moving)"; the actual January CPI was likely due Feb 13, not Feb 10 | Medium -- may have contributed to S2-5's wider distribution by creating a false catalyst within the forecast window |
| S1-4 | Minor date error | States "7 Feb: Weekly jobless claims" and "11 Feb: Quarterly refunding 10-yr reopening" -- plausible but not verified from research | Low -- these are reasonable calendar assumptions |
| S2-5 | Option-implied vol reference | References "Option-implied 1-week sigma ~10 bp, matching historical 18 bp (5-day)" -- the comparison of 10bp option-implied to 18bp historical is inconsistent | Low -- the two numbers measure different things (annualized vs. period) but the inconsistency is confusing |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations of invented events, dates, or sources were detected. The CPI date discrepancy is more likely a knowledge error than a fabrication. All market data cited (ISM at 52.6, yield levels, Treasury refunding amounts) is consistent across multiple sources in the research output. Several forecasters cited statistical properties (historical sigma, percentile ranges) that could not be verified from the provided research but are plausible and internally consistent.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong anchoring on current data:** All five forecasters correctly identified the current DGS2 level (~3.56-3.57%) and used it as their central estimate, which is the single best predictor for a 7-day-ahead Treasury yield forecast. None deviated more than 4bp from this anchor in their final median.
2. **Appropriate research pipeline for short-horizon financial forecasting:** The historical/current query split effectively separated base rate establishment from catalyst identification. Key near-term events (auctions, ISM, Warsh nomination) were surfaced and incorporated appropriately.
3. **S1-4 (o3) and S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5) produced exemplary statistical reasoning:** S1-4's explicit Normal parameterization with empirical calibration and S2-2's systematic sigma adjustment represent best practices in quantitative forecast distribution construction.

### Weaknesses
1. **Systematic model-level divergence in distribution width:** The Sonnet 4.5 models consistently produced 22bp 10th-90th ranges while the o3 and GPT-5.2 models produced 44-50bp ranges. This 2x difference in uncertainty is driven by model identity rather than evidence, creating an ensemble where the final distribution's tails are dominated by the wider-distribution models rather than reflecting a true consensus.
2. **Agentic search failure to retrieve actual data:** The agentic search for FRED DGS2 time series data returned procedural instructions rather than actual data values. This left the ensemble without direct access to historical volatility statistics, forcing forecasters to rely on model knowledge for sigma estimates. A successful data retrieval would have given all forecasters a common empirical grounding.
3. **Insufficient challenge of cross-pollinated inputs:** S2-4 accepted S1-3's wide distribution essentially unchanged, and S2-3 widened S1-2's distribution rather than questioning the expansion. Effective cross-pollination should involve critical engagement with the received distribution, not passive acceptance or directional amplification.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The forecast correctly identified the central tendency and produced a well-anchored final prediction. Research quality was good and evidence was appropriately weighted. The main deficiencies are the model-level divergence in uncertainty calibration and the missed opportunity in cross-pollination. The final aggregated distribution (10th: 3.32, 90th: 3.88) may have overly wide tails driven by the o3/GPT-5.2 models, but the median and interquartile range are well-calibrated for a 7-day Treasury yield forecast.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- **Add direct FRED API integration:** The agentic search should be able to call the FRED API directly to retrieve time series data. This would provide all forecasters with exact historical volatility statistics rather than relying on model knowledge or scattered web quotes.
- **Include economic calendar verification:** Add a query specifically targeting the official economic release calendar (e.g., BLS, BEA, Treasury) for the forecast window to prevent CPI date confusion.
- **Surface forward market pricing:** Queries targeting Fed Funds futures, 2-year Treasury futures, or OIS market data would provide a market-based anchor for the distribution center.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Add explicit instructions for cross-pollination engagement:** The inside view prompt should instruct forecasters to explicitly evaluate whether the received outside view distribution is too wide or too narrow, and to justify any decision to accept it unchanged.
- **Consider trimmed or winsorized aggregation:** The current equal-weighted average is heavily influenced by the widest distributions. A trimmed mean approach (dropping the widest and narrowest 10th/90th percentiles before averaging) could produce more robust tail estimates.
- **Standardize uncertainty frameworks:** Provide all forecasters with a common empirical anchor for volatility (e.g., "the historical 1-week standard deviation for DGS2 is approximately 8-10bp in stable regimes") to reduce model-level divergence in distribution width.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Strong performance on both source analysis and calibration. Could improve by providing more quantitative grounding for volatility estimates rather than qualitative reasoning. S2-2's systematic sigma adjustment was the gold standard in this ensemble.
- **GPT-5.2:** Good conceptual analysis but tendency toward wider distributions than evidence warrants. The stated reasoning often points toward stability but the output distribution contradicts this. Needs calibration feedback to align stated reasoning with distributional width.
- **o3:** Excellent quantitative reasoning in outside view (S1-4 was the best in the ensemble) but susceptible to anchoring on wide received distributions in the inside view (S2-4). The upward shift in S2-5 was well-justified. Consider providing explicit guidance to o3 about challenging received distributions.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (numeric) | Yes | The question range is 2.93-4.93 (200bp). The 10th percentile spread across forecasters is 18bp (3.30-3.48) and the 90th percentile spread is 16bp (3.66-3.82), totaling ~34bp of disagreement. 34bp / 200bp = 17%, close to threshold. The aggregated 10th-90th range of ~56bp is 28% of the total range, exceeding the 20% threshold. |
| Update direction errors | No | All forecasters moved in consistent directions (slightly upward or stable) in response to ISM surprise and Warsh hawkishness. No forecaster moved in a direction contradicting the evidence. |
| Factual errors present | Yes | CPI date cited as Feb 10 by S1-5/S2-5 may be incorrect (likely Feb 13). Minor impact on distribution. |
| Hallucinations detected | No | No invented events, sources, or data points detected. |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | S2-2 benefited significantly from receiving S1-4's rigorous input. S2-4 failed to critically engage with S1-3's overly wide distribution. Net effect is mixed. |
| Critical info missed in research | No | All decision-relevant near-term factors were surfaced. The missed precise CPI date is minor. Historical volatility statistics were imputed from model knowledge rather than computed from data. |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All base rate calculations are mathematically consistent with their stated parameters. |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | No | No single forecaster's median is more than 4bp from the ensemble mean (~3.57%). Distribution widths vary but no median is a statistical outlier. |
