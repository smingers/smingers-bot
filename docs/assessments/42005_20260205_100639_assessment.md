## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| AskNews returned zero relevant results and deep research failed | Med | Research | AskNews current-search results were entirely irrelevant (Charles Schwab stock, Nigerian fraud case, Bicycle Therapeutics CFO). Deep research also failed (403 usage limit). |
| AskNews deep research failed with 403 error | Low | Research | AskNews deep research hit usage limit (403). News search returned 22 articles but none about the correct Charles Victor Thompson. |
| S1-1 query generation hallucinated baseline volatility | Low | S1-1 | Query analysis stated "daily values usually oscillate between 3 and 9, with occasional spike to ~15" — this was fabricated. Pre-execution daily values were 0-1; only the execution spike produced values >3. |
| Ensemble convergence too tight to assess calibration diversity | Low | Aggregation | All 5 final predictions within a narrow 90-95% band for "Doesn't change." While this is likely correct, the tight spread means cross-pollination added little diversification value. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. `charles victor thompson execution date` (Google)
2. `charles victor thompson 2026 news` (Google News)
3. `Status of Charles Victor Thompson legal proceedings or media events Feb 2026` (Agent)
4. `charles victor thompson` (Google Trends)

**Current Queries:**
1. `charles victor thompson execution 2026` (Google)
2. `charles victor thompson latest news` (Google News)
3. `What new developments or scheduled court or execution dates concern Texas inmate Charles Victor Thompson between February 5 and February 12 2026?` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Background/past events, base rates | Recent news, forward-looking catalysts |
| Content type | Execution coverage, legal history, Google Trends data | Post-execution follow-up, near-term events |
| Unique contribution | Established the execution occurred Jan 28, decay pattern, 7-day base rates (90/7/2) | Confirmed zero new coverage after Jan 29, no scheduled events |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries established the factual foundation (execution occurred, case closed) and crucially included the Google Trends query for quantitative base rates. Current queries probed for any new developments that might disrupt the decay pattern.
- **Google Trends query was correctly triggered** by the LLM recognizing this is a Google Trends question. This is the first forecast to use the recently updated Google Trends tool with **directional base rates** (increase/decrease split) and **daily CSV values**.
- Historical queries effectively targeted base rate establishment through both the Google Trends tool and the agentic search for event context.
- The agentic search was notably well-focused: 2 steps, 5 queries, all targeting legal proceedings, media events, documentaries, and appeals — no redundancy with the Google Trends tool. This contrasts with 42001 where the agentic search spent steps researching Google Trends data. The difference likely comes from the query ("legal proceedings or media events") being more specific, though the agentic search context (title + description) still mentioned Google Trends prominently.
- AskNews results were entirely noise — all articles were about other people named Charles, Thompson, or Victor. The deep research call also failed with a 403 error.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The query generation analysis text in `query_historical.md` contains forecasting language ("the outside view favors 'Doesn't change'") which is mildly inappropriate for the research phase, but this is generated by the query-generation LLM, not a search result. The actual search outputs (article summaries, agent report, Google Trends data) are factual.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** (1) Thompson executed Jan 28, 2026 — case closed, no further legal proceedings. (2) Google Trends daily values showing spike to 100 on Jan 29, decay to 2 by Feb 5. (3) Directional base rates: 90% no change, 7% increase, 2% decrease in 7-day windows. (4) No upcoming media events, documentaries, or anniversaries in Feb 5-12 window.
- **Critical information missed:** Nothing critical was missed. The research comprehensively covered the execution context and absence of forward catalysts.
- **Source quality:** Excellent. Mainstream outlets (NBC, AP, USA Today, Houston Public Media), official TDCJ records, Death Penalty Information Center. Google Trends data is the actual resolution metric.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough. Evaluates each source by quality and date. Correctly identifies the Agent report as the most useful for situational awareness and Google Trends data as the strongest input. Notes opinions are limited to family/prosecutor quotes. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes: (1) executed death row inmates GT patterns, (2) one-time news events, (3) low-volume search terms. Selects #1 as most applicable. Good justification — execution is a terminal event with predictable decay. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 7-day window, identifies we're 8 days post-execution in the "noise floor" range (0-3). Maps the full decay curve day by day. Notes the value has essentially returned to baseline. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses the 90/7/2 split from the Google Trends tool. Correctly notes that the base rate includes the spike period and that baseline stability is likely higher than 90%. Clear reasoning. (3/4 — doesn't quantify the adjustment for baseline-only periods)
- **MC-specific:** Assigns probabilities to all 3 options summing to 100%. Correctly notes "Decreases" is mechanically near-impossible since dropping >3 from value 2 requires negative values.
- **Score:** 15/16

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Clear categorization and assessment. Correctly distinguishes fact from opinion. Notes the "critical finding" that the Google Trends data shows a massive spike followed by classic decay pattern. Notes "floor effect" concept. (3/4 — doesn't individually assess each source as thoroughly as S1-1)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes similar to S1-1. Selects executed death row inmates as most relevant. Good reasoning about the terminal nature of execution events. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 7-day window, 8 days post-execution. Includes the full day-by-day decay timeline with percentage drops. Notes values are in "noise floor" range. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from the 90/7/2 base rate. Adjusts slightly: Increase from 7→9% to account for low-volume jitter, Doesn't change from 90→87%, Decrease 2→4% for floor effects. The reasoning that low-volume terms have occasional +4 blips is sound. (4/4)
- **MC-specific:** All options addressed, probabilities sum to 100%.
- **Score:** 14/16

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Groups sources efficiently. Notes the GoogleTrendsData block is "most directly relevant." Distinguishes between news articles (high quality, stale for forward prediction) and the agent report (useful secondary synthesis). Correctly identifies floor/low-volume dynamics as an adjustment lens. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes and notably combines class 1 (all 7-day windows for this term) with class 3 (floor/low-volume dynamics) as an adjustment lens. This is analytically strong — using the empirical distribution but correcting for current state. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 7-day window. Notes the fixed-date URL reduces rescaling noise — an observation unique to this forecaster and technically relevant. Maps the full decay pattern. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchors on 90/7/2, then adjusts: slight downward for "Increase" (no upcoming event), downward for "Decrease" (floor effect), redistribute to "Doesn't change." Final: 92/7/1. Conservative, well-justified. (4/4)
- **MC-specific:** All options covered, sum to 100%. Notes "Increase" is the primary upset pathway.
- **Score:** 16/16

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Grouped efficiently by type. Notes the "critical finding" that the provided Google Trends data is "the strongest evidence." Identifies the floor effect at low values. Good quality assessment. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes, selects the 7-day windows for same term. Notes Classes 2 and 3 lack sufficient data points for stable empirical distribution — a mature observation. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 7-day window. Notes that once post-event values fall below 5, they almost always drift toward 0. Claims to have "checked on five other 2024-25 Texas executions as a spot test" — this may be hallucinated or from the model's training data, but the conclusion is sound. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from 90/7/3. Adjusts: Increase 7→5% (no catalyst, anecdotal evidence from other executions), Decrease 3→4% (rescaling risk symmetrical but kept as small tail). Final: 91/5/4. (4/4)
- **MC-specific:** All options summing to 100%. Clear reasoning for the "Decrease" floor constraint.
- **Score:** 14/16

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and accurate. Grouped by source type. Notes Google Trends is the primary quantitative source and highest credibility. Identifies agent report as useful for news calendar. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same 3 classes. Selects "all 7-day windows in current 90-day series" with explicit n≈22. Notes floor effect and structural decay. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 7-day window. Notes sensitivity: halving would increase "Doesn't change," doubling would decrease it by ~5-6 points. This sensitivity analysis is helpful. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from 90/7/3, widens tails slightly: +2 to Increases, +1 to Decreases, -3 from Doesn't change. Final: 87/9/4. The most "uncertain" of the five but reasoning is explicit. (3/4)
- **MC-specific:** All options addressed. Sums to 100%.
- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 5/93/2 | 15/16 | Comprehensive source analysis, clear floor-effect reasoning | Doesn't quantify baseline-only adjustment |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 9/87/4 | 14/16 | Good low-volume jitter consideration | Slightly wider tails than evidence warrants |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 7/92/1 | 16/16 | Combines reference classes as adjustment lens; notes URL rescaling reduction | None significant |
| S1-4 | o3 | 5/91/4 | 14/16 | Cross-referenced other execution cases; mature statistical reasoning | Possible hallucination of "spot-checked 5 other executions" |
| S1-5 | o3 | 9/87/4 | 13/16 | Explicit sensitivity analysis for timeframe changes | Most uncertain; widest tails |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 5/93/2 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 5/91/4 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 9/87/4 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 7/92/1 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 9/87/4 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied. Strong: zero new media coverage, execution finality, 90% base rate. Moderate: no scheduled catalysts, low baseline value. Weak: random fluctuation at low values. Well-structured. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 5/93/2 → Output: 4/91/5. Δ: Increases -1, Doesn't change -2, Decreases +3. The increase in "Decreases" from 2→5% is explained as accounting for measurement noise at low values. Direction is defensible though the magnitude of the Decreases shift seems slightly large given the floor constraint. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed: if halved, more stable; if doubled, slightly more fluctuation but still within ±3 threshold. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed fully. Blind spot identified (unexpected viral event). Probabilities sum to 100. (4/4)
- **MC-specific:** All three options updated with reasoning. Notes floor effect creates asymmetry.
- **Score:** 14/16

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong/Moderate/Weak applied. Key insight: "Zero new articles about Charles Victor Thompson in the AskNews feed" is correctly identified as "evidence of absence, not just absence of evidence." Name confusion in search results noted as indicator that interest has dissipated. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 5/91/4 → Output: 8/90/2. Δ: Increases +3, Doesn't change -1, Decreases -2. Increases went UP from outside view despite evidence strongly favoring stability. The reasoning is that low-volume Google Trends jitter can cause blips, and the 10 Feb Florida execution might briefly re-mention Thompson. This is reasonable but slightly counter-intuitive given the "zero new coverage" evidence. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed with halved/doubled analysis. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Identifies blind spot (viral content). Notes potential 10 Feb Florida execution as echo catalyst — a unique and valid observation among the five forecasters. (4/4)
- **MC-specific:** All options updated, sum to 100%.
- **Score:** 14/16

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Brief but effective. Notes the current trajectory is "near floor" and absence of scheduled events. Low-volume jitter acknowledged. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 9/87/4 → Output: 4/95/1. Δ: Increases -5, Doesn't change +8, Decreases -3. Large shift toward "Doesn't change," well-justified by confirming evidence. The S1-2 outside view had wider tails; S2-3 correctly tightened them based on the strong confirmatory current evidence. This is excellent cross-pollination — received a more uncertain prior and used evidence to make it more confident. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Included: shorter window → higher "Doesn't change," longer → modestly more risk. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present but abbreviated compared to others. Key elements covered. (3/4)
- **MC-specific:** All options updated. Floor effect correctly reduces "Decreases" to 1%.
- **Score:** 13/16

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured as Strong/Moderate/Weak. Notes the historical post-peak decay data, absence of news hooks, and low-volume jitter risk. Identifies "possible algorithmic rescaling" as a weak symmetric risk. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 7/92/1 → Output: 8/90/2. Δ: Increases +1, Doesn't change -2, Decreases +1. Very modest shift — essentially maintaining the GPT-5.2 outside view with minor adjustment for tail risks. Justification: catalysts absent → -2 from Increase, but floor effect → +1 to Decrease, net +1 back to Doesn't change. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Halving would raise "no change" a few points; doubling would shave 5-6 points. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed in abbreviated form. Blind spot identified (viral TikTok of jailbreak escape). Notes this could move "Increases" to ≥30% if it happened. (3/4)
- **MC-specific:** All options addressed, sum to 100%.
- **Score:** 12/16

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structure. Strong: 90% base rate, post-execution decay. Moderate: current value near floor, no scheduled events, possible Feb 10 echo. Weak: rescaling, viral clip risk. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 9/87/4 → Output: 5/91/4. Δ: Increases -4, Doesn't change +4, Decreases 0. Correctly tightened from the wider S1-5 outside view, pulling "Increases" down and pushing "Doesn't change" up based on lack of catalysts. Good use of cross-pollination signal. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Halving increases confidence; doubling decreases by ~5%. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. ±10% swing test performed. Blind spot: viral social media clip. (3/4)
- **MC-specific:** All options addressed, sum to 100%.
- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 5/93/2 | 4/91/5 | -1/-2/+3 | 14/16 | Partial — Decreases shift slightly large |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 5/91/4 | 8/90/2 | +3/-1/-2 | 14/16 | Partial — Increases rose despite "zero coverage" evidence |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 9/87/4 | 4/95/1 | -5/+8/-3 | 13/16 | Yes — correctly tightened wide prior |
| S2-4 | o3 | 7/92/1 | 8/90/2 | +1/-2/+1 | 12/16 | Yes — minimal but appropriate |
| S2-5 | o3 | 9/87/4 | 5/91/4 | -4/+4/0 | 13/16 | Yes — correctly tightened |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 ← o3 S1-4):** Engaged meaningfully with S1-4's outside view. S1-4 had 5/91/4; S2-2 shifted to 8/90/2, widening "Increases" and narrowing "Decreases." The shift is explained by the Feb 10 Florida execution echo and low-volume jitter. Genuine analytical contribution, though the increase in "Increases" is debatable.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← Sonnet 4.5 S1-2):** Excellent cross-pollination. Received the widest-tailed prior (9/87/4) and correctly tightened it to 4/95/1 based on strong confirmatory evidence. This is the cross-pollination mechanism working as designed — a different model challenges a prior and adjusts with evidence.

- **S2-4 (o3 ← GPT-5.2 S1-3):** Made only minimal adjustments from the GPT-5.2 prior (7/92/1 → 8/90/2). Essentially endorsed the S1-3 analysis. Low impact but not inappropriate.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 made small adjustments from its own prior. S2-5 made larger adjustments from a wider prior, showing the inside view evidence drove convergence. Both appropriate.

- **Overall:** Cross-pollination had limited diversification effect because all forecasters converged on the same strong signal (post-execution decay, no catalysts). The mechanism worked correctly but added little value in a case with overwhelming evidence pointing one direction. The ensemble's tight 90-95% range reflects genuine convergence, not lack of diversity.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood: resolution compares Feb 5 value to Feb 12 value using ±3 threshold on the fixed-date Google Trends URL.
- All correctly identified the 7-day forecast window.
- All correctly assessed the current value (~2) and post-execution decay context.

### Factual Consensus

1. Thompson was executed on January 28-29, 2026 (first US execution of 2026)
2. Google Trends value peaked at 100 on Jan 29, decayed to 2 by Feb 5
3. No further legal proceedings or scheduled media events in February
4. Base rate: 90% of 7-day windows show ≤3 point changes
5. Floor effect: current value ~2 makes large decreases mechanically near-impossible

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1 query gen | Hallucinated baseline range | Stated "daily values usually oscillate between 3 and 9" — actual pre-execution baseline was 0-1. The Google Trends daily values clearly show 0s across Jan 7-21 | Low — the forecaster corrected this in the actual analysis |
| S1-4 | Possible hallucination | Claimed to have "spot-checked five other 2024-25 Texas executions" — this data wasn't in the research context and may be from training data | Low — conclusion was sound regardless |
| S2-2 | Date discrepancy | Some sources say Jan 28, others Jan 29 for execution. Both noted by S2-2. Actually occurred evening of Jan 28 CT | Low — no impact on forecast |

### Hallucinations

The query generation LLM's claim about baseline oscillation "between 3 and 9" was contradicted by the actual Google Trends data showing 0-1 pre-execution. S1-4's "spot-checked five other executions" is potentially hallucinated. Neither impacted the final forecast.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **New Google Trends tool features worked excellently.** The directional base rates (7% increase, 2% decrease, 90% no change) were correctly computed using the new 7-day window matching (matching the question's Feb 5-12 timeframe). Daily CSV values showed the full decay trajectory. All 5 forecasters explicitly cited these base rates as their primary anchor.

2. **Strong convergence on the correct answer.** All 5 forecasters independently arrived at 87-95% for "Doesn't change," reflecting the overwhelming evidence: post-execution decay complete, value at baseline, no catalysts, floor effect limiting "Decreases."

3. **Floor effect correctly identified.** All forecasters recognized that with a current value of ~2, a decrease of >3 points (to <-1) is mechanically impossible. This was appropriately reflected in very low "Decreases" probabilities (1-4%).

4. **Agent report was high-quality.** The agentic search produced a comprehensive, well-sourced analysis confirming case closure, execution finality, and absence of February events — all in only 2 steps and $0.05.

5. **Cost-efficient.** $0.74 total, 144 seconds. The agentic search was especially efficient at $0.05 (2 steps vs. the 7-step maximum). The streamlined execution reflects clear, unambiguous research targets.

### Weaknesses

1. **AskNews yielded no useful results.** The 22 AskNews articles were entirely about other people named Charles, Thompson, or Victor. The deep research call failed with a 403 usage limit error. In this case, AskNews added noise rather than signal.

2. **Limited diversity in final outputs.** The 90-95% range for "Doesn't change" is extremely narrow. While this likely reflects the true state of the world, the ensemble added little value over a single forecaster for this question. The cross-pollination mechanism had no meaningful divergent priors to reconcile.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **A** | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |

**This Forecast Grade: A-**

Rationale: Research was comprehensive and the new Google Trends improvements (directional base rates, daily values, matched window) were used effectively. The agentic search was well-focused on legal/media events (2 steps, 5 queries, no redundancy with the Google Trends tool). All forecasters reasoned soundly with correct identification of floor effects and terminal event dynamics. Minor deductions for: (1) AskNews failure/noise, and (2) limited ensemble diversity. The final prediction of 91.4% "Doesn't change" is well-calibrated for a post-execution, near-baseline Google Trends question with no forward catalysts.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Agentic search was well-focused here — no action needed for this question.** The agentic search correctly avoided Google Trends data and focused on legal/media events (contrast with 42001 where it was redundant). The query generation LLM wrote a well-scoped agent query ("legal proceedings or media events"), and the agentic search stayed on topic despite seeing "Google Trends" in the question context. This inconsistency between 42001 and 42005 suggests the behavior depends on the query generation LLM's output rather than being systematic.

2. **Handle AskNews failures gracefully.** The 403 deep research error should be logged but not counted as a successful result. Consider retry logic or fallback to additional Google queries when AskNews fails.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Google Trends tool improvements are validated.** The directional base rates (increase/decrease split) and daily CSV values were both cited extensively by forecasters. The 7-day window matching (derived from the question's trend_start/trend_end metadata) correctly produced relevant base rates. These recent changes clearly improved forecast quality compared to the prior format seen in question 42001.

2. **Consider reducing ensemble size for high-consensus questions.** When initial research clearly points one direction (e.g., post-event decay with no catalysts), running 5 forecasters adds cost without commensurate diversity. An adaptive approach could detect consensus after 2-3 forecasters and skip the remaining calls.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** Produced the strongest S1 output (16/16). Combined reference class analysis was uniquely insightful. Fixed-date URL rescaling observation was technically relevant and not flagged by other models.
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Solid, thorough analysis. S2-2's identification of the Feb 10 Florida execution as a potential echo catalyst was a unique and valid observation.
- **o3 (Forecasters 4-5):** Sound reasoning. S1-4's cross-referencing of other execution cases added value. S2-4 was the weakest individual output — minimal engagement with the cross-pollinated prior.

### Impact of Recent Code Changes

This is the first forecast to use the updated Google Trends tool with:

1. **Directional base rates:** The tool now reports increase and decrease rates separately (7% increase, 2% decrease) instead of the previous combined "change" metric. All 5 forecasters cited the 90/7/2 split as their primary anchor, and the asymmetry between increase and decrease rates correctly informed the asymmetric tail probabilities in the final forecast.

2. **Dynamic window matching:** The tool extracted the 7-day window from the question's JSON metadata (`trend_start: 2026-02-05, trend_end: 2026-02-12`), producing base rates calculated over 7-day sliding windows instead of the previous hardcoded 12-day windows. This gave more relevant base rates for this specific question.

3. **Daily CSV values:** The raw 30-day daily values (showing the full 0→100→2 decay trajectory) were explicitly used by the Sonnet 4.5 models (S1-1 and S1-2), which mapped out day-by-day decay with exact values and percentage drops. The o3 and GPT-5.2 models referenced the data indirectly (e.g., noting pre-execution baseline was 0-1, which is only visible from the CSV) but didn't enumerate specific daily values. The summary stats (base rates, mean, std dev) were cited by all five.

**Assessment:** The Google Trends tool improvements clearly enhanced forecast quality. The directional split and daily values gave forecasters quantitative anchors they used extensively, and the window matching ensured the base rates were directly comparable to the question's resolution timeframe.
