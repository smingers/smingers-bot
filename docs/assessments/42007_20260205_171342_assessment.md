# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| 2 of 5 forecasters failed percentile extraction | Critical | S2-1, S2-2 | Forecasters 1 and 2 (both Sonnet 4.5) returned percentiles in a format the extractor could not parse (`**Percentile 10**: 3.58` with bold markdown). Only 3 of 5 CDFs were aggregated, reducing ensemble diversity. |
| Query generation hallucinated a rate cut | High | Research | The historical query analysis stated "the Fed lowered the target range by 25 bp to 3 1/4 % - 3 1/2 %" on 2026-01-28. In fact, the FOMC held rates unchanged at 3.50-3.75%. This factual error propagated into initial reasoning but was corrected by the FOMC press release surfaced during research. |
| Agent report returned methodology, not data | High | Research | The agentic search was asked to "Download FRED series AMERIBOR last 180 days and summarize daily mean, median, st-dev." It returned a step-by-step guide for how to download data and compute statistics, but provided no actual numbers. The requested 180-day mean, median, and standard deviation were left as placeholders ("x.xxx"). |
| AskNews returned mostly irrelevant results | Med | Research | 18 AskNews articles were returned, but none concerned AMERIBOR or US money markets. All articles were about foreign benchmarks (Euribor, BOE, RBI, Brazil DI). Deep research also failed with a 403 usage limit error. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. `AMERIBOR daily rate February 2026` (Google)
2. `AMERIBOR interest rate trend 2025` (Google News)
3. `Download FRED series AMERIBOR last 180 days and summarize daily mean, median, st-dev, and relationship to EFFR` (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. `AMERIBOR rate Fed policy 2026` (Google)
2. `AMERIBOR daily fixing February 2026` (Google News)
3. `Latest commentary on AMERIBOR overnight rate trends and expectations following Jan 2026 Fed meeting` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Recent data levels and 180-day statistical summary | Post-FOMC commentary and near-term expectations |
| Content type | FRED data, release calendars, AMERIBOR background | Policy context, analyst commentary, news articles |
| Unique contribution | Established current level (3.65%) and EFFR anchor (3.64%); found Term-30 AMERIBOR (~3.74%) | Confirmed FOMC held rates; no new catalysts identified |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are reasonably well-differentiated. Historical queries targeted the quantitative base (recent values, volatility, EFFR relationship), while current queries sought policy context and forward-looking commentary.
- **Critical problem with the query generation analysis:** The o3 model stated "the Fed lowered the target range by 25 bp to 3 1/4 % - 3 1/2 %" on 2026-01-28. The actual FOMC decision was to hold rates unchanged at 3.50-3.75%. This is a significant factual error in the analysis portion of `query_historical.md`. The error was corrected downstream when the FOMC press release was surfaced in the current search results, but it represents a problematic hallucination at the query generation stage.
- The Google queries were appropriately concise for keyword search but somewhat overlapping between historical and current (`AMERIBOR daily rate February 2026` vs `AMERIBOR daily fixing February 2026`).
- The agentic search query was well-conceived (requesting 180-day statistics and EFFR relationship) but the agent failed to execute it, returning only a methodology guide with placeholder values. This represents a missed opportunity for quantitative grounding.
- The Google News current query returned zero results, and AskNews returned entirely irrelevant foreign benchmark articles. The current research phase effectively contributed only the FOMC press release.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The query generation analysis in `query_historical.md` contains explicit forecasting language: "historical data suggest the rate on 2026-02-12 will stay within roughly 3.60%-3.75%, with the most probable outcome in the 3.66%-3.70% band" and "a distribution centred near 3.675% with a standard deviation of roughly 0.015%." This is inappropriate for the research phase, as it pre-anchors the forecasters on a specific distribution before they have seen the research results. However, this analysis text is generated by the query-generation LLM and not directly fed to the forecasters (the search results are). The actual search outputs (article summaries, agent report) remain factual.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** (1) Most recent AMERIBOR print: 3.65076% on Feb 4, 2026. (2) EFFR stable at 3.64% (Jan 28-Feb 3). (3) FOMC held rates at 3.50-3.75% on Jan 28. (4) Term-30 AMERIBOR at ~3.74% suggesting stable near-term expectations. (5) AMERIBOR typically trades a few basis points above EFFR.
- **Critical information missed:** (1) Actual 180-day AMERIBOR statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) were requested but not delivered by the agentic search. (2) No AMERIBOR-specific daily values beyond the two data points (Jan 29 and Feb 4) were obtained. (3) No information about upcoming Treasury settlements, reserve management operations, or other money-market technical factors that could affect the rate.
- **Source quality:** Mixed. The FRED data and Federal Reserve H.15 report are authoritative. The American Banker article and Investopedia LIBOR article provided background context but no forecasting value. The AskNews results were entirely noise (foreign benchmarks). The agent report was well-structured but lacked the requested quantitative deliverables.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Clear and organized evaluation of all six sources. Correctly identifies FRED data and H.15 report as highest quality. Correctly notes the American Banker and Investopedia articles lack predictive value. Accurately extracts key data points (AMERIBOR 3.65076%, EFFR 3.64%, Term-30 ~3.74%). (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three classes: (1) short-term AMERIBOR movements, (2) AMERIBOR-EFFR spread stability during stable policy, (3) AMERIBOR volatility during stable Fed periods. Selects class 1 anchored by class 3. Reasonable but lacks quantitative justification for the chosen reference class. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 7-day window (5 business days). Notes recent -2.26 bp decline from Jan 29 to Feb 4. Observes EFFR stability and no policy changes scheduled. Good but doesn't compute expected volatility over the horizon. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Centers at 3.65% with 80% CI spanning roughly 10-15 bp. States "historical upset rate for overnight rates during stable periods is low (<5%)." Reasonable but the lack of actual historical volatility data (since the agent failed to deliver it) weakens the quantitative grounding. (3/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** Distribution centered at 3.65% with P10=3.58, P90=3.72 (14 bp range). Slight right skew noted for credit-sensitive nature. Distribution shape is appropriate for a low-volatility instrument over a short horizon. All percentiles strictly increasing.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough categorization of all sources with quality ratings (High/Medium-high/Medium). Correctly identifies agent report as most relevant. Provides detailed assessment of each source's contribution. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same three classes as S1-1, selects "7-day forward predictions during stable monetary policy." Includes seasonal consideration (Q1 timing, mid-February calm). More nuanced than S1-1. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 5 business days. Notes recent -2.3 bp decline. Provides good observations about current tight spread to EFFR (~1bp). Notes mid-February as typically quiet. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** States "daily fluctuations of +-5-10 basis points are not uncommon even in stable periods." P10=3.55, P90=3.73 (18 bp range). Wider than S1-1, reflecting more uncertainty. Reasonable calibration. (3/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** Wider distribution than S1-1. Notes "distribution should be roughly symmetric around the median, with slightly fatter tails." P50 implied around 3.645. All percentiles strictly increasing.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent structured analysis. Distinguishes facts from opinions systematically for each source. Correctly identifies that only FRED data and EFFR level are "directly relevant for a 7-day ahead forecast." Notes the agent report's key data point (3.65076%) but appropriately flags it as "second-hand." (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three classes: (1) daily AMERIBOR changes over 6 months, (2) EFFR changes when no FOMC meeting is imminent, (3) same-horizon forecasts of other unsecured overnight rates. Clearly selects class 1 with class 2 as anchor. Provides quantitative context: "six-month history shows a mean around 3.66% and day-to-day moves that are typically +-1-3 basis points." (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 5 business days, no US holidays. States "the standard deviation of 5-business-day cumulative changes has been ~3 bp (0.03 percentage points) for the past half-year." This is the only forecaster to provide a concrete volatility estimate for the reference class. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Builds from the empirical 5-day sigma of ~3 bp, assuming normality with fattened tails. Sets P10-P90 at 3.55-3.79 (24 bp range), wider than the Sonnet 4.5 models. Centers at 3.66%. The wider upper tail (3.79) reflects sensitivity to funding-spread widening. Mathematically grounded. (4/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** Wide but well-justified distribution. Explicit sigma calculation (~3 bp for 5 days, inflated for tails). All percentiles strictly increasing. Distribution has slight right skew (center 3.66%, median between P40=3.64 and P60=3.68).

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and efficient. Groups sources by relevance, correctly dismissing LIBOR background and American Banker article. Correctly identifies the three most useful data points. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three classes, same structure. Selects "daily changes in AMERIBOR over the last six months" as closest. Notes "day-to-day moves that are typically +-1-3 basis points, with very rare 5-6 bp days." Provides good quantitative framing. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 5 business days. Provides explicit volatility estimate: "standard deviation of 5-business-day cumulative changes has been ~3 bp." States risk factors for >10 bp moves "occur only a few times per year." (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Models distribution as normal with mu=3.66%, sigma=0.02%. Sets P10-P90 at 3.61-3.71 (10 bp range). This is the tightest distribution of the five, which is well-justified by the stable policy environment but may underweight tail risks. (3/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** Very tight distribution. P10=3.61, P90=3.71 is only 10 bp wide. While defensible for a low-volatility rate, this may be over-confident for a 5-business-day horizon. All percentiles strictly increasing and symmetric.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Brief but accurate. Correctly identifies FRED data as highest reliability and agent report as consistent with FRED. Dismisses irrelevant sources efficiently. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Two primary classes: (1) same-series history over 6 months, (2) EFFR over same horizon. Selects class 1 with class 2 as cross-check. Notes AMERIBOR-EFFR spread averaged +1.5 bp. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** States "Since August 2025 AMERIBOR has traded between 3.60% and 3.71%, with day-to-day changes almost always <= 2 bp." Provides one-week realized sigma of ~2.5 bp. Notes fat-tail events at <1% frequency. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Centers at 3.65%. Uses sigma_daily=1 bp, time-aggregation sqrt(5)=2.2, inflated by 50% for tail risk -> sigma_adj=3.3 bp. This gives P10-P90 band of +-6 bp. Final: P10=3.59, P90=3.71 (12 bp range). Well-justified. (4/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** 12 bp range is tight but reasonable. Explicit statistical derivation is excellent. All percentiles strictly increasing. Slight right skew acknowledged via Term-30 at 3.75%.

- **Score:** 14/16

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (P50, P10-P90) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | ~3.65, 3.58-3.72 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~3.66, 3.61-3.71 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~3.645, 3.55-3.73 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ~3.66, 3.55-3.79 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | ~3.645, 3.59-3.71 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied. Strong: EFFR stability at 3.64%, recent AMERIBOR trend, no policy changes scheduled. Moderate: Term-30 AMERIBOR, historical spread. Weak: global rate trends, AFX acquisition. Well-structured and correctly prioritized. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~3.65 [3.58, 3.72] -> Output: ~3.64 [3.58, 3.71]. Delta: center shifted down ~1 bp. Justified by "recent convergence trend" toward EFFR. Correct direction based on the observed -2.26 bp decline from Jan 29 to Feb 4. Notes EFFR provides a "soft floor" preventing sustained trading below it. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed with halved/doubled analysis. If halved: tighter 5-8 bp CI. If doubled: wider 15-20 bp CI with month-end effects. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Target paraphrased, base rate stated, consistency check performed, blind spot identified (unexpected liquidity shock pushing rate up). (4/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** Central estimate shifted slightly lower. Distribution appropriately narrow. 80% CI at ~10 bp. Tails allow for unexpected events. CDF would be monotonic.
- **CRITICAL: Extraction failed.** Despite good reasoning, the output formatted percentiles as `**Percentile 10**: 3.58` with bold markdown, which the extractor could not parse. This forecaster's CDF was NOT included in the final aggregation.

- **Score:** 14/16 (reasoning quality), but **0 contribution** to final forecast due to extraction failure.

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied. Strong: Fed policy stability, AMERIBOR-EFFR spread stability. Moderate: recent AMERIBOR levels, no scheduled catalysts. Weak: global rate movements. Logical structure. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~3.66 [3.61, 3.71] -> Output: ~3.66 [3.62, 3.70]. Minimal change from the o3 outside view. Kept tight distribution, center unchanged. Justified by "strong anchoring from stable Fed policy." Appropriate given the confirming current evidence. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed with halved/doubled analysis. Provides specific sigma estimates for each scenario. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot identified (unexpected funding stress pushing rate to 3.75-3.80%). Includes alternative miss scenario (AMERIBOR dropping to 3.60-3.62%). (4/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** Very tight distribution. 80% CI at ~6 bp (3.64-3.68). This is the tightest of all forecasters and may be over-confident.
- **CRITICAL: Extraction also failed.** Same bold markdown formatting issue as S2-1 (`**Percentile 10: 3.62000**`). This forecaster's CDF was NOT included in the final aggregation.

- **Score:** 13/16 (reasoning quality), but **0 contribution** to final forecast due to extraction failure.

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structure using Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Strong: Fed unchanged, recent fixings stable. Moderate: AMERIBOR-EFFR spread variability. Weak: foreign benchmark news. Correctly identifies the "small adjustment only" conclusion. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~3.645 [3.55, 3.73] -> Output: ~3.645 [3.54, 3.75]. Slight widening of tails (P10 moved from 3.55 to 3.54, P90 from 3.73 to 3.75). Median roughly unchanged. Justified by acknowledging credit-sensitive upside tail risk and "mean-revert slightly wider" spread possibility. Appropriate direction. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed: shorter horizon would narrow 10-90 interval, longer would widen "meaningfully." (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present in abbreviated form. Target paraphrased, outside view stated, consistency checked, blind spot identified (US banking/funding stress). (3/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** Wide distribution (P10-P90 = 21 bp). Slight right skew acknowledged. CDF monotonic and smooth. Distribution appropriately captures both the stable central tendency and tail risks.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong: FOMC, FRED data, H.15 rates. Moderate: Term-30 and typical spread. Weak: background sources, foreign news. Efficient and correct. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~3.66 [3.55, 3.79] -> Output: ~3.65 [3.56, 3.78]. Center shifted down ~1 bp based on "mild downward drift observed (3.673% on 29 Jan -> 3.651% on 4 Feb)." Tails essentially unchanged. Notes "no scheduled FOMC, Treasury settlements, or quarter-end through 12 Feb reduces risk of large liquidity spikes." (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed with quantitative treatment: "If horizon were halved, variance falls ~sqrt(1/2) -> about 30% tighter. If doubled to two weeks, add month-end risk (Feb 28) so tails widen ~40%." This is the most rigorous timeframe sensitivity analysis among all forecasters. (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present. Target confirmed, base rate stated, consistency checked (median 3.66, mean ~3.66), blind spot identified (sudden counterparty risk scare pushing AMERIBOR >3.85%). (3/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** Moderately wide distribution (P10-P90 = 22 bp). Widened 90/10 band to +-0.11% around center, adding "fat-tail premium." Good quantitative approach.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear structure. Strong: actual AMERIBOR prints and standard deviation, Fed target range. Moderate: Term-30, typical spread. Weak: pre-holiday patterns, global moves. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~3.645 [3.59, 3.71] -> Output: ~3.6525 [3.62, 3.70]. Tightened slightly from outside view. Center shifted marginally up to 3.655%. Justified by noting mild downward drift and Treasury coupon settlements on Feb 14 / Presidents Day on Feb 17 "usually add 1/2 -1 bp." Net effect approximately zero. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed briefly: "sigma_one-week ~ 0.022%. I inflate 50% for tail risk => sigma_adj ~ 0.033%. If horizon were halved, sigma shrinks ~25%; doubled, widens ~40%." Quantitative and clear. (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present. Target confirmed, outside view mean stated, consistency check, key facts listed, blind spot identified (sudden bank-funding scare). (3/4)
- **Numeric-specific:** Tight distribution (P10-P90 = 8 bp). This is the tightest of the three valid forecasters and possibly over-confident. The 8 bp P10-P90 range is narrower than what even the own outside view suggested (12 bp), and the tightening was not well-justified by new information.

- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input (P10/P90) | Final (P10/P90) | Delta (P10/P90) | Score | Update Justified? | Extraction |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 <- o3 S1-4):** Received a very tight distribution (P10-P90 = 10bp) from o3 and essentially maintained it (P10-P90 = 8bp). Made minimal adjustments, effectively endorsing the o3 prior. The cross-pollination had low impact because the Sonnet 4.5 model was already reasoning in a similar direction. However, extraction failure means this output was lost entirely.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 <- Sonnet 4.5 S1-2):** Received a moderately wide prior (P10-P90 = 18bp) and slightly widened it further (P10-P90 = 21bp), mostly by extending the upper tail. This is reasonable -- the GPT-5.2 model incorporated its own assessment of credit-sensitive tail risk, producing a wider distribution than its Sonnet 4.5 input. Genuine analytical engagement with the cross-pollinated prior.

- **S2-4 (o3 <- GPT-5.2 S1-3):** Received the widest prior (P10-P90 = 24bp) and maintained it closely (P10-P90 = 22bp). Made minimal adjustments, essentially endorsing the GPT-5.2 analysis. This is appropriate given that S1-3 was the most rigorously derived outside view.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 made minimal adjustments to its own prior. S2-5 tightened its distribution from 12bp to 8bp range, which is questionable -- the inside view evidence (AskNews noise, no new AMERIBOR-specific data) did not warrant increased confidence.

- **Overall:** Cross-pollination had limited impact on this question. The stable rate environment meant all forecasters converged on similar distributions regardless of which outside view they received. The mechanism worked correctly but added little diversification value. The most notable cross-pollination effect was S2-3's slight widening of the Sonnet 4.5 prior, reflecting genuine disagreement about tail width.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: the FRED API value for AMERIBOR on 2026-02-12.
- All correctly identified the 7-day forecast window (5 business days).
- All correctly assessed the current AMERIBOR level (~3.65%) and its relationship to EFFR (3.64%).
- All correctly identified that no FOMC meeting was scheduled before Feb 12.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. AMERIBOR last print was 3.65076% on Feb 4, 2026 (prior: 3.67332% on Jan 29)
2. EFFR was stable at 3.64% throughout late January and early February
3. FOMC held rates at 3.50-3.75% on January 28, with next meeting in March
4. AMERIBOR typically trades 1-5 bp above EFFR during normal conditions
5. Mid-February is typically a quiet period for money markets (no quarter-end, no major holidays before Feb 12)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Query gen (o3) | Hallucinated rate cut | Stated "the Fed lowered the target range by 25 bp to 3 1/4 % - 3 1/2 %" on Jan 28. In reality, the FOMC held rates unchanged at 3.50-3.75%. The FOMC statement clearly says "maintain the target range." | High -- though corrected downstream by research, this error could have biased query selection and initial framing. It did not propagate to forecaster reasoning since all forecasters correctly cited the FOMC hold. |
| S2-1 | Fed target range discrepancy | States FOMC held at 3.50-3.75% in the inside view, which is correct. But the outside view references "current spread" without noting that the query gen analysis was wrong. | Low -- the forecaster's own analysis was correct. |
| S2-5 | Minor imprecision | States "Twenty-day mean 3.664%." This number appears to be derived from training data rather than from the research artifacts, which only provided two data points (3.67332% and 3.65076%). | Low -- the estimate is reasonable even if the sourcing is unclear. |

### Hallucinations

The most significant hallucination is the query generation model's claim that the Fed cut rates by 25 bp on January 28, 2026. The FOMC actually held rates unchanged, as confirmed by the Federal Reserve press release surfaced during research. This error was corrected in all forecaster outputs, which correctly cited the FOMC decision to hold rates steady.

S1-4 (o3) states "EFFR has been locked at 3.64% since July 2025" -- this is plausible given the research context but the specific "since July 2025" dating cannot be verified from the provided sources. The FOMC statement mentions the target range was 3.50-3.75% and the H.15 shows EFFR at 3.64%, but no source explicitly states when EFFR settled at this level.

S2-5 (o3) references "Twenty-day mean 3.664%" and "last seven prints 3.673 -> 3.651; day-to-day sigma ~ 0.008" -- these statistics are not directly available from the research artifacts (which only provided two AMERIBOR data points). They may come from the model's training data or be inferred, but cannot be verified from the provided sources.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Strong domain understanding across all forecasters.** Every model correctly identified the AMERIBOR-EFFR relationship as the primary forecasting anchor and appropriately reasoned about monetary policy stability, credit spreads, and calendar effects. The financial domain knowledge displayed was sophisticated and accurate.

2. **Good quantitative reasoning in o3 and GPT-5.2 outputs.** S1-3 (GPT-5.2), S1-4 (o3), and S1-5 (o3) provided explicit sigma calculations, time-aggregation formulas (sqrt(T) scaling), and tail-inflation adjustments. These models treated the numeric forecasting task as a proper statistical estimation problem rather than just narrative reasoning.

3. **Appropriate convergence on central tendency.** All five forecasters agreed on a median around 3.64-3.66%, which is well-grounded in the most recent AMERIBOR observation (3.65076%) and the stable EFFR anchor (3.64%). The disagreement was primarily about tail width, which is the correct dimension of uncertainty for this type of question.

### Weaknesses

1. **Two of five forecasters lost to extraction failure.** Both Sonnet 4.5 models (forecasters 1 and 2) formatted their percentiles with bold markdown (`**Percentile 10**: 3.58`) that the extraction pipeline could not parse. This reduced the ensemble from 5 to 3 valid CDFs, eliminating 40% of the ensemble and removing both instances of Sonnet 4.5 from the final aggregation. This is a systemic issue with the Sonnet 4.5 formatting behavior.

2. **Agent report failed to deliver requested data.** The agentic search was asked to download and summarize 180-day AMERIBOR statistics. Instead of executing the analysis, it returned a step-by-step methodology guide with placeholder values. This left all forecasters without the quantitative grounding (mean, standard deviation, spread statistics) that should have been the most valuable input for this numeric question.

3. **Query generation hallucinated a Fed rate cut.** The o3 query-generation model incorrectly stated the Fed cut rates by 25 bp. While this was corrected downstream, it represents a problematic error at the research framing stage. The query analysis also included explicit forecasts ("distribution centred near 3.675% with a standard deviation of roughly 0.015%"), which is inappropriate for the research phase.

4. **AskNews yielded zero relevant results.** All 18 articles were about foreign benchmark rates (Euribor, BOE, RBI, Brazil). Deep research also failed with a 403 error. For a niche US money-market question, AskNews had no useful coverage.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **C** | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |

**This Forecast Grade: C+**

Rationale: The core reasoning was sound across all forecasters -- they correctly identified the key drivers (EFFR anchor, stable policy, low volatility, short horizon) and produced reasonable distributions. However, the forecast quality is significantly degraded by: (1) loss of 2/5 forecasters to extraction failures, reducing ensemble diversity; (2) the agent report's failure to provide actual statistical data, leaving all forecasters working from only two AMERIBOR data points; (3) the query generation hallucination; and (4) complete AskNews failure. The final aggregated prediction (median 3.65%, P10 3.54, P90 3.78) is reasonable for the question but would likely have been better calibrated with all 5 forecasters contributing and with proper historical volatility data.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Fix Sonnet 4.5 percentile formatting.** The extraction failure for both Sonnet 4.5 instances is caused by the model outputting bold markdown formatting (`**Percentile 10**: 3.58`). The extraction regex should be updated to handle this pattern, or the prompt should include explicit formatting instructions (e.g., "Do NOT use bold/italic formatting around percentile labels").

2. **Improve agentic search for FRED data questions.** For questions about FRED time series, the agentic search should be directed to actually fetch data from the FRED API or scrape the FRED chart page, rather than writing instructions for how to do so. Consider adding a FRED API tool that can directly pull recent observations for a given series ID.

3. **Add fallback queries when AskNews returns irrelevant results.** For niche US financial instruments, AskNews consistently fails to find relevant coverage. The pipeline should detect when results are topically irrelevant (e.g., none mention the target series name) and fall back to additional Google/Google News queries.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Stricter formatting instructions for numeric percentiles.** The inside view prompt should include explicit format examples and prohibit markdown formatting within the percentile output block. Something like: "Output EXACTLY as shown, with NO bold, italic, or other formatting."

2. **Validate query generation analysis for factual accuracy.** The query generation step should not include explicit forecasts or should at minimum flag them as preliminary. The hallucinated rate cut (claiming 25 bp cut when the Fed held) suggests the query generation model is working from stale/incorrect training data about the January 2026 FOMC meeting.

3. **Consider direct data retrieval for FRED questions.** For questions in the `fred_value_at_time` format, the pipeline could add a dedicated step that fetches the last 30-90 days of observations directly from the FRED API, bypassing the general research pipeline. This would provide exact historical data rather than relying on article summaries.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Produced thorough, well-reasoned analyses with good evidence weighting and calibration checklists. However, the bold markdown formatting issue caused complete extraction failure. The model needs explicit formatting constraints in the prompt. Both outputs would have scored well (14/16, 13/16) if they had been successfully extracted.

- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** Produced the strongest outside view (16/16) with rigorous quantitative reasoning and explicit sigma calculations. The inside view was adequate but less distinguished. Overall the most analytically rigorous forecaster for this question type.

- **o3 (Forecasters 4-5):** Solid quantitative reasoning with explicit statistical frameworks. S2-4 provided the best timeframe sensitivity analysis with quantitative variance scaling. S2-5 was slightly over-confident in tightening its distribution without new justifying evidence.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (numeric) | No | Valid forecaster P50 values range from 3.645 to 3.66, only 1.5 bp apart. P10-P90 ranges span 8-22 bp. |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates were directionally appropriate (center near current level, small adjustments) |
| Factual errors present | Yes | Query generation hallucinated a 25 bp Fed rate cut. S2-5 cites statistics not verifiable from research. |
| Hallucinations detected | Yes | Fed rate cut hallucination in query generation; possible training-data-derived statistics in S1-4 and S2-5 |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Limited impact due to strong convergence on stable-rate scenario; S2-3 showed best engagement |
| Critical info missed in research | Yes | 180-day AMERIBOR statistics (mean, std dev) were requested but not delivered by agent; daily AMERIBOR values beyond 2 data points not obtained |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All base rates were reasonable given available data |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | No | All valid forecasters in close agreement; S2-5's tight 8bp range is the most notable deviation but still directionally consistent |
