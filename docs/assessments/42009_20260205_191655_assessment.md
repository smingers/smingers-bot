# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster 4 produced an outlier with "Decreases" as the most likely outcome (45%) | High | S2-4 | Forecaster 4 (o3) assigned 45% to "Decreases" and only 40% to "Doesn't change," making it the only forecaster to favor a non-"Doesn't change" outcome. This is a dramatic departure from the 92% base rate and from the other four forecasters (63-90% "Doesn't change"). The reasoning -- that post-spike tails "keep falling" in >50% of cases -- is asserted without supporting data and contradicts the provided base rate data. |
| Forecaster 3 outside view deviated sharply from base rate without adequate justification | Med | S1-3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) reduced "Doesn't change" from the 92% base rate to 52%, redistributing ~40pp to the tails. While the reasoning about base-rate distortion from zero-baseline periods is directionally sound, the magnitude of adjustment (92% to 52%) is extreme and poorly calibrated. |
| Query generation produced a forecast in its analysis output | Low | Research | The `query_historical.md` file includes explicit probability estimates ("Doesn't change: 60%, Increases: 20%, Decreases: 20%") which is inappropriate for the research/query generation phase. Research should inform, not forecast. |
| AskNews deep research failed with 403 error | Low | Research | AskNews deep research hit a usage limit (ForbiddenError: 403012). While the standard AskNews search succeeded (23 articles), the deep research capability was unavailable. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. `Steve Tisch upcoming event February 2026` (Google)
2. `Steve Tisch interview February 2026` (Google News)
3. `Are any significant NFL, entertainment, or philanthropic appearances scheduled for Steve Tisch between 5 and 13 February 2026?` (Agent)
4. `steve tisch` (Google Trends)

**Current Queries:**
1. `steve tisch upcoming events february 2026` (Google)
2. `steve tisch february 2026 news articles` (Google News)
3. `What significant events could make Steve Tisch trend between Feb 5 and 13 2026, including NFL or film industry news?` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Background context, scheduled events, base rates | Recent breaking news, forward-looking catalysts |
| Content type | Google Trends quantitative data, scheduled events, agentic search for appearances | News articles about Epstein files, NFL investigation, AskNews deep research |
| Unique contribution | Established 92% base rate for "Doesn't change" across 8-day windows, confirmed no scheduled appearances, full 30-day decay trajectory (100 to 5) | Surfaced massive Epstein scandal coverage (20+ articles from Jan 31-Feb 5), NFL investigation details, international media pickup |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are moderately well-differentiated. Historical queries focused on establishing context and scheduled events, while current queries targeted breaking news. However, there is overlap between the two -- both sets searched for "upcoming events" and both returned articles about the Epstein file release.
- The Google Trends query was correctly triggered and provided the most valuable quantitative input: the 92% base rate for "Doesn't change" over 8-day windows, plus the full daily value trajectory showing the Jan 31 spike and subsequent decay to 5 by Feb 5.
- The agentic search was well-focused (2 steps, 5 queries) and produced a high-quality negative finding: no scheduled appearances, press conferences, or events for Tisch during Feb 5-13. This was crucial context.
- AskNews succeeded in returning 23 articles (mostly about the Epstein/Tisch story from multiple international outlets), though the deep research call failed with a 403 error. The standard AskNews results were highly relevant and added international coverage perspective.
- A notable gap: neither query set explicitly targeted "secondary news cycle" patterns or prior Epstein file releases to establish how long scandal-driven Google Trends spikes typically last. This would have been valuable for calibrating the decay rate.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The `query_historical.md` output inappropriately includes explicit probability estimates: "Doesn't change (within +/-3): 60%, Increases (> +3): 20%, Decreases (< -3): 20%." This is a forecast, not a research output. Research should surface facts and base rates; forecasting should happen in the outside/inside view stages. Additionally, the analysis text in `query_historical.md` claims "Median daily value ~ 14" and "Middle 80% of days fall within a 10-point band" -- both of which are incorrect based on the actual Google Trends data that shows a median near 0 and values of 0 for most of January.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** (1) Google Trends daily values showing spike from 0 to 100 on Jan 31, decay to 5 by Feb 5. (2) 92% base rate for no change over 8-day windows. (3) Comprehensive Epstein scandal coverage from 20+ major outlets. (4) Crucial negative finding: no scheduled Tisch appearances Feb 5-13. (5) NFL investigation announced but no timetable. (6) Congressional Democrats claim only "half" of files released.
- **Critical information missed:** No systematic analysis of how Google Trends values behave specifically when starting from a value of ~5 (as opposed to the typical 0-2 baseline). The base rate of 92% is heavily weighted by periods when the value was at 0 and literally could not decrease >3 points.
- **Source quality:** Excellent. Major outlets (Guardian, BBC, CNN, CNBC, AP, ESPN, NBC), Google Trends quantitative data, well-sourced agentic search report. AskNews provided corroborating international coverage.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough and well-structured. Evaluates each source individually with quality, date, and relevance assessments. Correctly identifies the Google Trends data as the strongest quantitative input and the agent report as the most important negative finding. Distinguishes fact from opinion throughout. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 reference classes: (1) celebrity scandal news cycles, (2) NFL owner controversies, (3) Epstein-related search patterns, (4) generic 8-day windows for "steve tisch." Selects #4 as the formal anchor but notes necessary adjustments for the elevated baseline. Good reasoning about why the base rate needs context-dependent correction. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 8-day window. Maps the full decay curve (100 to 24 to 19 to 19 to 5 to 5) with specific dates. Notes the stabilization at 5 for Feb 4-5 as possible equilibrium. Includes weekend effect analysis (Feb 8-9). (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from 92% "Doesn't change" base rate. Adjusts to Increases 8%, Doesn't change 74%, Decreases 18%. The adjustment downward from 92% is justified by the elevated starting value (5 vs. typical 0-2), but the magnitude of the shift (92% to 74%) could be better justified. The reasoning about the +/-3 threshold creating a 2-8 range for "Doesn't change" is sound and important. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All three options assigned probabilities summing to 100%. Good analysis of what value ranges map to each resolution outcome (e.g., "Decreases" requires dropping to 0-1, "Increases" requires rising to 9+). Correctly identifies the asymmetry created by starting at 5 -- closer to the "Decreases" boundary than the "Increases" boundary.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Clear and systematic. Each source evaluated by quality and content. Notably identifies the agent report's negative finding as "highly relevant negative information." Good quality assessment. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes: (1) scandal-related Google Trends searches after peak, (2) celebrity/executive scandal news cycles, (3) NFL owner controversies during off-season. Selects #1 with good justification about post-spike decay patterns. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 8-day window. Maps the full decay timeline. Notes that the historical 8% increase rate and 0% decrease rate need context adjustment because the base rate is dominated by low-activity periods. This is an important and valid observation. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses empirical 92/8/0 as anchor. Notes the 0% decrease rate is "not credible conditional on starting at ~5." Allocates: Increases 5%, Doesn't change 73%, Decreases 22%. The reasoning is explicit and the concern about the base rate's zero-bias is analytically sound. However, 22% for "Decreases" may be too high given that the value only needs to drop to 1 or 0. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options assigned, sum to 100%. Good analysis of the mechanical requirements for each outcome. Considers correlations between options through the lens of the threshold mechanics.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Detailed and well-structured with numbered sources. Includes quality assessments and important caveats (e.g., "method transparency is limited" for the agent report). Notes the Google Trends data is "the most directly relevant empirical input." (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes and makes the sophisticated observation that Class 1 (all 8-day windows) has inflated "Doesn't change" rates because most windows start near 0, where decreases of >3 are structurally impossible. Proposes using Class 1 as the anchor but adjusting with Classes 2 and 3. This is analytically strong. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 8-day window. Maps the spike-and-decay pattern. Good observation about the "cooling-off regime" where decreases are more likely than in randomly chosen windows. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Reduces "Doesn't change" from 92% to 52%, which is an extreme adjustment. The direction is correct (the base rate overstates stability when starting from an elevated level), but cutting it nearly in half is poorly calibrated. Assigns Increases 18%, Doesn't change 52%, Decreases 30%. The 30% for "Decreases" is very high -- it requires the value to drop from 5 to 0-1, and the stabilization pattern at 5 suggests the decay rate has slowed significantly. (2/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options assigned summing to 100%. But the distribution is much flatter than the evidence warrants, making this more of a hedged bet than a well-calibrated forecast.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and efficient. Groups sources by type. Correctly identifies that no article projects specific dated events in the Feb 5-13 window. Notes opinions are limited and don't change the factual timeline. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes. Selects Class 1 (all 8-day windows for this term) with clear reasoning about sample size. Notes Classes 2 and 3 lack sufficient data. Applies a Dirichlet(1,1,1) smoothing prior to the empirical frequencies -- this is a sophisticated statistical technique correctly applied. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 8-day window. Notes the level on Feb 5 (value 5) is "already back near the 90-day median after the Jan 31 peak," indicating the most volatile phase has passed. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from empirical 92/8/0, applies Dirichlet smoothing to get 8.7/90.3/1.0, then widens tails slightly to 10/88/2. This is methodologically sound and well-justified. The final distribution is reasonable. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options assigned summing to 100%. Clear reasoning for each tail probability. Good use of formal statistical technique (Dirichlet prior).

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and accurate. Groups by source type. Correctly identifies Google Trends data as highest quality and most relevant. Notes news articles have high credibility but "limited predictive value for search behaviour after 5 Feb." (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes. Selects Class 1 (all 8-day windows for this term) as the main baseline. Explains why Classes 2 and 3 are less suitable. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 8-day window. Notes that Google's integer rounding at low values makes downward moves rarer than upward moves, explaining the 0% empirical "Decrease" rate. This is a technically valid observation about the measurement mechanics. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchors on 92/8/0. Applies a "Lindy correction" to avoid zero in "Decreases," adjusts downward on "Increases" for second-spike rarity. Final: 7/86/7. The symmetrical 7/7 split between Increases and Decreases is questionable -- the evidence for potential increases (NFL investigation, possible new file releases) seems stronger than the evidence for decreases (natural decay from 5 to 0-1), so a symmetric split loses information. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options assigned summing to 100%. Clear mechanical analysis of what each outcome requires.

- **Score:** 13/16

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | Inc 8% / NC 74% / Dec 18% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | Inc 10% / NC 88% / Dec 2% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | Inc 5% / NC 73% / Dec 22% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | Inc 18% / NC 52% / Dec 30% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | Inc 7% / NC 86% / Dec 7% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied. Strong: no scheduled catalysts (agent report), story age (5 days), stabilization pattern, 92% historical base rate. Moderate: Super Bowl distraction, story completeness. Weak: NFL investigation (ongoing but slow), congressional pressure for more file releases. Well-structured and comprehensive. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Inc 8% / NC 74% / Dec 18% --> Output: Inc 5% / NC 83% / Dec 12%. Delta: Inc -3, NC +9, Dec -6. The update direction is justified -- the inside view evidence (no catalysts, stabilization, generous +/-3 threshold) supports higher confidence in "Doesn't change." The shift is moderate and well-explained. The detailed mechanical analysis ("dropping to 2 = still Doesn't change, dropping to 1 = Decreases") is excellent. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed with halved (4 days: 85% NC) and doubled (16 days: 60% NC) scenarios. Reasoning is sound -- shorter windows favor stability, longer windows allow more opportunity for decay or new developments. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed thoroughly. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated. Consistency check performed. Key evidence listed with strength tags. Blind spots identified (unexpected NFL leak, second DOJ release, unexpected Tisch statement). Probabilities sum to 100. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options updated with clear reasoning. Good identification of the +/-3 threshold mechanics creating a 2-8 acceptable range. Correctly identifies asymmetry -- closer to "Decreases" threshold than "Increases" threshold. Relative probabilities between options adjusted sensibly (reduced both tails, increased center).

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong framework applied. Strong: 92% base rate, 95% decay already complete, no catalysts. Moderate: Super Bowl timing, story completeness. Weak: NFL investigation potential, political amplification. Good identification that "evidence of absence" (no new articles about Tisch in the current news feed) is meaningful. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Inc 10% / NC 88% / Dec 2% --> Output: Inc 8% / NC 90% / Dec 2%. Delta: Inc -2, NC +2, Dec 0. Very conservative update. The shift is minimal but directionally appropriate -- inside view evidence reinforces the stability predicted by the outside view. However, maintaining "Decreases" at only 2% may understate the risk of further decay from 5 to 0-1. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed with halved and doubled scenarios. Good reasoning. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed fully. All elements present. Blind spots identified (unexpected news leak, viral social media). Measurement noise at low values acknowledged. Odds check performed (90% = 9:1). (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options updated, sum to 100%. The very low "Decreases" probability (2%) stands out as potentially under-calibrated given the distance from baseline, but the reasoning about the "floor effect" preventing confident prediction of collapse is stated. Relative probabilities are internally consistent with the stated reasoning.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Reasonably structured. Strong: big initial revelation already passed, follow-on phase established. Moderate: more Epstein files expected, Super Bowl media ecosystem. Weak: Masters of the Universe producer credit. Evidence is correctly identified and weighted. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Inc 5% / NC 73% / Dec 22% --> Output: Inc 10% / NC 63% / Dec 27%. Delta: Inc +5, NC -10, Dec +5. The update went in a concerning direction -- it increased both tail probabilities and decreased "Doesn't change" from an already-low 73% to 63%. The justification for increasing "Increases" (more files expected, possible new mini-cycle) is marginally sound but weak. The increase in "Decreases" from 22% to 27% is harder to justify when the stabilization evidence from current news should, if anything, reduce confidence in continued decay. (2/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but adequate. Notes halved window would shift toward "Doesn't change," doubled window would increase both tails. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present and complete. Key evidence listed. Blind spot identified (fresh DOJ tranche or NFL/Giants action). (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options updated, sum to 100%. But the update direction for "Doesn't change" (downward) is questionable given that the current evidence (stabilization, no catalysts) should reinforce stability, not undermine it. The relative shift between options is not well justified by the evidence presented.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Brief but uses Strong/Moderate/Weak tags. Strong: historical post-spike decay pattern. Moderate: NFL only said "look into" (no timetable), Super Bowl week repetition. Weak: Masters of the Universe press releases. The assertion that "terms that have just spiked fall another 3-5 points within a week in >50% of cases" is stated as Strong evidence but is not supported by data in the research context. (2/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Inc 18% / NC 52% / Dec 30% --> Output: Inc 15% / NC 40% / Dec 45%. Delta: Inc -3, NC -12, Dec +15. This is a problematic update. The forecaster shifted 12 more percentage points from "Doesn't change" to "Decreases," making "Decreases" the most likely outcome at 45%. This contradicts the stabilization evidence (value held at 5 for Feb 4-5) and the generous +/-3 threshold (which means the value can drop to 2 and still resolve "Doesn't change"). The reasoning states it "shifts 12 pts from 'Doesn't change' toward 'Decreases' (continuous decay)" but this is based on an empirical claim about post-spike behavior that isn't in the provided data. (1/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Very brief. States halving would raise "Doesn't change" 5 points and doubling would raise "Decreases" ~7 points. Adequate but minimal. (2/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Abbreviated but present. Blind spot identified (surprise NFL disciplinary action or leaked video). Notes this would push "Increases" to >50% if it happened. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options sum to 100%. However, the most likely outcome being "Decreases" at 45% is deeply inconsistent with the evidence base. For "Decreases" to resolve, the value must drop from 5 to 1 or 0 -- meaning near-complete disappearance of search interest. This is a strong claim that requires strong evidence, and the forecaster doesn't provide it beyond asserting that "post-spike tails fall another 3-5 points." The relative probabilities are not well justified.

- **Score:** 8/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structure with strength tags. Strong: 90% base rate, post-spike decay. Moderate: current value near floor, no scheduled events, possible Feb 9 Super Bowl echo. Weak: rescaling, viral clip risk. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Inc 7% / NC 86% / Dec 7% --> Output: Inc 10% / NC 75% / Dec 15%. Delta: Inc +3, NC -11, Dec +8. The update shifts probability from "Doesn't change" to both tails, with a larger shift to "Decreases." The direction is reasonable -- the inside view adds context about post-spike decay momentum and the possibility of Goodell being pressed again at Super Bowl events. The magnitude is moderate. The explicit listing of adjustment components (+8pp "Decrease" from down-drift momentum, +4pp "Increase" from Super Bowl, +2pp "Increase" from surprise factor, -1pp "Increase" from lack of trigger) shows good analytical rigor. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Shorter window increases "Doesn't change," longer window decreases it. Brief but adequate. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot identified (NFL suspends Tisch). Consistency check present. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options sum to 100%. The distribution [10/75/15] is reasonable, though the 15% "Decreases" feels slightly high given the +/-3 threshold buffer. Relative probabilities between options are internally consistent with stated reasoning.

- **Score:** 12/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 8/74/18 | 5/83/12 | -3/+9/-6 | 15/16 | Yes -- evidence supports increased stability |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 10/88/2 | 8/90/2 | -2/+2/0 | 14/16 | Yes -- conservative but appropriate |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 5/73/22 | 10/63/27 | +5/-10/+5 | 11/16 | No -- update away from stability contradicts stabilization evidence |
| S2-4 | o3 | 18/52/30 | 15/40/45 | -3/-12/+15 | 8/16 | No -- "Decreases" as most likely contradicts +/-3 threshold and stabilization |
| S2-5 | o3 | 7/86/7 | 10/75/15 | +3/-11/+8 | 12/16 | Partial -- direction reasonable but magnitude of "Decreases" shift is high |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 <-- o3 S1-4):** Received the most conservative outside view (10/88/2) from S1-4 (o3). Engaged meaningfully -- made only minor adjustments, which is appropriate given that S1-4's high-stability prediction was well-supported by evidence. The final [8/90/2] essentially endorses the o3 prior with a small shift. Good cross-model engagement without overcorrection.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 <-- Sonnet 4.5 S1-2):** Received a Sonnet 4.5 prior of [5/73/22]. Rather than tightening the relatively wide tails based on confirmatory inside-view evidence, S2-3 actually widened the tails further (from 73% to 63% "Doesn't change"). This is poor cross-pollination behavior -- the inside view evidence (stabilization, no catalysts, Super Bowl distraction) should have increased confidence in stability, not decreased it. The GPT-5.2 model appears to have anchored too heavily on the "more files expected" narrative.

- **S2-4 (o3 <-- GPT-5.2 S1-3):** Received the widest prior (18/52/30) from S1-3. Rather than correcting this extreme distribution using inside-view evidence, S2-4 made it even more extreme by pushing "Decreases" from 30% to 45%. This is a failure of cross-pollination -- the o3 model should have recognized that S1-3's 52% "Doesn't change" was an outlier and used the current evidence to pull it back toward the base rate. Instead, it amplified the outlier.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5) made a well-justified update from its own prior, increasing "Doesn't change" by 9pp. S2-5 (o3) moved away from its own prior's stability, decreasing "Doesn't change" from 86% to 75%. The o3 models consistently favored higher "Decreases" probabilities compared to the Sonnet 4.5 models.

- **Overall:** Cross-pollination produced mixed results. S2-2 handled the cross-model input well. But S2-4 amplified an outlier prior rather than correcting it, which is the opposite of what cross-pollination should achieve. The final ensemble suffered because the S1-3/S2-4 pathway accumulated errors in the direction of over-weighting "Decreases."

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: compare Feb 5 Google Trends value to Feb 13 value, with +/-3 threshold determining "Doesn't change" vs. "Increases"/"Decreases."
- All correctly identified the 8-day forecast window (Feb 5 to Feb 13).
- All correctly assessed the current value at approximately 5 (based on Feb 4-5 stabilization).
- Multiple forecasters correctly identified the mechanical implications of the +/-3 threshold: from a starting value of 5, "Doesn't change" covers 2-8, "Increases" requires 9+, and "Decreases" requires 0-1.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. DOJ released 3+ million pages of Epstein files on January 30-31, 2026, with Tisch mentioned 400+ times
2. Google Trends peaked at 100 on Jan 31, decayed to 5 by Feb 5
3. NFL Commissioner Goodell announced investigation at Super Bowl week press conference on Feb 2-3
4. No scheduled Tisch appearances, hearings, or events during Feb 5-13
5. 92% of 8-day windows historically show changes of 3 points or less for "steve tisch"
6. Congressional Democrats claim only ~half of files have been released

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Query gen | Hallucinated baseline statistics | Stated "Median daily value ~ 14" and "Middle 80% of days fall within a 10-point band" -- actual pre-spike median was 0, and the 90-day mean was 2.2 | Low -- forecasters used the actual Google Trends data, not these incorrect query-gen figures |
| S1-1 | Minor date ambiguity | States "value dropped 14 points (19 to 5) in the most recent 2-day period" -- the daily values show 19/19/5/5 spanning Feb 2-5, which is a 3-day drop, not 2-day | Low -- does not affect the forecast |
| S2-4 | Unsupported empirical claim | States "terms that have just spiked fall another 3-5 points within a week in >50% of cases (multiple term studies)" -- no such studies were provided in the research context | Med -- this unsupported claim is the primary justification for the 45% "Decreases" probability |
| S2-2 | Underestimation of "Decreases" risk | Assigns only 2% to "Decreases" despite starting from 5 with baseline at 0-2, meaning a natural return to baseline would trigger "Decreases" | Low -- conservative but defensible |

### Hallucinations

The query generation LLM's claim about "Median daily value ~ 14" is clearly fabricated -- the actual 90-day mean is 2.2 and the median is effectively 0 (most days show values of 0-1 before the Jan 30 spike). Forecaster 4's inside view claim about "multiple term studies" showing >50% of post-spike terms falling 3-5 points within a week is unsupported by any research in the context and appears to be either hallucinated or drawn from training data without attribution.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Research was comprehensive and highly relevant.** The combination of Google Trends quantitative data, major news coverage from 20+ outlets, and a well-focused agentic search that confirmed no scheduled events produced an excellent information base. The Google Trends tool correctly provided the 92% base rate, daily values showing the full decay trajectory, and 8-day window matching.

2. **Forecasters 1 and 2 (Sonnet 4.5) produced sound, well-calibrated analyses.** Both correctly identified the key factors (no catalysts, stabilization pattern, generous +/-3 threshold) and produced reasonable distributions. S2-1's detailed mechanical analysis of the threshold boundaries (what values trigger each resolution outcome) was particularly valuable.

3. **Cross-pollination worked well for S2-2.** The Sonnet 4.5 model that received o3's conservative prior (10/88/2) handled it appropriately, making minimal adjustments that reflected a genuine engagement with the evidence rather than reflexive conformity or contrarianism.

4. **All forecasters correctly identified the absence of catalysts as the decisive factor.** The agent report's finding of zero scheduled appearances was consistently cited as Strong evidence across all forecasters. The Super Bowl timing (Feb 9) was recognized as a potential but limited factor.

### Weaknesses

1. **Forecaster 4 produced a severe outlier that distorted the ensemble.** The [15/40/45] distribution with "Decreases" as the most likely outcome is poorly supported. The value needs to drop from 5 to 0-1 for "Decreases" to resolve, and the stabilization pattern at 5 over Feb 4-5 directly contradicts the assertion of continued rapid decay. This single outlier pulled the ensemble's "Doesn't change" from what would have been ~78% (without Forecaster 4) down to 70.2%, and inflated "Decreases" from ~14% to 20.2%.

2. **The GPT-5.2 model (Forecaster 3) consistently underweighted stability.** Both S1-3 (52% "Doesn't change") and S2-3 (63% "Doesn't change") assigned too much probability to the tails. The reasoning about base-rate distortion from zero-baseline periods was directionally correct but poorly calibrated in magnitude.

3. **Wide ensemble spread reduces confidence.** The "Doesn't change" range of 40-90% across the five forecasters indicates fundamental disagreement about the question dynamics. This is not healthy diversity -- it reflects different mental models that cannot all be correct. The Sonnet 4.5 models and the o3 models had systematically different assessments, with o3 models (in the inside view) favoring higher "Decreases" probabilities.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **B** | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |

**This Forecast Grade: B-**

Rationale: Research quality was excellent, with strong Google Trends data, comprehensive news coverage, and a well-targeted agentic search. Three of five forecasters (S2-1, S2-2, S2-5) produced reasonable distributions broadly consistent with the evidence. However, one severe outlier (S2-4 at 15/40/45) and one moderate outlier (S2-3 at 10/63/27) dragged the ensemble toward an over-weighted "Decreases" probability. The final prediction of 70.2% "Doesn't change" is likely 10-15pp too low given the 92% base rate, the +/-3 threshold generosity (allowing the value to range from 2-8), the stabilization at 5, and the absence of catalysts. The 20.2% "Decreases" probability is likely too high because it requires near-complete disappearance of search interest (to 0-1) despite the recent Epstein scandal providing residual ambient awareness. The ensemble aggregation mechanism (simple average) was insufficient to handle the outlier, and a median or trimmed-mean aggregation would have produced a better calibrated result.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Add conditional base rates.** The 92% "Doesn't change" base rate includes long stretches at 0 where decreases >3 are structurally impossible. For Google Trends questions, the pipeline should compute base rates conditional on the starting value range (e.g., "when starting from 3-7, what percentage of 8-day windows show >3 point changes?"). This would give forecasters a more relevant anchor and reduce the wide divergence in base-rate adjustments seen here.

2. **Include decay-rate analysis for post-spike periods.** For questions where a recent spike has occurred, the research phase should explicitly quantify the typical decay trajectory (e.g., average time to return to baseline, half-life of interest). This was left to individual forecasters to estimate, leading to inconsistent assumptions.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Consider outlier detection or robust aggregation.** Simple averaging amplifies outlier damage. S2-4's [15/40/45] pulled the ensemble significantly. A trimmed mean (dropping the highest and lowest) or median aggregation would have produced approximately [10/75/15] instead of [9.6/70.2/20.2] -- a more defensible result given the evidence.

2. **Strengthen calibration checklist for extreme claims.** S2-4 asserted "Decreases" as the most likely outcome despite it contradicting the base rate, the stabilization evidence, and the majority of other forecasters. The prompt could include a specific check: "If your most likely outcome differs from the base rate's most likely outcome, provide explicit quantitative evidence for this reversal."

3. **Query generation should not produce forecasts.** The `query_historical.md` output includes probability estimates (60/20/20). The prompt for query generation should explicitly instruct the LLM to generate queries only, not preliminary forecasts.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Best-performing models in this forecast. S2-1 produced the most thorough and well-calibrated analysis (15/16). S2-2 handled cross-pollinated input appropriately. The Sonnet 4.5 models showed good judgment in weighting the stabilization evidence and threshold mechanics.

- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** Analytically sophisticated (good base-rate distortion reasoning in S1-3) but poorly calibrated. The magnitude of adjustments from the base rate was consistently too large. The inside view update went in the wrong direction, decreasing confidence in stability despite confirmatory evidence.

- **o3 (Forecasters 4-5):** Mixed performance. S1-4 was methodologically strong (Dirichlet smoothing). But S2-4 produced the forecast's most problematic output, asserting "Decreases" as most likely based on an unsupported empirical claim. S2-5 was reasonable but still over-weighted "Decreases" relative to the evidence. The o3 models appear to have a systematic bias toward expecting continued decay in post-spike scenarios, even when the evidence shows stabilization.
