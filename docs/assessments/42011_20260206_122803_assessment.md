# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent report failed to produce the requested 5-day return distribution | High | Research | The agentic search was asked for "NVDA historical 5-day price change distribution since 2015" but after 7 steps and $0.31 spent, explicitly stated "the raw files have not yet been downloaded, so the complete 2015-2026 rolling 5-session return series has still not been calculated." The most critical quantitative base rate for this question was never delivered. |
| Price data inconsistency across sources | Med | Research | Multiple closing prices reported for Feb 5, 2026: $171.88 (GuruFocus, Stockpulse, CNN), $177.74 (Parameter), $187.88 (Agent report). The $187.88 figure in the agent report appears to be stale (possibly from an earlier date), and some forecasters anchored on it. |
| Fabricated or unverified base rate statistics (S1-4 and S1-5) | Med | S1-4, S1-5 | Both o3 instances cited specific base rates (S1-4: "57% positive return, mean +2.3%, sigma 12%"; S1-5: "56%, mean +2.1%, sigma 9%") and claimed these were "empirical" from "earlier work on that series" or from "2,900+ observations." These statistics were not present in any research artifact and appear to be model-generated estimates presented as data. |
| Calendar disagreement on Feb 14 trading status | Low | S1-3, S1-4, S2-3, S2-5 | Several forecasters noted that Feb 14, 2026 is a Saturday, implying the effective comparison is with Feb 13's close. Others treated Feb 14 as a trading day. Feb 14, 2026 is indeed a Saturday, so the question likely resolves to the Feb 13 close. This is a minor issue since the resolution criteria say "latest market close price" which would default to the last available close. |
| AskNews deep research failed with 403 error | Low | Research | AskNews deep research hit usage limit. Regular AskNews search returned 19 relevant articles, so impact was limited. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. `Nvidia scheduled earnings date 2026` (Google)
2. `NVDA stock news February 2026` (Google News)
3. `Provide NVDA historical 5-day price change distribution since 2015, identify catalysts between 6-Feb-2026 and 14-Feb-2026, and summarize analyst expectations` (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. `NVDA price target February 2026` (Google)
2. `Nvidia latest news February 2026` (Google News)
3. `Provide February 2026 news on Nvidia's data center AI chip demand, supply constraints, and regulatory issues worldwide` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Background catalysts, earnings schedule, base rates | Recent news, analyst targets, regulatory developments |
| Content type | Event calendars, fundamental data, historical returns | News articles, policy developments, market sentiment |
| Unique contribution | Confirmed earnings date (Feb 25, outside window), established no company-specific catalyst in window | Surfaced H200 export uncertainty, memory shortage news, after-hours recovery signals, macro calendar |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries correctly targeted the earnings calendar and base rate establishment, while current queries focused on recent catalysts and sentiment.
- The most critical query was the agent request for the 5-day return distribution. This was the single most valuable piece of information for this question type, and the agent failed to deliver it after 7 steps. The agent acknowledged the data existed (Barchart, EODData) but could not download and process it. This is a significant pipeline limitation -- the agentic search cannot execute data downloads or run computations, only search and summarize.
- The yFinance tool was used (visible in tool_usage.json step 1) but its output is not clearly surfaced in the research artifacts. The agent report references Barchart performance data (recent 5-day return of -10.72%) but not a full distribution.
- The AskNews query returned 19 articles, many highly relevant to NVDA's recent price action, export negotiations, and production issues. This was the strongest source of current information.
- Google searches were somewhat generic ("NVDA stock news February 2026") but yielded useful Motley Fool articles with earnings dates and analyst estimates.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The query generation analysis in `query_historical.md` includes forecasting-adjacent language ("a base-rate view of how NVDA typically moves") which is appropriate for the research framing. The agent report stayed factual, listing catalysts and data gaps rather than making predictions. The AskNews articles contain some analyst targets and technical analysis that border on forecasts, but these are appropriately attributed to named sources.

However, several article summaries contain opinionated language from Motley Fool authors ("stock will soar," "no-brainer buy") which the summarizer should ideally flag more clearly as low-weight opinion.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** (1) Earnings date confirmed as Feb 25, outside the window. (2) Five consecutive down days totaling -10.72%. (3) H200 export license uncertainty with KYC terms. (4) Memory shortage causing GPU production delays. (5) Multiple specific prices across the recent decline. (6) Macro catalysts in window: payrolls Feb 11, CPI Feb 13. (7) Alphabet $175-185B capex announcement as positive signal.
- **Critical information missed:** The requested 5-day return distribution was never computed. This is the single most important base rate for a "will stock price be higher" question. Without it, forecasters had to guess or fabricate base rates.
- **Source quality:** Mixed. Market data sources (GuruFocus, Stockpulse, CNBC) were high quality. Motley Fool articles were opinion-heavy. The agent report was thorough in listing catalysts but failed on its core quantitative task. AskNews provided the richest set of recent articles.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough and well-organized. Each source evaluated individually with quality ratings and clear separation of fact vs. opinion. Correctly identifies the agent report and recent price action as most relevant. Notes the Motley Fool's prediction as "opinion" with "low weight." (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 reference classes: (1) all 5-day NVDA periods, (2) 5-day periods after >5% declines, (3) non-earnings periods, (4) high-volatility regimes. Selects a combination of #2 and #3. Good reasoning about the current oversold condition. (3/4 -- correct classes but no empirical data to support any of them)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 6 trading days. Lists specific catalysts (Feb 11 jobs, Feb 13 CPI, H200 license). Pro-rates AI model target ($196-199 by Feb 28) to estimate ~2% expected gain over 6 days. This pro-rating is methodologically questionable (stock returns are not linear) but at least attempts quantitative anchoring. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts with "mean reversion baseline: 57%" but this number is not sourced from any research artifact. Applies several adjustments (macro uncertainty -5%, analyst targets +3%, sector headwinds -3%) arriving at 52%. The adjustments are reasonable in direction but arbitrary in magnitude. (2/4 -- the 57% anchor appears fabricated)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Considers both Yes and No pathways clearly. Scenario analysis (positive macro 40%, neutral 30%, negative 30%) is a good approach. Final 52% is internally consistent with the stated reasoning.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Similar quality to S1-1. Each source evaluated with quality ratings. Correctly identifies key facts and separates opinion. Notes the conflict between negative momentum and oversold conditions. (3/4 -- slightly less detailed than S1-1)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 5 reference classes, including NVDA returns following sharp 5-day declines. Good thinking, but again no empirical data to anchor on. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 6 trading days. Good analysis of starting condition, catalysts, and volatility. Notes short-term AI model targets as context. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts with "Random walk baseline: 50%" and makes explicit arithmetic adjustments: momentum -8%, oversold bounce +5%, analyst confidence +2%, macro uncertainty -3% = 46%. This is more systematic than S1-1 but equally arbitrary. The -8% momentum penalty is the largest single adjustment and drives the bearish conclusion. (2/4)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Clear consideration of both pathways. The 46% prediction is the most bearish of the outside views, driven primarily by the momentum penalty. Internally consistent.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent critical evaluation. For each source, explicitly separates factual claims from opinions and assesses quality. Correctly notes that none of the sources provide the key base rate statistic (historical 5-day up frequency). States: "None of the provided sources actually give the key statistic we'd want." This is the most honest assessment of the research quality. (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes: (1) NVDA rolling 5-6 day returns, (2) large-cap US equities, (3) high-vol mega-cap tech. Correctly selects #2/#3 as practical stand-ins since #1 data was not computed. Explicitly acknowledges the limitation: "We do not have the computed distribution." (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies ~6 trading sessions. Notes that for volatile single stocks, the sign probability is "closer to a coin flip" than for indices. Sound reasoning about drift vs. noise. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchors on ~53% (coin flip + small equity drift) for "stock up over ~1 trading week." Adjusts to 54% based on mild positive drift but acknowledges substantial noise. Explicitly states "calibration should stay conservative and close to 50%." This is the most epistemically honest derivation among the five. (4/4)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Both pathways considered. The 54% prediction explicitly reflects uncertainty rather than false precision. Notably, this is the only forecaster that acknowledges the absence of a hard tether (actual historical frequency data).

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and efficient. Groups sources by quality tier. Correctly notes opinion vs. fact distinctions. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies NVDA 5-day returns since 2015 as most suitable. Claims "roughly 2,770 overlapping 5-day periods" with "fraction positive return approximately 57%, mean +2.3%, median +1.1%, sigma 12%." These specific statistics are not present in any research artifact. The phrasing "pulled earlier this week from Barchart and confirmed by the agent note" is misleading -- the agent report explicitly says the distribution was NOT computed. This appears to be model-generated data presented as empirical. (2/4 -- good selection but fabricated data)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly notes Feb 14 is a non-trading day (Saturday), so effective comparison is Feb 6 to Feb 13 close = 5 trading sessions. Good observation about macro data timing. Notes momentum and volatility clustering adjustments are small (<2pp). (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses the claimed 57% as anchor. Makes small adjustments for market regime (+1pp) and momentum (-1pp), netting to 57%. Well-structured calibration table. (3/4 -- would be 4/4 if the base rate were genuine)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Both pathways considered implicitly through the base rate framework. The 57% prediction is the most bullish outside view, driven by the (likely fabricated) 57% historical base rate.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise, correctly summarized. Notes agent report supplies rolling 5-day return data but correctly identifies quality as "medium-high." (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same 3 options as S1-4 (NVDA, S&P, Mag-7). Selects NVDA 5-day returns. Claims "P(5-day return > 0) approximately 56%, mean +2.1%, median +0.8%, sigma 9%" from "earlier work on that series." Again, these statistics are not in the research artifacts. (2/4 -- same fabrication issue)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 5 trading sessions. Notes that after weekly drops >8%, NVDA has shown positive returns ~60% of the time (n~60 since 2015). This specific claim is not sourced and may be fabricated, but the direction (mean reversion after large drops) is plausible. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from 56%, adds +4pp for oversold/mean-reversion, subtracts -3pp for macro headline risk, adds +1pp for H200 license asymmetry (approval more likely than denial). Arrives at 57%. (3/4)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Both pathways considered. The +1pp for H200 license asymmetry is a unique and interesting adjustment. The 57% prediction matches S1-4.

- **Score:** 11/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 52% | 12/16 | Detailed source analysis, scenario framework | Unsourced 57% mean reversion anchor |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 46% | 11/16 | Systematic arithmetic adjustments | Arbitrary -8% momentum penalty; most bearish with weakest justification for magnitude |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 54% | 15/16 | Honest about data gaps; conservative calibration | Could have pushed harder on mean reversion given oversold condition |
| S1-4 | o3 | 57% | 12/16 | Calendar correction (Feb 14 = Saturday); structured calibration | Presents fabricated statistics as empirical data |
| S1-5 | o3 | 57% | 11/16 | H200 license asymmetry observation; mean reversion after big drops | Same fabrication issue as S1-4; less transparent about data source |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 52% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 57% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 46% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 54% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 57% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Thorough Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied to current news. Strong evidence includes 5-day -10.72% decline and oversold RSI. Correctly identifies memory shortage as "bearish (structural constraint, not quickly resolved)." Distinguishes between gaming segment (smaller revenue) and data center. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 52% -> Output: 55%. Delta: +3pp. The upward shift is justified by oversold bounce potential (+3%), after-hours buying signals (+2%), technical support (+1%), Alphabet capex (+1%), offset by production constraints (-2%), sector rotation (-1%), macro uncertainty (-1%). Net +3pp. Well-structured but the individual adjustments are arbitrary. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed explicitly: if halved to 3 days, probability decreases to ~48% (momentum dominates); if doubled to 12 days, increases to ~58% (more time for bounce, approaches earnings). Good analysis. (4/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed fully. Paraphrase correct. Base rate alignment stated. Consistency check ("55 out of 100 times"). Key evidence listed. Blind spot identified (macro data surprises). Status quo analysis done. (4/4)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (upward from 52%) matches the evidence direction (oversold bounce more prominent in inside view). Final 55% is internally consistent with stated reasoning.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Extensive and well-organized. Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Uniquely notes the price inconsistency between sources ($171.88 vs $177.74 vs $187.88). The most detail-oriented evidence analysis of all five forecasters. Correctly identifies the Feb 6 memory shortage news as "breaking news that market hasn't fully digested." (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 57% -> Output: 43%. Delta: -14pp. This is the largest shift of any forecaster. Justified by: negative momentum -9pp, memory shortage news -4pp, technical breakdown -2pp, offset by capex optimism +1pp. The -9pp momentum penalty is derived from claimed historical analysis ("when NVDA enters a 5-day window already down >8% in prior 5 days, the subsequent 5-day up-probability drops to ~48%"). This specific claim is not in the research artifacts. (2/4 -- magnitude is aggressive and partially based on unsourced claims)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed: halved to 2-3 days would lower to ~45%; doubled to 10 days would drift back to 55-57%. Good analysis. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Paraphrase correct. Base rate clearly stated (57% adjusted to 43%). Consistency check done. Top evidence listed with quality ratings. Blind spot: surprise massive GPU order. Status quo: "recent status quo is DOWN." (4/4)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction is downward, driven by fresh negative news (memory shortage) not present in the outside view context. This is a legitimate inside-view update. However, the -14pp total shift is the most aggressive of all forecasters and the momentum-based adjustment relies on unsourced statistics.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured evidence analysis covering Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Notes export/license uncertainty as the main headline risk. Correctly identifies broad tech selling as a factor. Oversold/200DMA support treated as moderate evidence. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 46% -> Output: 52%. Delta: +6pp. Moves upward from the most bearish outside view. Justification: the oversold bounce case is "better supported than the gaming-delay negative," and the slightly shorter effective window (5 vs 6 trading days) makes it "closer to a coin flip." The adjustment is well-reasoned: -3pp for export/selling pressure, +3pp for oversold mean reversion, net 0pp from OpenAI negative vs capex positive. Starting from a 52% base rate (equity drift) rather than the received 46%. (3/4 -- partially ignores the received S1-2 input by resetting to a 52% base)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Halving would lean more "No"; doubling would lean more "Yes" due to increased catalyst probability. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present. Notes calendar correction (Feb 14 likely = Feb 13 close). Key evidence listed. Blind spot: single decisive export headline. Status quo analysis: "modest mean reversion toward 'slightly up' is plausible." (3/4)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The 52% prediction is interesting: it essentially discards the S1-2 bearish prior (46%) and resets to a near-neutral position. The forecaster explicitly starts from "a short-horizon 'up-week' base rate for a large U.S. stock: ~52%" rather than anchoring on the received 46%. This partially undermines the cross-pollination mechanism.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structure. Categorizes sources by date and quality. Correctly identifies Reuters H200 reporting as highest quality. Notes that gaming GPU delays are "second-order versus data center demand." Identifies export/license story as "genuine near-term headline risk" that is "two-sided." (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 54% -> Output: 49%. Delta: -5pp. Deductions: -3pp for negative news flow (export/license, GPU delay), -2pp for momentum/selling pressure, -1pp for sector weakness, +2pp for technical oversold/200-day support. Net -4pp to 50%, then -1pp more for "asymmetric headline risk." (3/4 -- well-structured but the extra -1pp feels like fine-tuning noise)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Halving: probability drops a couple points (trend dominates). Doubling: rises a few points (more mean-reversion time). (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated (54%). Consistency: "49 out of 100 times the 14 Feb close beats 6 Feb close." Key evidence listed. Blind spot: surprise positive headline. Status quo: "stay close to 50%." (3/4)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction downward from 54%, justified by current negative news flow. The 49% prediction is just below the 50% threshold, suggesting the forecaster sees this as essentially a coin flip with a very slight bearish lean. Internally consistent.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured in Strong/Moderate/Weak. Historical base rate (56%) treated as strong. Mean reversion after >8% drops (~60%) as strong. Oversold technicals and license news as moderate. Negative sentiment and RTX delay as weak. Good categorization noting gaming is <15% of revenue. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 57% -> Output: 59%. Delta: +2pp. Adjustments from base rate 56%: +3pp mean reversion, +2pp license headline likely positive, -2pp macro/tech risk. Net +3pp to 59%. This is the most bullish final prediction. The +2pp for H200 license ("administration publicly 'willing' to approve") is a reasonable inside-view update but may overweight a single policy signal. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. Halving: nudges toward 50-52%. Doubling: introduces earnings run-up, raising to low 60s. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Paraphrase correct. Base rate 56%. Consistency: "59/100 times the price ends higher next week." Key evidence listed (5 items). Blind spot: hot CPI could drag below $168. Status quo: "slight upward drift despite recent drop." (3/4)

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction upward, consistent with mean reversion thesis. The 59% is the most bullish prediction and contrasts sharply with S2-2's 43%. The difference primarily comes from how each forecaster weights momentum (S2-2 weights it heavily negative) vs. mean reversion (S2-5 weights it heavily positive).

- **Score:** 12/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 52% | 55% | +3pp | 14/16 | Yes -- oversold bounce with structured adjustments |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 57% | 43% | -14pp | 13/16 | Partial -- direction justified by fresh news but magnitude relies on unsourced statistics |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 46% | 52% | +6pp | 12/16 | Partial -- resets to own base rate rather than updating from received input |
| S2-4 | o3 | 54% | 49% | -5pp | 12/16 | Yes -- measured downward shift for current headwinds |
| S2-5 | o3 | 57% | 59% | +2pp | 12/16 | Partial -- slight bullish update justified but may overweight license asymmetry |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 <- o3 S1-4):** Received the most bullish outside view (57%) and produced the most bearish inside view (43%), a dramatic -14pp reversal. This is the most impactful cross-pollination instance. S2-2 explicitly engaged with the received input but overrode it based on fresh negative news (memory shortage, momentum). The reversal demonstrates genuine independent analysis rather than anchoring. However, the magnitude of the shift is extreme for inside-view updates and partially relies on unsourced historical claims.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 <- Sonnet 4.5 S1-2):** Received the most bearish outside view (46%) and moved it upward to 52%. However, the forecaster appeared to largely discard the received input, resetting to a "52% base rate for a large U.S. stock" rather than updating from 46%. The cross-pollinated input had minimal influence on the final output.

- **S2-4 (o3 <- GPT-5.2 S1-3):** Received 54% and adjusted to 49%, a modest -5pp shift. The update was measured and well-justified by current news. Good engagement with the received input.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 made a modest +3pp upward adjustment from its own prior. S2-5 made a small +2pp upward adjustment. Both self-model instances shifted upward, consistent with mean reversion reasoning from current evidence.

- **Overall:** Cross-pollination had significant diversification effect in this forecast. The 16pp spread (43% to 59%) is the largest of any dimension. S2-2's dramatic reversal from its received 57% input is notable -- it shows genuine analytical independence. However, S2-3 largely ignored its received input, weakening that particular cross-pollination pathway. The mechanism produced useful diversity but also contributed to the wide spread, reflecting genuine analytical disagreement about whether momentum or mean reversion dominates in the short term.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: compare Feb 14 close to Feb 6 close.
- S1-3, S1-4, and S2-3 correctly identified that Feb 14, 2026 is a Saturday, meaning the effective comparison uses the most recent prior trading day close (likely Feb 13). Other forecasters treated it as a regular trading day. The resolution criteria state "latest market close price on 2026-02-14" which would resolve to the last available close.
- All forecasters correctly identified the ~5-6 trading day window and the absence of NVDA earnings within the period.

### Factual Consensus

1. NVDA had declined approximately 10.72% over the 5 trading days ending Feb 5, 2026
2. NVDA earnings are scheduled for Feb 25, 2026 -- outside the forecast window
3. H200 export license negotiations with China remain unresolved, with KYC terms disputed
4. Two macro catalysts fall within the window: payrolls (Feb 11) and CPI (Feb 13)
5. NVDA trading near 200-day moving average support around $168

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Fabricated base rate | Cited "57% positive return, mean +2.3%, sigma 12%" as empirical data "pulled earlier this week from Barchart" -- this was not present in any research artifact; agent report explicitly stated distribution was not computed | Medium -- the 57% anchor influenced S1-4's prediction and was passed to S2-2 |
| S1-5 | Fabricated base rate | Cited "P(5-day return > 0) approximately 56%, mean +2.1%, sigma 9%" from "earlier work on that series" -- also not in research artifacts | Medium -- same issue as S1-4 |
| Agent report | Stale price data | Referenced "$187.88 on Feb 5" which conflicts with the $171.88 close reported by multiple other sources | Medium -- S1-1 anchored on $187.88 for its short-term target analysis |
| S2-2 | Unsourced momentum statistic | Claimed "when NVDA enters a 5-day window already down >8%, the subsequent 5-day up-probability drops to ~48%" -- not in any research artifact | Low-Medium -- drove the largest single adjustment (-9pp) |
| S1-3 | Calendar correction | Noted Feb 14 is a Saturday; the Motley Fool source also stated Feb 25 earnings "falls between" Feb 6 and Feb 14, which was corrected in the source note | Low -- correctly identified by the forecaster |

### Hallucinations

Both o3 instances (S1-4 and S1-5) presented specific statistical values as empirical data when the research explicitly stated the distribution was not computed. The language "pulled earlier this week from Barchart and confirmed by the agent note" (S1-4) is particularly misleading since the agent note says the opposite. S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5) also cited a specific conditional probability (48% after >8% drops) without sourcing. While the approximate magnitudes are plausible based on general financial knowledge, presenting them as computed empirical values is a form of hallucination.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Good query generation and research breadth.** The historical queries correctly targeted earnings schedule and base rates, while current queries surfaced the most relevant recent developments (H200 export, memory shortage, macro calendar). The AskNews search returned 19 highly relevant articles covering the recent price decline from multiple angles.

2. **S1-3 (GPT-5.2) demonstrated exemplary epistemic humility.** It was the only forecaster to honestly state that the key base rate was missing from the research and to calibrate conservatively as a result, rather than fabricating statistics. Its 54% prediction with explicit uncertainty acknowledgment was the most well-justified outside view.

3. **Diverse analytical perspectives produced meaningful spread.** The ensemble captured the genuine analytical tension between momentum (bearish) and mean reversion (bullish) for a stock that had declined 10.72% in 5 days. Forecasters ranging from 43% to 59% represent a legitimate disagreement that the 51.6% average reasonably resolves.

4. **Comprehensive catalyst identification.** All forecasters identified the key upcoming events (payrolls Feb 11, CPI Feb 13, H200 license, earnings Feb 25) and correctly assessed their relevance to the 5-6 day window. The Feb 14 = Saturday observation by three forecasters shows good attention to detail.

5. **Structured calibration checklists.** All Step 2 outputs completed the checklist with paraphrase, base rate, consistency check, key evidence, blind spot, and status quo analysis. S2-1 was particularly thorough.

### Weaknesses

1. **Agent report failed on its core task.** The most valuable piece of research -- the 5-day return distribution -- was explicitly requested but never delivered after 7 steps and $0.31 of agentic search cost. The agent correctly identified the data sources but could not download and process them. This is a fundamental limitation for stock price questions.

2. **Two forecasters fabricated base rate statistics.** S1-4 and S1-5 (both o3) presented specific statistics as empirical data when the research explicitly stated the data was not computed. This undermines trust in those outputs and could propagate errors through the pipeline.

3. **Price data inconsistency went partially unresolved.** The agent report cited $187.88 as the Feb 5 close while multiple other sources reported $171.88. S2-2 was the only forecaster to explicitly note this discrepancy. Others anchored on potentially incorrect price levels without cross-checking.

4. **Wide spread reflects genuine uncertainty but also analytical inconsistency.** The 16pp spread (43-59%) is largely driven by different weights placed on momentum vs. mean reversion. This is a legitimate analytical disagreement, but the specific magnitudes of adjustments are arbitrary -- S2-2's -9pp momentum penalty vs. S2-5's +3pp mean reversion bonus are not grounded in data.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **B** | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |

**This Forecast Grade: B-**

Rationale: The research phase was comprehensive for news and catalysts but critically failed on the quantitative base rate. The ensemble produced a reasonable final prediction (51.6%) that appropriately reflects the high uncertainty of short-horizon stock price prediction. S1-3 (GPT-5.2) was outstanding in its epistemic honesty. However, the fabricated statistics from two o3 instances and the agent's failure to deliver the key distribution are notable weaknesses. The wide 16pp spread reflects genuine analytical disagreement that the equal-weighted average resolves sensibly but could benefit from better shared quantitative anchoring. The final prediction of 51.6% is defensible for a question that is fundamentally close to a coin flip with slight adjustments for current conditions.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Add a yFinance-based historical return distribution tool.** For stock price questions of the form "will price be higher on date X than date Y," the pipeline should automatically compute the historical N-day return distribution for the relevant ticker. This was the single most important piece of missing information and the agentic search cannot fill this gap because it cannot execute computations. A dedicated tool that downloads historical prices via yFinance and computes rolling return statistics would solve this.

2. **Cross-validate price data across sources.** The $187.88 vs $171.88 discrepancy suggests the agent report may have been working with stale data. When multiple sources report prices, the pipeline should flag inconsistencies.

3. **Handle AskNews deep research failures gracefully.** The 403 error was logged but the regular search returned 19 articles, minimizing impact. Still, retry logic or fallback should be implemented.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Explicitly instruct forecasters not to fabricate base rate statistics.** The prompt should include language like: "Only cite statistics that are present in the provided research context. If the key base rate data is not available, state this explicitly and calibrate conservatively around the 50% prior for stock price questions." This would prevent the o3 hallucination pattern observed here.

2. **For stock price questions, consider providing a standard preamble.** For "will stock be higher" binary questions, the pipeline could automatically include: the current price (from yFinance), the N-day return distribution statistics, and basic technical indicators (200-day MA, RSI). This would give all forecasters a shared quantitative foundation.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** Produced the strongest outside view (15/16) with exemplary epistemic honesty about missing data. Its conservative 54% was well-justified. The inside view update (46% -> 52%) partially ignored the received input by resetting to its own base rate, which weakens the cross-pollination mechanism.
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Solid overall. S2-1 was the most thorough on the calibration checklist. S2-2 produced the most dramatic cross-pollination reversal (57% -> 43%) which, while aggressive, showed genuine independent analysis. S2-2 was also the only forecaster to explicitly flag the price data inconsistency.
- **o3 (Forecasters 4-5):** Both instances fabricated base rate statistics in the outside view, which is a significant reliability concern. The calendar correction (Feb 14 = Saturday) and the H200 license asymmetry observation were valuable contributions. S2-4's measured -5pp adjustment was well-calibrated. S2-5 was the most bullish at 59%, driven by mean reversion and license optimism.

|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp (binary) | No | 16pp spread (43-59%); notable but below threshold |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates directionally defensible given stated reasoning |
| Factual errors present | Yes | Price data inconsistency ($187.88 vs $171.88); fabricated base rates |
| Hallucinations detected | Yes | S1-4 and S1-5 presented fabricated statistics as empirical; S2-2 cited unsourced conditional probability |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | S2-2 showed dramatic independent analysis; S2-3 largely ignored received input; S2-4 engaged well |
| Critical info missed in research | Yes | 5-day return distribution -- the key quantitative base rate -- was requested but never delivered |
| Base rate calculation errors | Yes | No calculation per se, but fabricated base rates by S1-4 and S1-5 |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | No | S2-2 (43%) and S2-5 (59%) are the extremes but within ~1.5 SD of mean 51.6% given SD of ~6pp |
