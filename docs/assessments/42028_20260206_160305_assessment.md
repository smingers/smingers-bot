## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecasters 1 & 2 failed to extract probabilities | Critical | S2-1, S2-2 | Both Sonnet 4.5 instances used a non-standard format (`**Probabilities:** [38, 42, 20, 0]`) that the extractor could not parse. Only 3 of 5 forecasters contributed to aggregation, reducing ensemble diversity. |
| "Other" assigned 13% by S1-5 | Medium | S1-5 | Forecaster 5's outside view assigned 13% to "Other" (Conservatives, minor parties), far above any evidence-supported level. This inflated Other and compressed the main contenders' probabilities. |
| Greens assigned 40% win probability by S2-2 | Medium | S2-2 (failed) | Forecaster 2's inside view assigned Greens 40% (bookmaker-led reasoning), making them the favorite despite no poll showing Greens leading. Would have significantly shifted final aggregation had extraction succeeded. |
| Inconsistent outside view predictions | Medium | S1-1 through S1-5 | Labour outside view ranged from 47% to 60%, Reform from 21% to 41%, Greens from 10% to 18%. This 13pp spread on Labour and 20pp spread on Reform suggests weak consensus on base rates. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. Gorton Denton by-election 2026 polling (Google)
2. Reform UK campaign Gorton Denton (Google News)
3. Provide detailed background and historical by-election swings in safe Labour seats, candidate list, demographics, local issues for 2026 Gorton and Denton by-election, including impact of Burnham's blocked candidacy and national polling context (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. 2026 Gorton Denton byelection candidates (Google)
2. Gorton and Denton by-election polling (Google News)
3. Provide latest 2026 Gorton and Denton by-election campaign coverage, candidate list, polling and party chances published since January 2026 (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Mixed - queries 1-2 don't enforce historical framing | Recent campaign coverage (Jan-Feb 2026) |
| Content type | Base rates, demographics, historical swings via agent | Candidates, polling, campaign dynamics |
| Unique contribution | Agent report providing rich historical by-election analysis | AskNews surfaced 20+ recent articles with campaign details |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets have moderate overlap. Both include "polling" queries and "Gorton Denton" candidate searches, reducing discreteness.
- Historical queries were well-served by the agent report which provided excellent context on Copeland, Hartlepool, Runcorn precedents and detailed demographics.
- Current queries surfaced rich campaign-level detail including Farage visit, Goodwin's candidacy controversies, Vince Cable tactical voting call, and bookmaker odds.
- Critical information gap: no constituency-level polling existed, which is acknowledged across sources. The research correctly identified MRP projections as the best available proxy.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The historical research agent report includes PollCheck Monte Carlo simulation results (Labour 54%, Reform 38%, Green 8%) which are essentially probability forecasts. However, these are appropriately sourced from a quantitative model rather than being the agent's own predictions, so this is acceptable. The article summaries remain appropriately factual.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** Complete candidate list (11 candidates), 2024 baseline results, three MRP projections, historical by-election swing precedents, Workers Party withdrawal, Burnham veto dynamics, bookmaker odds, demographic split between Tameside and Manchester wards, Caerphilly precedent, Vince Cable tactical voting call.
- **Critical information missed:** Nothing obvious; the research was comprehensive for a question with no constituency polling.
- **Source quality:** Strong mix of academic analysis (The Conversation), major outlets (Independent, Guardian, BBC, Al Jazeera), and specialized election analysis (PollCheck). The agent report provided an excellent synthesis.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all 7 sources with quality ratings, clear distinction between facts and opinions. Correctly identifies Louise Thompson as strongest expert source.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 reference classes and chooses "Recent Labour-held by-elections under unpopular Labour governments" with good justification. Correctly highlights Runcorn & Helsby as most comparable.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 20-day window and notes tactical voting crystallizes in final 10 days.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear arithmetic from 2024 baseline with adjustments for national swing (-15% Lab), Workers redistribution, and Burnham penalty. Arrives at Labour ~35% vote share estimate then translates to win probability.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Assigns probabilities to all 4 options summing to 100%.
- Considers three-way dynamic and how split vote affects win probability vs vote share.
- Final prediction (Lab 47%, Reform 38%, Green 13%, Other 2%) is reasonable and well-justified.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Very similar to S1-1 but less detailed. Adequate coverage.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses same class as S1-1. Less explicit about alternatives considered.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Adequate. Notes most dynamics already in play.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses PollCheck Monte Carlo as anchor, references class 2 as "safe seat" with 87% hold rate, adjusts for current climate.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options assigned, sum to 100%.
- Final prediction (Lab 47%, Reform 41%, Green 11%, Other 1%) slightly more bullish on Reform than S1-1.
- Reasoning is sound but less original than S1-1.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Methodical assessment with quality ratings for each source. Good distinction of fact vs opinion. Correctly identifies bookmaker odds as important but notes no poll shows Greens leading.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considers 4 classes, chooses "Recent Labour-held by-elections" as backbone with multi-party fragmentation adjustment. Sound reasoning.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Brief but adequate. Notes 20 days, limited time for shifts, most data already available.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts with a 60% Labour prior from "safe seat" base rate, then applies multiplicative risk factors. Arrives at Labour 58%, Reform 30%, Green 10%, Other 2%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options assigned, sum to 100%.
- More conservative than other forecasters on Reform (30%) and Green (10%), keeping Labour as clear favorite.
- The step-by-step multiplicative risk factor approach is transparent and reproducible.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Most rigorous source analysis of all five. Explicitly rates each source's quality and carefully separates facts from opinions. Notes agent report is "hypothesis-generating" rather than definitive.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent. Identifies three reference classes with specific numbers: all Labour by-elections since 1945 (87% hold), mid-term slump by-elections (45% hold), and safe-seat upsets. Chooses #2 as backbone and adjusts for current extreme context.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Cites Curtice 2015 study on median late swing of ~2pts. Sophisticated treatment of what information is already priced in.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Most methodical. Starts from reference class 2 (87% hold), applies multiplicative risk inflators (national collapse x2.0, Burnham x1.3, volatility x1.2), derives 40% non-Labour probability. Then splits the upset bucket 27/13/2 for Reform/Green/Other.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options assigned, sum to 100%.
- Prediction (Lab 60%, Reform 25%, Green 13%, Other 2%) is the most Labour-bullish outside view.
- The systematic approach to deriving probabilities is the strongest of all five.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Detailed but less distinctive. Adequate evaluation of all sources.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses reference class 2 (mid-term governing-party by-elections, 45% hold), which is a different and arguably better-calibrated anchor than the "87% safe seat" class used by S1-4. Adjusts for cushion (+10pp), extreme national polling (-15pp), and multi-party split (+8pp).
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Brief but notes 2/3 of eventual swing already visible.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Arrives at Labour 48%, then splits upset bucket. Unusual choice to assign 13% to "Other" initially from a historical calculation, then later corrects. Final outside view: Lab 48%, Reform 21%, Green 18%, Other 13%.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- All options sum to 100%.
- The 13% to "Other" is poorly justified - Conservatives and minor parties are polling below 5% combined with no path to victory. This over-allocation compresses the main contenders.
- Reform at 21% seems too low given MRP data showing them leading in 2/3 polls.

- **Score:** 10/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Lab/Ref/Grn/Oth) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|-------------------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 47/38/13/2 | 14/16 | Clear arithmetic from baseline | Slightly formulaic |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 47/41/11/1 | 12/16 | Good use of PollCheck anchor | Less original than S1-1 |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 58/30/10/2 | 13/16 | Transparent multiplicative approach | Conservative on Reform/Green |
| S1-4 | o3 | 60/25/13/2 | 15/16 | Most rigorous methodology | Labour-bullish may underweight current data |
| S1-5 | o3 | 48/21/18/13 | 10/16 | Good reference class choice | 13% Other is poorly justified |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (Lab/Ref/Grn/Oth) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 47/38/13/2 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 60/25/13/2 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 47/41/11/1 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 58/30/10/2 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 48/21/18/13 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1 — EXTRACTION FAILED

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses Strong/Moderate/Weak framework extensively. Identifies 12 evidence items with clear directional impact. Particularly strong on the Caerphilly precedent and MRP evidence.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Lab 47/Ref 38/Grn 13/Oth 2 -> Output: Lab 38/Ref 42/Grn 20/Oth 0. Delta: Lab -9, Ref +4, Grn +7, Oth -2. The update direction (Lab down, Ref up, Grn up) is correct given MRP evidence and bookmaker data.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Provides specific probability estimates for halved (10-day) and doubled (40-day) horizons - a strong treatment.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completes all elements. Paraphrase correct, base rate stated, consistency check done, blind spot identified (Green surge scenario).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Updates preserve sum = 100%.
- Relative adjustments between options are sensible: biggest update is pushing Greens from 13% to 20% based on Workers Party redistribution and bookmaker signal.
- However, output format used `**Probabilities:** [38, 42, 20, 0]` instead of the expected per-option format, causing extraction failure.

- **Score:** 13/16 (reasoning quality), but **extraction failure nullifies contribution**

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4 — EXTRACTION FAILED

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong framework application with 12 evidence items across Strong/Moderate/Weak tiers. Notably weights bookmaker odds heavily, citing them as "strong market intelligence."
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Lab 60/Ref 25/Grn 13/Oth 2 -> Output: Lab 35/Ref 23/Grn 40/Oth 2. Delta: Lab -25, Ref -2, Grn +27, Oth 0. This is a dramatic shift, moving Greens to favorite status based heavily on bookmaker odds and the Caerphilly precedent.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Adequate treatment of halved/doubled horizons.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Identifies blind spot of Labour tactical consolidation.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Assigns Green Party 40% win probability despite acknowledging "no poll shows Greens leading." This is heavily bookmaker-driven reasoning that overweights thin betting markets.
- Reform at 23% contradicts 2/3 MRP polls showing Reform leading. The reasoning for downweighting Reform (tactical squeeze, Caerphilly precedent) has some merit but goes too far.
- Same extraction format issue as S2-1: `**Probabilities**: [35, 23, 40, 2]`.

- **Score:** 10/16 (reasoning quality: overweights bookmakers, underweights polling), but **extraction failure nullifies contribution**

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses a structured approach with strong/moderate/weak tiers. Good integration of MRP evidence, tactical voting signals, and Reform momentum.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Lab 47/Ref 41/Grn 11/Oth 1 -> Output: Lab 42/Ref 45/Grn 12/Oth 1. Delta: Lab -5, Ref +4, Grn +1, Oth 0. Modest, evidence-supported shifts.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Provides halved/doubled horizon analysis with specific adjustments. Notes late tactical voting shifts and turnout operations.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed thoroughly. Identifies blind spot of late "Stop Reform" coordination. Notes turnout/voter ID differential as potential unmodeled factor.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Updates preserve sum = 100%.
- Reform as slight favorite (45%) is supported by 2/3 MRP polls showing Reform ahead.
- Green at 12% seems reasonable given no polling support for Green lead.
- Clear reasoning for each directional shift.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear three-tier framework. Identifies MRPs + bookmaker odds as key adjustment drivers. Good treatment of tactical voting signals (Cable, WPB absence) as partially offsetting.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Lab 58/Ref 30/Grn 10/Oth 2 -> Output: Lab 45/Ref 35/Grn 18/Oth 2. Delta: Lab -13, Ref +5, Grn +8, Oth 0. A substantial but well-justified shift from a Labour-bullish outside view.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but adequate. Notes +3 Lab if halved, -4 Lab if doubled.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed in abbreviated form. Identifies blind spot of late "Stop Reform" push coalescing around Greens.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Updates preserve sum = 100%.
- Labour at 45% as single most likely but with 55% non-Labour collectively aligns well with the mixed evidence.
- Grn at 18% balances bookmaker signal against lack of polling support.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Most granular analysis of all five. Breaks adjustments into numbered steps with specific pp shifts. Identifies 5 adjustment factors and traces each through.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: Lab 48/Ref 21/Grn 18/Oth 13 -> Output: Lab 38/Ref 31/Grn 25/Oth 6. Delta: Lab -10, Ref +10, Grn +7, Oth -7. Correctly reallocates the inflated "Other" from outside view while updating main contenders.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Adequate. Notes MRPs show Reform edging Labour by ~4pp on average.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Identifies blind spot of a high-profile Green endorsement (e.g., Corbyn touring for Greens).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Updates preserve sum = 100%.
- Correctly reduces "Other" from 13% to 6% (still high but directionally right).
- Reform at 31% may understate given MRP data; Green at 25% is the highest successful forecaster and may be too high without polling support.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input (Lab) | Final (Lab/Ref/Grn/Oth) | Delta Lab | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 47% | FAILED (38/42/20/0) | -9 | 13/16 | Yes (but lost to extraction) |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 60% | FAILED (35/23/40/2) | -25 | 10/16 | Partial (overweights bookmakers) |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 47% | 42/45/12/1 | -5 | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 58% | 45/35/18/2 | -13 | 13/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 48% | 38/31/25/6 | -10 | 12/16 | Partial (Other still high) |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4 from o3):** Received the most Labour-bullish outside view (60%) but made the most dramatic departure, shifting to Green-favorite (40%). This shows strong engagement with cross-pollinated input - rather than rubber-stamping the o3 outside view, the Sonnet instance applied current evidence aggressively. However, this extreme adjustment (25pp Labour drop) arguably overcorrects. Unfortunately, extraction failure means this diversity was lost.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2 from Sonnet 4.5):** Received a moderate Sonnet outside view (Lab 47/Ref 41) and made small, evidence-supported adjustments (Lab -5, Ref +4). Good engagement that refined rather than overhauled the input.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3 from GPT-5.2):** Received a Lab-bullish GPT-5.2 outside view (Lab 58/Ref 30) and made a substantial but measured correction (Lab -13, Ref +5, Grn +8). This is effective cross-pollination - the o3 model brought in MRP evidence and bookmaker data to moderate the GPT-5.2's conservatism.

- **S2-1 and S2-5 (self-model pairs):** Both received their own model's outside view. S2-1 made moderate adjustments; S2-5 primarily corrected its own inflated "Other" category. Self-model instances behaved less dramatically than cross-model instances.

- **Overall:** Cross-pollination would have been effective if extraction had succeeded. The cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) showed meaningful engagement with alternative views. However, the loss of both Sonnet 4.5 instances severely impacted diversity, leaving the ensemble with only GPT-5.2 and two o3 instances.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (party of the winning candidate in FPTP by-election).
- All correctly identified the forecast timeframe (20 days to Feb 26, 2026).
- All correctly assessed the current political landscape (Labour defending traditionally safe seat under extreme national unpopularity).

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. 2024 result: Labour 50.8%, Reform 14.1%, Green 13.2%, Workers Party 10.3%
2. Workers Party withdrawal benefits Greens; 11 confirmed candidates
3. National Labour polling below 20%, Starmer historically unpopular
4. Runcorn & Helsby 2025 precedent (Reform overturned 14,000+ Labour majority)
5. Constituency split between diverse Manchester wards and white working-class Tameside wards

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-5 / S2-5 | Inflated "Other" probability | Assigned 13% then 6% to "Other" (Conservatives + minor parties) despite all polling below 5% combined | Medium - compressed main contender probabilities |
| S2-2 | Overweights bookmaker odds | Assigned Greens 40% based heavily on 6/4 bookmaker odds (thin market, early January prices) while acknowledging no poll shows Greens leading | Medium - inconsistent reasoning |

### Hallucinations

No fabricated facts, dates, events, or sources were detected. All cited statistics (2024 results, MRP projections, candidate names) match across sources. The "leaked canvass returns" mentioned in the agent report (1-in-5 Denton voters mention Burnham veto) cannot be independently verified but is appropriately caveated.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. Excellent research quality - comprehensive coverage of a complex three-way election with no constituency polling, surfacing diverse sources including academic analysis, polling models, and campaign reporting.
2. Strong analytical framework across forecasters - all five demonstrated rigorous source analysis, reference class identification, and structured reasoning.
3. Good use of historical precedents (Copeland, Hartlepool, Runcorn, Caerphilly) to calibrate base rates for this unusual contest.

### Weaknesses
1. Critical extraction failure for 2 of 5 forecasters (both Sonnet 4.5 instances), reducing ensemble from 5 to 3 members and eliminating all Sonnet 4.5 contributions from the final aggregation.
2. Wide divergence in how forecasters weighted bookmaker odds vs MRP polling, leading to inconsistent Green Party probability estimates (12% to 40% across inside views).
3. The surviving 3-forecaster ensemble lacks model diversity - only GPT-5.2 and o3 contributed, eliminating the Sonnet 4.5 perspective that would have moderated the ensemble.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: C+**

The research and analytical reasoning are B+ quality, but the critical extraction failure (losing 40% of the ensemble) is a significant infrastructure problem that meaningfully degrades the forecast. The final 3-forecaster average (Lab 41.7%, Ref 37.0%, Grn 18.3%) is reasonable but less reliable than a full 5-forecaster ensemble would produce. The lost Sonnet 4.5 forecasts would have pulled the average modestly toward Reform (S2-1) and dramatically toward Greens (S2-2), likely producing a different final distribution.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- No major gaps identified. Research was comprehensive for a question with no constituency polling.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Fix extraction format for multiple choice:** The extractor failed on `**Probabilities:** [38, 42, 20, 0]` format. The extractor should support bracket-list format in addition to per-option format, especially for multiple choice questions.
- **Validate extraction success before aggregation:** Log warnings when forecasters fail extraction so operators can investigate and potentially re-run.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Both instances used a `**Probabilities:** [x, y, z, w]` format instead of the per-option format expected by the extractor. This is a consistent pattern suggesting a prompt-format compliance issue with this model on multiple choice questions. Consider adding explicit format examples to the prompt or adding extraction support for this format.
- **o3 (S1-5/S2-5):** Tendency to over-allocate to "Other" category. The 13% outside view for Other was poorly calibrated against all available evidence. Consider adding a prompt instruction to justify probabilities above 5% for non-leading options.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (MC) | Yes | Green ranged 12-25% across successful forecasters; Reform 31-45% |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates moved Lab down, which matched evidence direction |
| Factual errors present | No | Minor calibration issues but no factual errors |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Would have been effective but 2/5 lost to extraction failure |
| Critical info missed in research | No | |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | S2-5 Green at 25% is an outlier vs S2-3 (12%) and S2-4 (18%) |

## Post-Resolution Analysis (Complete After Resolution)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Actual Outcome | **Green Party** |
| Final Prediction | Lab 41.7% / Ref 37.0% / Grn 18.3% / Oth 3.0% |
| Peer Score | -22.9 |

### Retrospective

**Why the ensemble was off:** The ensemble put Labour first (41.7%), Reform second (37.0%), and Green third (18.3%). The actual winner was the **Green Party**. So we were wrong on both the winner and the rank order: we overestimated Labour and Reform and severely underestimated Green. Top-performing bots (manticAI, twsummerbot, and others) had Green as favorite or co-favorite (roughly 40–55% Green, 33–40% Reform, 8–20% Labour). We had access to much of the same evidence but weighted it differently and lost the one in-ensemble view that was most aligned with the market (and with the outcome).

**Evidence we overweighted**

- **Labour resilience and base rates.** Our outside view was heavily Labour-centric (Labour 47–60% across the five forecasters). We anchored on “safe seat” and “mid-term governing-party by-election hold rates” (e.g. 45% hold, 87% in safe seats) and did not sufficiently update when the best available near-term signal—betting markets—had Labour in single digits. We treated Labour’s 2024 majority and local organisation as a strong floor; top bots treated the same facts as a prior that had already been superseded by campaign and market signals with ~3 weeks to go.
- **MRP and the single constituency poll as “Reform vs Labour.”** We had 2/3 MRP projections showing Reform leading and the Find Out Now poll (Reform 30%, Labour 27%, Green 17%). We used that to support a Labour–Reform race with Green as a distant third. Top bots had the same MRP/poll but stressed that (a) the poll was tiny and high-uncertainty and (b) betting markets aggregate “soft” information (canvass returns, tactical expectations) that the poll does not capture. They weighted the **market** (Green favorite, Labour third) above the single noisy poll snapshot.
- **Prior over updating.** Our most Labour-bullish outside views (S1-3, S1-4: Labour 58–60%) stayed relatively high after inside-view updates (Labour 45%, 42%). The ensemble never fully incorporated the shift to “Green vs Reform, Labour squeezed” that the market and later campaign narrative reflected.

**Evidence we underweighted or missed**

- **Betting markets as the main aggregator.** Top bots explicitly converted Betfair Exchange (and/or bookmaker) odds into baseline probabilities (e.g. Green ~54–57%, Reform ~33–36%, Labour ~9–11%) and weighted that heavily (e.g. 55–90% weight) because the event was close and markets aggregate many small pieces of information. We had the same bookmaker data (Greens favorites, 6/4 or similar) but our forecasters either downweighted it as “thin” or “early” or confined large market-driven updates to S2-2 (Green 40%), which **failed extraction**. So the market signal never made it into the aggregate. We underweighted the market relative to MRP and our Labour-heavy prior.
- **Green’s pathway as winner, not just “squeeze beneficiary.”** We cited Caerphilly (Labour squeezed to third), Workers Party withdrawal, and Greens benefiting from redistribution—but we kept Green at 12–25% (18.3% aggregate). We did not treat “Green consolidates anti-Reform vote + Muslim vote + Gaza/local endorsements” as a plausible **winning** coalition. Top bots framed the race explicitly as “can the Greens consolidate enough protest votes to overtake Labour?” and “Green vs Reform two-horse race with Labour third,” and priced Green accordingly (40%+).
- **Loss of the Green-friendly in-ensemble view.** S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5), which received the most Labour-bullish outside view (60%), updated to **Green 40%**, Labour 35%, Reform 23%—i.e. Green as favorite, largely on bookmaker odds and tactical squeeze. That output failed extraction, so the only forecaster who would have put Green first was dropped. The surviving three forecasters (S2-3, S2-4, S2-5) had Green at 12%, 18%, and 25%; the aggregate was 18.3%. So we both underweighted the market in our reasoning and lost the one successful reasoning chain that had incorporated it strongly.

**Takeaways:** (1) For short-horizon, campaign-heavy events with thin polling, treat betting markets as a primary input (with explicit probability conversion and weight), not a secondary check. (2) When reference-class base rates (e.g. “Labour holds safe seats”) conflict with strong near-term aggregators (markets, campaign narrative), specify how much weight each gets and allow the aggregator to override the prior when the horizon is short. (3) Fix multiple-choice extraction so bracket-list formats are accepted; losing S2-1 and S2-2 removed the most market-aligned views from the ensemble and biased the aggregate toward Labour/Reform and away from Green.
