# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster 2 median 5pp below ensemble center | High | S2-2 | Forecaster 2 (Sonnet 4.5) produced a median of ~41%, roughly 4-5pp below the other four forecasters (~44-47%), driven by heavy weight on COVID removal and optimistic interpretation of PLM reform effects. |
| Pipeline error blocked supervisor in production | Medium | Step 7 / metadata.json | `compute_divergence()` was called with incorrect keyword argument `predictions` instead of `agent_results`, preventing the supervisor from running during the live pipeline. |
| No national turnout polling surfaced | Medium | Research | Neither Google, Google News, AskNews, nor agentic search found any specific 2026 national turnout polls or projections from IFOP/CEVIPOF/OpinionWay, limiting the ability to anchor forecasts. |
| Outside view prompt provided weak source mix | Low | Research | Several question URL scrapes and search results returned Paris-specific, local commune, or procedural articles with no national abstention data, diluting the useful signal. |

- **Question Type:** numeric
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-02-14
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-03-18
- **Forecast Window:** 29 days (Feb 14 → Mar 15 election)
- **Final Prediction (weighted avg):** Median ~44.5%, P10 ~37.4%, P90 ~53.6%
- **Step 2 Predictions (medians):** S2-1: ~46%, S2-2: ~41%, S2-3: ~44.3%, S2-4: ~46%, S2-5: ~45.5%
- **Spread:** P10 range 35-40; P90 range 49-56 across forecasters

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes |
| FRED | No | No | No (not applicable) |
| yFinance | No | No | No (not applicable) |
| Google Trends | No | No | No (not applicable) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. `abstention premier tour municipales 2020 2014` (Google)
2. `abstention municipales 2026 sondage` (Google News)
3. `Provide national abstention rates for the first round of every French municipal election from 1977-2020 according to the Interior Ministry, and summarize any polling or expert projections about first-round turnout/abstention in the 2026 municipal elections...` (Agent)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. `sondage abstention municipales 2026` (Google)
2. `abstention 2026 municipales premier tour` (Google News)
3. `Provide the most recent February 2026 French polling or expert estimates of voter turnout/abstention for the first round of the March 15 2026 municipal elections` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 1977-2020 abstention series, structural trends | Feb 2026 polls, expert commentary, reform analysis |
| Content type | Interior Ministry figures, academic analysis, Fondapol data | AskNews articles, local press, IFOP/CEVIPOF expert quotes |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Complete 1977-2020 time series, COVID decomposition (39% virus-specific), Bréchon academic analysis | Local campaign dynamics, Destin Commun survey (60% intend to vote), IFOP expert commentary (Dabi, Kraus) |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries correctly targeted the base rate time series, and the Agent produced a comprehensive 1977-2020 compilation with expert ranges.
- Current queries surfaced good local color (Marseille, Maine-et-Loire) and the Destin Commun survey, but **no national turnout poll** was found. This is the key information gap — and it's likely because no such poll exists yet rather than a query failure.
- French-language queries were appropriate for this question (most relevant sources are in French).
- Question URL scraping pulled Fondapol and INSEE pages, providing the authoritative historical series.
- **Critical gap:** No query targeted the specific impact of the new proportional list system on small-commune turnout, which turned out to be a key disagreement driver.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs are primarily factual (Interior Ministry figures, historical series). The Agent report includes expert opinion ranges (40-50%) from academics and Interior Ministry working notes, but these are properly attributed. The AskNews articles include expert commentary (Dabi on "double scenario," Kerrouche on the "paradox") but avoid specific probability estimates. The Destin Commun survey (60% intend to vote) is the closest thing to a forward-looking quantitative input. Research appropriately remains informational.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** Complete first-round abstention series 1977-2020, 2020 COVID decomposition (39% virus-driven), expert ranges (Interior Ministry 40-43%, CEVIPOF 46-49%), new electoral system details (proportional list for all communes, PLM reform), urban-rural abstention gap (IFOP/Kraus), Destin Commun survey (60% intend to vote), local examples (Marseille 67%, Loire-Atlantique >60%).
- **Critical information missed:** No specific national turnout polling for 2026 (likely doesn't exist yet); no comparative evidence from other countries that switched to proportional lists; no weather forecast for March 15 (relevant for turnout); no analysis of how 2022/2024 national election abstention rates map to municipal election expectations.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Good. Surfaced Fondapol historical data, Le Monde, The Conversation academic analysis, CNEWS factual recap. French-language queries effective.
  - Agent report: Good. Compiled the 1977-2020 series and forward-looking expert ranges coherently.
  - AskNews articles: Moderate. 16+ articles but many were local/procedural with limited national relevance. Best contributions: IFOP expert commentary and Destin Commun survey.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough. Correctly identified Fondapol, Bréchon/The Conversation, and Le Monde Décodeurs as the most useful sources. Appropriately flagged Le Monde Paris article and CEVIPOF project note as low-relevance.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Used historical first-round abstention 1959-2014 as primary reference class. Identified the 2020 COVID spike as an outlier. Good decomposition of structural vs. COVID-specific factors.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 30-day window to election. Good sensitivity analysis (halved/doubled).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Centered on trend extrapolation (38.7% in 2014 + structural increase) with Interior Ministry and CEVIPOF ranges as anchors. Clear.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate P50 ~45% derived from trend + structural adjustment.
- 10th-90th range of 39.5-51% is appropriate width for a question with no polling data.
- Slight right-skew justified by structural disaffection risk.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Nearly identical to S1-1 (same model, same prompt). Correctly prioritized sources.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Used same historical baseline but weighed COVID removal more heavily. Novel analysis: explicitly estimated the COVID-specific component (~6pp) and subtracted it.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly noted municipal elections show little late-campaign volatility.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Lower central estimate (~41-42% median) driven by stronger weight on COVID removal and new PLM system potentially increasing urban engagement.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P50 ~41% is the most optimistic of all forecasters.
- 10th-90th of 37-49% has a tighter right tail than others.
- The reasoning is internally consistent but may underweight structural disaffection evidence.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Well-organized with source-by-source evaluation. Correctly identified Fondapol and The Conversation as key.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidate classes considered: all post-decentralization (1977-2014), post-1990 modern era, and all nationwide local elections. Chose the most appropriate hybrid. Strongest structural trend analysis of all five.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Notes 30-day window allows for campaign dynamics but unlikely fundamental shifts.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Outside view center at ~43%, then adjusted with inside-view factors. Distribution notably wider than S1-1 and S1-2 at the tails (P10: 38, P90: 52).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P50 ~44.3% sits in the middle of the ensemble.
- Distribution shape (mildly right-skewed, wider tails) is well-calibrated for the uncertainty level.
- Best treatment of the electoral reform question.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and effective. Correctly treated the Agent report's expert ranges as opinion, not fact.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Four candidate classes including post-1977, post-1990, and all nationwide local elections. Best quantitative reference class analysis — explicitly computed sigma from the historical series.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Notes 30-day window is standard for municipal campaigns.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Centered at ~44% with explicit component adjustments: +1pp structural rise, +1pp parity/list rules, -1pp no COVID. Net ~45% central.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P50 ~45-46% with very wide 10th-90th (37-56%).
- The P90 of 56% is notably aggressive — would exceed even the COVID-era rate.
- Good fat-tail reasoning but may overweight extreme scenarios.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient and accurate. Correctly prioritized Interior Ministry data over local anecdotes.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidates. Good use of long-run upward trend (+17pp over 43 years). Realistic assessment of structural persistence.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Concise but adequate. 31-day window, halved/doubled sensitivity.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Net shift +1.3pp from outside view center. Central estimate ~45.5-46%. Component breakdown clear (structural +1.5, reform +0.5, no COVID -1.0).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P50 ~46% with wide range (35-54%).
- The P10 of 35% is the most optimistic lower tail — would require unprecedented remobilization.
- Distribution shape appropriate with fat tails.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (P50) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~45% | 13/16 | Clear trend + expert range anchoring | No quantitative reference class |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~41% | 12/16 | Explicit COVID decomposition | May overweight COVID removal |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~44% | 14/16 | Best structural trend analysis, widest exploration of reference classes | Wide tails may reflect excess uncertainty |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~45.5% | 13/16 | Best quantitative reference class (computed sigma) | P90 of 56% seems excessive |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~46% | 13/16 | Clear component-based adjustment framework | P10 of 35% seems too optimistic |

---

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (P50) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | ~45% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~45.5% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~41% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ~44% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | ~46% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent structured Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly identified the Interior Ministry and CEVIPOF expert ranges as strong evidence. AskNews articles (IFOP Dabi, Kraus urban analysis, Destin Commun) appropriately weighted as moderate.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~45% → Output: ~46%, Δ = +1pp). Modest upward shift justified by confirmation of structural disaffection and alignment with CEVIPOF's upper range. Appropriate conservatism.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis. Halved: tighten by 1pp. Doubled: widen by 2pp.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot: major political event in final 2 weeks. Status quo assessment reasonable.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate and range well-calibrated.
- P10-P90 of 40-52% appropriately tightened from outside view.
- Distribution shape consistent with stated reasoning.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structured analysis. Correctly identified same strong evidence pieces. Moderate evidence includes Destin Commun 60% intent to vote, urban-rural dynamics.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~45.5% → Output: ~41%, Δ = -4.5pp). **Very large downward shift** from the cross-pollinated o3 outside view. Driven by heavy weighting of COVID removal and new PLM system potentially increasing urban engagement. This is the same analytical pattern as S1-2 — Sonnet 4.5 appears to have a systematic tendency toward the optimistic end.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot: major shock.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P50 of ~41% is the clear outlier in the ensemble.
- P10 of 37% implies near-2014 levels — requires very strong remobilization.
- P90 of 49% is the lowest upper tail, suggesting insufficient right-tail risk acknowledgment.
- The cross-pollinated o3 input (~45.5%) was largely overridden by this forecaster's own prior.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework. Correctly used Strong/Moderate/Weak tiers. Interesting that it received the optimistic S1-2 (~41%) input and adjusted *upward*.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~41% → Output: ~44.3%, Δ = +3.3pp). Moved away from S1-2's optimistic position toward the ensemble center. This is excellent cross-pollination behavior — GPT-5.2 engaged with the input but corrected what it judged to be an over-optimistic assessment.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good halved/doubled analysis.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot: "municipalization" of politics driving unexpected turnout.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P50 of ~44.3% is well-centered in the ensemble.
- Distribution wider than S2-2, narrower than S2-4. Good.
- The upward correction from the cross-pollinated input is the strongest positive signal of cross-pollination effectiveness in this forecast.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured. Three evidence tiers. Correctly identified structural disaffection and reform effects as key drivers.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~44% → Output: ~46%, Δ = +2pp). Modest upward shift with widened right tail (P90 56%). The four scenarios (rapid control, plateau, continued disaffection, crisis) are borrowed from epidemiological forecasting but map reasonably to election dynamics.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot: terrorist attack or major security event.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P50 of ~46% is at the higher end of the ensemble.
- P90 of 56% remains very aggressive — would exceed 2020 COVID levels. Insufficiently justified.
- Overall distribution shape reasonable but with excessively fat right tail.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but effective. Correctly weighted structural factors and reform effects.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~46% → Output: ~45.5%, Δ = -0.5pp). Essentially held position, which is reasonable for a self-model pair.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot: late crisis.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- P50 of ~45.5% with 10th-90th of 35-54%.
- The P10 of 35% remains too optimistic (below any post-2000 French election).
- Wide distribution reflects genuine uncertainty about the new electoral system's impact.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input (P50) | Final (P50) | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~45% | ~46% | +1 | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~45.5% | ~41% | -4.5 | 11/16 | Partial — overrides cross-pollinated input |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~41% | ~44.3% | +3.3 | 14/16 | Yes — excellent correction from optimistic input |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~44% | ~46% | +2 | 12/16 | Yes — but P90 excessive |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~46% | ~45.5% | -0.5 | 12/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 ← S1-4/o3):** Poor engagement. Received o3's ~45.5% median and revised dramatically *downward* to ~41%, essentially ignoring the cross-pollinated input in favor of its own prior. This Sonnet 4.5 instance appears to have a strong systematic preference for the optimistic COVID-removal narrative regardless of input.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← S1-2/Sonnet 4.5):** Excellent engagement. Received Sonnet's optimistic ~41% and revised *upward* to ~44.3%, demonstrating genuine analytical independence. This is the best cross-pollination outcome — GPT-5.2 engaged with the reasoning, identified the over-optimism, and corrected.

- **S2-4 (o3 ← S1-3/GPT-5.2):** Good engagement. Received GPT-5.2's central ~44% and shifted modestly upward to ~46% based on structural factors. Maintained broad agreement while adding scenario diversity.

- **S2-1 and S2-5 (self-model pairs):** Both made very modest adjustments (±0.5-1pp) from their own outside views, which is expected and appropriate.

- **Net effect on diversity:** Cross-pollination moderately improved ensemble quality. The critical success was S2-3's correction of S1-2's optimistic input, preventing GPT-5.2 from inheriting an outlier position. The critical failure was S2-2 ignoring its cross-pollinated input entirely.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: national abstention rate per Interior Ministry for the first round on March 15, 2026.
- All correctly identified the 29-31 day forecast window.
- All correctly anchored on the 2014 baseline (36.45-38.7%), 2020 anomaly (55.3%), and long-run trend.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. 2020 first-round abstention: 55.3% (Interior Ministry)
2. 2014 first-round abstention: ~36.45-38.7%
3. Long-run upward trend from ~27% (1989) to ~39% (2014)
4. COVID accounted for ~39% of 2020 abstentionists (IFOP/Ipsos surveys)
5. New uniform proportional list system for all communes (eliminating panachage in <1,000 pop.)
6. PLM reform (Paris/Lyon/Marseille city-wide councils)
7. Expert consensus range: 40-50% for 2026

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-2 | Directional misinterpretation of PLM reform | Forecaster 2 assumed PLM reform would *increase* urban engagement, while most experts suggest it may *reduce* small-commune personalization. | Medium |
| S2-4 | P90 of 56% exceeds 2020 COVID level | Placed 10% probability on exceeding the pandemic-era abstention without a comparable shock. | Low (tail only) |
| S2-5 | P10 of 35% below any post-2000 election | Would require abstention lower than any French election since 1995. | Low (tail only) |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinated facts, dates, events, or sources detected. All factual claims trace to the research artifacts. The "Interior Ministry working note" projecting 40-43% was referenced by the Agent report and used by multiple forecasters — this could not be independently verified but is plausibly sourced.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Good query design for a French-language question.** Queries were appropriately in French, targeting Interior Ministry data, polling institutes, and academic sources. The Agent query for the 1977-2020 series was well-constructed.
2. **Consistent factual grounding.** All five forecasters correctly identified the key historical data points and structural factors, with no hallucinations.
3. **Strong GPT-5.2 cross-pollination.** Forecaster 3's correction of the optimistic S1-2 input is a textbook example of effective cross-pollination, improving ensemble quality.
4. **Appropriate uncertainty calibration.** With no national polling data available, the 10th-90th spreads (generally 12-18pp) appropriately reflect genuine uncertainty about a question with strong structural priors but limited current data.

### Weaknesses
1. **Forecaster 2's systematic optimism.** Both S1-2 and S2-2 produced the ensemble's lowest estimates (~41%), driven by the same COVID-removal argument. In S2-2, the cross-pollinated o3 input (~45.5%) was essentially ignored, defeating the purpose of cross-pollination.
2. **No differentiated evidence between forecasters.** All five relied on the same ~8 factual inputs (2020 rate, 2014 rate, trend, COVID decomposition, Destin Commun survey, PLM reform, expert ranges). Without more diverse evidence, disagreements reduce to pure judgment differences about weighting.
3. **Extreme tails insufficiently disciplined.** Forecaster 4's P90 of 56% and Forecaster 5's P10 of 35% are both historically unprecedented scenarios that received insufficient justification.
4. **Pipeline error.** The `compute_divergence()` bug prevented the supervisor from running during the live pipeline, which would have added value on this question given the meaningful disagreement about the central estimate.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

The research pipeline surfaced all available evidence effectively, and four of five forecasters produced well-reasoned, appropriately calibrated distributions. Forecaster 2's systematic optimism and resistance to cross-pollination is the main weakness. The final aggregated distribution (median ~44.5%) is reasonable given the evidence, though it's pulled slightly low by Forecaster 2. The pipeline bug preventing the supervisor from running is a noted infrastructure issue.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add a query targeting comparative evidence from countries that switched local election systems to proportional lists (e.g., Norway, Denmark municipal reforms) to help resolve the electoral reform disagreement.
- Consider adding a weather forecast query for election day (March 15), which historically affects French municipal turnout by 1-3pp.
- Add a query for 2022 and 2024 French legislative election abstention rates as additional structural anchors.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- For questions where all forecasters have identical evidence inputs, consider whether the inside-view prompt could explicitly ask forecasters to identify what evidence would *change* their estimate, to surface genuine disagreement drivers.
- The `compute_divergence()` bug (wrong keyword argument) should be fixed to enable the supervisor in future runs.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Instance 2 showed a systematic pattern of ignoring cross-pollinated inputs when they conflicted with its prior. This was the same model in both S1-2 and S2-2, suggesting a structural tendency toward the optimistic interpretation for French election questions. Monitor for similar patterns.
- **GPT-5.2:** Strong performance. Best cross-pollination engagement, well-centered final estimate. No specific concerns.
- **o3:** Both instances produced reasonable central estimates but with excessively wide tails (P10 35/37 and P90 54/56). Consider whether the forecasting prompt could more explicitly ask for tail justification relative to historical bounds.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (numeric) | No | Median range 41-46% across forecasters; question range 25-55, spread is 5pp = 17% of range |
| Update direction errors | Partial | S2-2 revised downward from S1-4's 45.5% to 41% — defensible but against the weight of evidence |
| Factual errors present | No | |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | S2-3 excellent, S2-2 poor, others neutral |
| Critical info missed in research | No | Absence of national polls is a real-world gap, not a research failure |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All calculations internally consistent |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5, P50 ~41%) is ~1.5 SD below ensemble mean of ~44.5% |

---

## 9. Supervisor Performance Assessment

### Context

The supervisor was run post-hoc on this question's artifacts via `scripts/resume_supervisor.py`. The production pipeline failed to run the supervisor due to a `compute_divergence()` bug (calling with `predictions=` instead of `agent_results=`). The supervisor was executed using Claude Opus 4.6 at a cost of $0.14.

### Supervisor Input

The supervisor received all five forecasters' percentiles and reasoning:

| Forecaster | P10 | P20 | P40 | P60 | P80 | P90 | Implied P50 |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------------|
| 1 (Sonnet 4.5) | 40 | 42 | 45 | 47 | 49 | 52 | ~46% |
| 2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 37 | 39 | 40.5 | 42 | 45 | 49 | ~41% |
| 3 (GPT-5.2) | 38 | 40.5 | 43 | 45.5 | 48.5 | 52 | ~44.3% |
| 4 (o3) | 37 | 39 | 43 | 46 | 50 | 56 | ~44.5% |
| 5 (o3) | 35 | 39 | 44 | 47 | 51 | 54 | ~45.5% |

### Disagreement Analysis Quality

The supervisor identified three clear disagreements:

1. **Central estimate gap (Forecaster 2 at ~41% vs. others at ~45-46%)** — Correctly identified as the most impactful, representing a 4-5pp gap. Root cause: different weighting of COVID removal vs. structural disaffection. The supervisor correctly noted this is partially resolvable through polling data.

2. **Right tail risk (P90 range: 49-56%)** — Correctly identified Forecaster 4's P90 of 56% as an outlier. Root cause: different subjective assessments of tail event probability (terrorism, political crisis). The supervisor appropriately noted this is largely judgment-based.

3. **Electoral reform direction** — Correctly identified the factual disagreement about whether the uniform proportional list helps or hurts turnout. Forecaster 2 argued it increases urban engagement; others argued it reduces small-commune personalization. The supervisor correctly flagged this as empirically resolvable.

**Assessment:** The disagreement analysis is precise and well-structured. All three disagreements are real, correctly attributed, and ranked by impact. The root cause analysis correctly distinguishes factual vs. judgment-based disagreements.

### Research Quality

The supervisor generated four search queries:
1. `sondage abstention municipales 2026 France` (Google News) — Appropriate
2. `municipales 2026 participation intention vote sondage` (Google) — Appropriate
3. Agent query about IFOP/CEVIPOF projections and proportional list impact — Well-targeted
4. `scrutin liste proportionnel communes effet participation électorale` (Google) — Good, directly targeting Disagreement 3

**Findings:**
- **No national turnout polls found** — consistent with the ensemble's research, confirming this is a real information gap rather than a query failure.
- **Youth abstention data surfaced** (72% among 18-34 in 2020) — new information not in the original research that supports the higher-abstention camp.
- **Polish PR study** (3-4pp turnout increase from proportional representation) — useful comparative evidence, though the supervisor correctly noted it's in a different context.
- **AMF article on proportional list reform** — confirmed that panachage removal in small communes reduces personalized candidate selection, supporting the majority view that it increases abstention.
- **Huffington Post polling map** — no national turnout data but confirmed 38-42% pre-COVID benchmark.

**Assessment:** The research was well-targeted at resolving the identified disagreements. It partially resolved Disagreement 3 (electoral reform direction) in favor of the majority. It did not resolve Disagreement 1 (central estimate) due to absence of polling data, which the supervisor correctly acknowledged. Research quality is good.

### Updated Forecast Quality

**Supervisor's prediction:**

| Percentile | Supervisor | Weighted Avg (ensemble) | Delta |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| P10 | 37.5 | ~37.4 | +0.1 |
| P20 | 40.0 | ~39.7 | +0.3 |
| P40 | 43.5 | ~43.1 | +0.4 |
| P60 | 46.0 | ~45.5 | +0.5 |
| P80 | 49.5 | ~48.7 | +0.8 |
| P90 | 53.0 | ~52.6 | +0.4 |

**Key adjustments and their justification:**

1. **Modest upward shift across all percentiles (+0.1 to +0.8pp):** The supervisor correctly identified that the weight of evidence favors the higher-abstention camp (Forecasters 1, 3, 4, 5) over Forecaster 2's lower estimate. The upward shift reduces Forecaster 2's downward pull on the aggregate. This is well-justified.

2. **Trimmed Forecaster 4's extreme P90 (56% → 53%):** The supervisor concluded that the P90 of 56% "seems excessive given no pandemic-like event is on the horizon." This is correct — the 53% P90 is still fat-tailed (above 2014 by 15pp) but doesn't exceed the COVID-era level.

3. **Preserved lower tail (P10 37.5% essentially unchanged):** The supervisor didn't push the lower tail up, appropriately preserving the possibility of strong mobilization.

4. **Confidence: MEDIUM** — Appropriate given that the central disagreement (Forecaster 2 vs. others) could not be definitively resolved through research.

**Assessment:** The supervisor's prediction is a well-calibrated improvement over the weighted average. The adjustments are modest, directionally correct, and well-justified by the research findings. The supervisor correctly avoided overconfident overrides when the evidence was inconclusive on the central question, while making targeted corrections where evidence did support a conclusion (electoral reform direction, right-tail trimming).

### Supervisor Summary

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Disagreement identification | Strong | Correctly identified all three key disagreements with proper attribution and impact ranking |
| Research targeting | Strong | Queries directly addressed identified disagreements; correctly acknowledged when information was unavailable |
| Evidence integration | Good | New evidence (youth abstention, AMF reform analysis) appropriately weighted; Polish PR study used cautiously |
| Forecast adjustment | Good | Modest, directionally correct adjustments; appropriate restraint given inconclusive central evidence |
| Confidence calibration | Good | MEDIUM confidence appropriate for the evidence situation |
| Cost efficiency | Strong | $0.14 for a meaningful improvement over the weighted average |

**Overall Supervisor Grade: B+**

The supervisor demonstrated its value proposition clearly on this question: it identified the key disagreement (Forecaster 2's outlier optimism), conducted targeted research, partially resolved the electoral reform question, and produced a modestly improved forecast. The primary limitation — inability to find national turnout polls — is a real-world information constraint, not a supervisor failure. On a question where the supervisor could find more decisive evidence (as it did on question 42049's measles data), the value-add would be even larger.
