# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster 3 (GPT-5.2) outside view truncated | High | S1-3 | GPT-5.2 outside view was truncated at 4000 tokens and produced no output (0 input/output tokens logged). No S1-3 file was saved. S2-4 (which should receive S1-3) received S1-4's (its own) outside view via cross-pollination fallback, preserving the chain but losing cross-model diversity (o3 received o3 instead of GPT-5.2). |
| S2-1 collapsed 90th percentile to 3.75 | Medium | S2-1 | Forecaster 1 set P60=P80=P90=3.75, eliminating the entire right tail. While reasoning was internally consistent, this violates the prompt instruction to set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals for unknown unknowns and implies literally 0% probability of any outcome above 3.75%. |
| Aggregated CDF percentiles diverge from individual forecasters | Medium | Aggregation | The final aggregated prediction shows P10=2.37 and P90=4.80, far wider than any individual forecaster (whose P10s ranged 3.25-3.50 and P90s ranged 3.75-4.05). This suggests the CDF construction from discrete-like percentile inputs is introducing smoothing artifacts. |
| o3 outside views assigned excessive upside tail weight | Medium | S1-4, S1-5 | Both o3 outside views placed P80=4.00 and P90=4.25, implying ~20% probability of a rate hike in an easing cycle where no Fed official has suggested hikes and Powell explicitly dismissed them. |
| AskNews deep research hit rate limit | Low | Research | AskNews deep research failed with 403 usage-limit error. Standard AskNews query returned 22 articles but many were irrelevant (Turkey, Brazil, Canada). |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## Summary

- **Question ID:** 42039
- **Question Title:** What will be the upper bound of the Federal Funds Target Range on March 31, 2026?
- **Question Type:** numeric
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-02-09
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-04-01
- **Forecast Window:** 51 days
- **Final Prediction:** Median 3.70, 10th pctile 2.37, 90th pctile 4.80
- **Step 2 Predictions (median [P10, P90]):**
  - S2-1: 3.75 [3.25, 3.75]
  - S2-2: 3.75 [3.50, 3.90]
  - S2-3: 3.75 [3.25, 4.00]
  - S2-4: 3.75 [3.35, 4.05]
  - S2-5: 3.75 [3.30, 4.05]
- **Spread:** All S2 medians at 3.75; P10 range 3.25-3.50 (0.25 pts); P90 range 3.75-4.05 (0.30 pts) -- tight consensus
- **Total Cost:** $0.80
- **Duration:** 296 seconds
- **One-sentence quality assessment:** Strong consensus correctly centered on 3.75% status quo with appropriate downside probability for a March cut, but partially compromised by a GPT-5.2 truncation (cross-pollination fallback preserved a valid starting point but lost cross-model diversity), one collapsed right tail, and an aggregated CDF that produces oddly wide final percentiles despite individually tight forecasts.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical, 2 steps) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (current; deep research failed 403) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | Yes (historical; returned DFEDTARU data) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | N/A (numeric question) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | No (no question URLs) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent, FRED):
1. `current federal funds target range 2026` (Google) -- 3 results
2. `Fed rate outlook March 2026` (Google News) -- 3 results
3. `Provide the history of the Federal Funds Target Range upper bound (DFEDTARU) from January 2022 to February 2026 and list every FOMC meeting date with the corresponding change. Summarize any guidance from the December 2025 and January 2026 policy statements on future moves.` (Agent) -- 2 steps, 1 report
4. `DFEDTARU` (FRED) -- 1 result with historical statistics and recent values

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. `March 2026 fed funds futures` (Google) -- 3 results
2. `March 2026 FOMC rate expectations` (Google News) -- 3 results
3. `What do analysts predict the Federal Reserve target range upper bound will be after the March 2026 FOMC meeting in the United States? Provide forecasts updated since January 2026.` (AskNews) -- 22 articles

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Jan 2022-Feb 2026 rate history, meeting-by-meeting changes, Dec/Jan guidance | March 2026 FOMC expectations, futures pricing, analyst forecasts |
| Content type | FRED data series, FOMC statement analysis, rate change history | Market probabilities, analyst forecasts, Fed official quotes |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent, FRED | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Complete meeting-by-meeting history, Dec/Jan guidance language, FRED statistics | CME FedWatch probabilities (80/20 hold/cut), J.P. Morgan forecast, Daly quote |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries targeted the complete rate history and official Fed guidance, while current queries targeted March 2026 market expectations.
- The Agent query was highly effective for this question type. It completed in only 2 steps (vs. the 7-step max), producing an excellent meeting-by-meeting table and synthesis of Dec 2025 and Jan 2026 guidance.
- FRED integration worked well, returning the current value (3.75%), historical statistics, and recent daily values.
- The historical Google query overlaps somewhat with the current stage, but delivered useful BlackRock and Goldman Sachs articles.
- Critical information surfaced: current rate 3.75%, Jan 2026 hold with 2 dissents, CME FedWatch 80/20 hold/cut probabilities, multiple Fed official quotes on neutral rate, next meeting date March 17-18.
- Critical gap: No direct CME FedWatch probability data (only secondhand from AskNews articles). The CME pages themselves returned only tool descriptions, not actual probabilities.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs were largely factual but appropriately included institutional forecasts as context:
- Goldman Sachs forecast cuts in March and June 2026 (terminal rate 3.00-3.25%) -- identifiable expert opinion, appropriate context.
- BlackRock forecast pause early 2026, then 1-2 cuts after new Fed Chair -- similarly appropriate.
- J.P. Morgan strategists forecast no cut until summer 2026 -- appropriate.
- Trading Economics forecast 3.75% by end Q1, 3.25% in 2027 -- unnamed analyst opinion.

The Agent report was appropriately factual, synthesizing official statements and votes without offering its own forecast. Overall, research informed without inappropriately forecasting.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current upper bound = 3.75% (FRED, confirmed by multiple sources)
  - January 28, 2026 FOMC: held at 3.75%, 2 dissents (Waller, Miran) favoring cuts
  - December 2025 meeting: 3rd consecutive cut, 9-3 vote, "close call" language
  - January statement upgraded growth to "solid," removed "downside risks to employment"
  - CME FedWatch: ~80% hold / ~20% cut for March (secondhand from news articles)
  - Multiple Fed officials' neutral rate estimates (range 2.6% to 3.9%, median 3.0%)
  - Next FOMC meeting: March 17-18, 2026
  - December dot plot: median projects only one 25bp cut in 2026
- **Critical information missed:**
  - Direct CME FedWatch probability data (CME pages returned only descriptions)
  - SOFR futures pricing for more granular probability extraction
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Strong. BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Investopedia, FRED all delivered high-quality data and expert analysis.
  - Agent report: Excellent. Completed in 2 steps with comprehensive meeting-by-meeting table and guidance synthesis. Best Agent performance assessed in this codebase.
  - AskNews articles: Mixed. One highly relevant article (Feb 9 with CME FedWatch data and Daly quote) but many irrelevant results (Turkey, Brazil, Canada inflation topics).
  - FRED data: Excellent. Returned current value, historical statistics, and recent daily values.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all 6 sources with quality ratings. Correctly identifies FRED as highest reliability, Agent report as excellent synthesis. Distinguishes factual data from expert opinions. Excellent handling of Investopedia quotes from named Fed officials. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 reference classes (Fed rate changes over 2-month periods during easing cycles, near-neutral data-dependent periods, post-dissent behavior). Selects "near-neutral with data-dependent stance" with strong justification citing Powell's language and recent statement changes. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 51-day horizon. Identifies March 18-19 meeting as only scheduled decision point. Provides historical patterns for pause, easing, and tightening periods. Notes January's hawkish shift raised the bar for March cuts. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear scenario-based derivation: base case 3.75% (~70%), secondary 3.50% (~20-25%), tail scenarios <5% each. Probability assignments well-justified. Minor weakness: mapping from probabilities to percentiles could be more quantitatively rigorous. 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- P10=3.25, P20=3.50 captures the cut scenario appropriately.
- P40-P90 concentrated at 3.75 reflects the ~70% hold probability.
- P90=4.00 provides a modest right tail for unknown unknowns.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Very thorough. Evaluates each source individually with quality tags. Correctly identifies FRED as primary authoritative source. Notes Kiplinger had limited content. Good separation of expert opinion from factual data. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 reference classes (Fed pause periods, final stages of easing, Fed behavior near neutral). Selects "near neutral with divided Committee" with strong justification and historical parallels. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 51 days with one meeting. Notes Fed never moved >50bps in a single easing meeting. Dot plot projects only one cut for 2026. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Explicit probability assignments: 70% hold, 25% cut to 3.50%, 3% cut to 3.25%, 2% increase to 4.00%. Well-justified. P10=3.50 is tighter than S1-1, reflecting higher hold confidence. 3/4

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** N/A -- outside view response was truncated at 4000 tokens. The tool_usage.json shows 0 input/output tokens with error "Response truncated after 4000 tokens (limit: 4000)." No output file was saved.
- **Reference Class Selection:** N/A
- **Timeframe Analysis:** N/A
- **Base Rate Derivation:** N/A

- **Score:** 0/16 (not produced)

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise coverage of all sources. Correctly dismisses Kiplinger. Good separation of facts vs. opinions. 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes: (i) any 51-day window, (ii) windows with exactly one FOMC meeting (~176 windows since 2003), (iii) second year of easing near neutral. Selects class (ii) with explicit sample sizes and base rates (35% action, 90% of moves +/-25bp). Excellent quantitative rigor. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 51 days and one meeting. Notes inter-meeting moves occurred only once in 20 years (COVID). 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derives explicit CDF: <=3.25% at 5%, 3.50% at 30%, 3.75% at 70%, 4.00% at 88%, 4.25% at 97%. Quantitatively rigorous. However, ~20% probability above 3.75% (hike territory) seems excessive given no official has suggested hikes. 3/4

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise evaluation. Appropriate weight given to FRED and Agent report. Good factual/opinion distinction. 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes including subset where rate was 3-4% and inflation above target but falling (20 windows). Selects with explicit base rates: 70% no change, 25% +/-25bp, 5% +/-50bp. Better contextual fit than S1-4. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 51 days. Notes inter-meeting moves 0/60 since 2009. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Explicit probability mass function with 6 discrete outcomes. Same pattern as S1-4: ~20% above 3.75%. Rightward skew excessive for easing cycle. 3/4

- **Score:** 14/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Median [P10, P90]) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|-------------------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 3.75 [3.25, 4.00] | 15/16 | Thorough source analysis, well-structured scenarios | Could be more quantitatively rigorous |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 3.75 [3.50, 4.00] | 15/16 | Tighter left tail, higher hold confidence | Very similar to S1-1, limited diversity |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | N/A (truncated) | 0/16 | N/A | Complete failure due to token truncation |
| S1-4 | o3 | 3.85 [3.25, 4.25] | 14/16 | Most quantitatively rigorous CDF construction | Excessive right tail weight (~20% above 3.75%) |
| S1-5 | o3 | 3.75 [3.25, 4.25] | 14/16 | Best reference class contextual fit | Same o3 right-tail pattern |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Prediction (Median [P10, P90]) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 3.75 [3.25, 4.00] |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 3.85 [3.25, 4.25] |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 3.75 [3.50, 4.00] |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-4 (self, fallback) | 3.85 [3.25, 4.25] |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 3.75 [3.25, 4.25] |

Note: S1-3 was truncated and produced no output. Cross-pollination fallback activated: S2-4 received S1-4's (its own) outside view instead, losing intended cross-model diversity (o3 ← GPT-5.2) but preserving a valid starting distribution.

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong: CME FedWatch 80.1% hold, J.P. Morgan no-cut-until-summer, January hold with hawkish upgrades. Moderate: Daly comments, dot plot, economic data. Weak: Powell term, unnamed forecasts. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 3.75 [3.25, 4.00] -> Output: 3.75 [3.25, 3.75]. Collapsed right tail from P90=4.00 to P90=3.75. Justified by "No credible path to 4.00%+ in 51 days." Direction correct but tail collapse implies 0% upside probability. 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. If halved: virtually certain 3.75%. If doubled: median shifts to 3.50%. 4/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 7 items completed. Consistency check present. Blind spot identified. Technicalities verified. 4/4

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework. Strong: J.P. Morgan, CME FedWatch, Powell's language. Moderate: dissents, Daly, dot plot. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 3.85 [3.25, 4.25] -> Output: 3.75 [3.50, 3.90]. Dramatic correction of S1-4 excessive upside. Shifted hold probability from ~45% to ~82%. Well-justified with explicit probability reconstruction. 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Addresses halved/doubled scenarios. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All items completed with explicit probability shifts documented. 4/4

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Structural/timing constraint as strong evidence. FedWatch and J.P. Morgan as moderate. Notes conflicting FedWatch odds across dates. 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 3.75 [3.50, 4.00] -> Output: 3.75 [3.25, 4.00]. Widened P10 from 3.50 to 3.25. Creative use of P40=3.74, P60=3.75, P80=3.76 to represent discrete probability mass. 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Pre-meeting concentrates on 3.75. Doubled window brings additional meeting. 4/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All items completed. Consistency check present. 4/4

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-4 (self, via fallback)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but effective hierarchy. Strong: FedWatch 80/20, one meeting. Moderate: CPI, dissents. 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Starting point is S1-4's own outside view (3.85 [3.25, 4.25]) via cross-pollination fallback. Constructs Hold 75%, Cut 22%, Hike 3%. Smoothed CDF bands approach is methodologically interesting. 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Adequate. If halved: +3% to hold. If doubled: cut rises >40%. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot identified (CPI shock). 3/4

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise. Strong: 70-75% base rate holds, one meeting, 0/60 inter-meeting. Moderate: FedWatch ~20% cut. 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 3.75 [3.25, 4.25] -> Output: 3.75 [3.30, 4.05]. Adjusts to 66% hold, 24% cut, 5% hike. Modest narrowing of tails from outside view. 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but adequate. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete but concise. 3/4

- **Score:** 12/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input (Median) | Final (Median) | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|-------------------|----------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 3.75 | 3.75 | 0 | 15/16 | Yes (reinforced hold; collapsed right tail -- debatable) |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 3.85 | 3.75 | -0.10 | 15/16 | Yes (corrected S1-4 excessive upside) |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 3.75 | 3.75 | 0 | 14/16 | Yes (validated outside view, widened downside) |
| S2-4 | o3 | 3.85 (S1-4 fallback) | 3.75 | -0.10 | 12/16 | Yes (received S1-4 via fallback; corrected median downward) |
| S2-5 | o3 | 3.75 | 3.75 | 0 | 12/16 | Yes (narrowed tails based on market data) |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4/o3):** Most significant test. S1-4 placed median at ~3.85 with P90=4.25. S2-2 correctly corrected to median 3.75 with P90=3.90, explicitly constructing new probability masses (82%/16%/2%). Demonstrates the inside view can override a poorly calibrated outside view.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2/Sonnet 4.5):** Engaged meaningfully, widening P10 from 3.50 to 3.25 while keeping the rest similar. Conservative approach reflects appropriate deference to a well-calibrated outside view.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-4/o3 via fallback):** S1-3 was truncated, so cross-pollination fallback routed S2-4 to its own S1-4 outside view (3.85 [3.25, 4.25]). S2-4's reference to an "outside-view distribution (10% ≤3.25%, 65% 3.75%, 25% 3.50%/hike tail)" is a paraphrased interpretation of S1-4's CDF. Fallback preserved a valid starting point but lost the intended cross-model diversity (o3 received o3 instead of GPT-5.2).

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** Divergent tail treatment. Sonnet 4.5 collapsed right tail (P90: 4.00->3.75) while o3 only modestly narrowed (P90: 4.25->4.05).

- **Net effect:** Moderately effective. Key success: S2-2 correcting S1-4. S1-3 truncation triggered fallback (S2-4 received S1-4 instead), preserving a valid starting point but reducing cross-model diversity. Convergence to median 3.75 was driven by dominant CME FedWatch evidence rather than cross-pollination dynamics.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: upper bound of Federal Funds Target Range effective March 31, 2026 (FRED DFEDTARU).
- All identified March 17-18, 2026 as the only FOMC meeting before resolution.
- All assessed current status: upper bound = 3.75% since January 28, 2026.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Current upper bound = 3.75% since January 28, 2026 FOMC hold
2. Two dissents at January meeting (Waller and Miran) favored 25bp cut
3. Next FOMC meeting March 17-18, 2026 is the only decision point before resolution
4. CME FedWatch shows ~80% probability hold, ~20% probability cut at March meeting
5. December dot plot median projects only one 25bp cut for all of 2026
6. January statement upgraded growth to "solid," removed "downside risks to employment"

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1 | Goldman Sachs rate reference | GS article references rate as "3.75%-4%" which may reflect an older rate level. Noted without correction. | Low |
| S2-4 | Inconsistent FedWatch probabilities | One source cited 8% March cut (Feb 4), another 19.9% (Feb 9). Appropriately downweighted older figure. | Low |
| S2-5 | Outside view probability mis-stated | Referenced 45% hold / 25% cut but S1-5 text stated different allocations. | Low |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All key facts confirmed by multiple research sources. The Agent report's meeting-by-meeting history is consistent with FRED data.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Universal median consensus at 3.75%:** All five inside views converged to median 3.75%, correctly identifying status quo as modal outcome for this single-meeting forecast window.
2. **Excellent research pipeline execution:** FRED integration delivered exact needed data. Agent report completed in 2 steps with comprehensive history and guidance synthesis -- best Agent performance observed.
3. **Good evidence integration:** All forecasters identified and weighted CME FedWatch 80/20, J.P. Morgan forecast, and January hawkish tilt as dominant evidence.
4. **Effective cross-pollination correction:** S2-2 successfully corrected S1-4's excessive right tail with well-justified probability reconstruction.

### Weaknesses
1. **GPT-5.2 outside view truncation:** 4000-token limit silently truncated GPT-5.2 outside view. Cross-pollination fallback routed S2-4 to its own S1-4 output, preserving the chain but losing cross-model diversity. Pipeline configuration issue (token limit too low for GPT-5.2).
2. **Aggregated CDF diverges from individuals:** Final P10=2.37, P90=4.80 far wider than any individual (P10: 3.25-3.50, P90: 3.75-4.05). CDF construction issue for discrete outcomes.
3. **o3 systematic right-tail bias:** Both o3 outside views assigned ~20% to hike outcomes despite no evidence. Consistent pattern.
4. **S2-1 right-tail collapse:** P90=3.75 (matching median) violates prompt instruction for wide tails and implies 0% upside probability.

### Overall Quality Grade

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

Reasoning: Strong consensus at the correct modal outcome (3.75%) with excellent research execution (FRED data, Agent report). All individual forecasters produced well-reasoned outputs. Downgraded from A due to: (1) GPT-5.2 outside view truncation reducing cross-model diversity (fallback preserved a valid starting point), (2) aggregated CDF producing percentiles wider than any individual forecaster, and (3) contrasting calibration failures (S2-1 right-tail collapse vs. o3 right-tail excess). The core forecast is sound and evidence-grounded.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- **Directly access CME FedWatch probability data:** CME pages returned only descriptions. Implement direct scraping or financial data API for the most critical current information.
- **Improve AskNews query targeting:** Many of 22 articles were irrelevant (Turkey, Brazil, Canada). More targeted query or relevance filter needed.
- **Surface SOFR futures data:** Would provide more granular probability distributions than binary hold/cut from news reports.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Fix GPT-5.2 token truncation:** Increase max_output_tokens for models that need more tokens, implement retry, or adjust cross-pollination routing when S1 output fails.
- **~~Handle missing S1 outputs:~~** *(Already implemented)* Cross-pollination fallback is in place: when a designated source fails, S2 falls back to self, then to any valid S1 output, with logged substitution. Worked correctly here (S2-4 received S1-4).
- **Investigate CDF aggregation for discrete outcomes:** Individual percentiles (P10: 3.25-3.50, P90: 3.75-4.05) diverge dramatically from aggregated (P10: 2.37, P90: 4.80). Consider discrete-outcome CDF mode for FOMC-type questions.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **o3 (Forecasters 4-5):** Systematic right-tail bias (~20% hike probability) in outside views. Consider domain-specific guidance for monetary policy about asymmetric tail risks in directional cycles.
- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** Truncation is pipeline issue. Inside view showed creative calibration (P40=3.74, P60=3.75, P80=3.76) -- good behavior when not token-constrained.
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Consistently strong. S2-1 right-tail collapse could be addressed by prompt language discouraging collapsing tails to median.

  S1-1 (Sonnet 4.5): 3.75 [3.25, 4.00]
  S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5): 3.75 [3.50, 4.00]
  S1-3 (GPT-5.2):    N/A  [N/A,  N/A]  ** TRUNCATED **
  S1-4 (o3):         3.85 [3.25, 4.25]
  S1-5 (o3):         3.75 [3.25, 4.25]

Step 2 Outputs (Inside View) - Median [10th, 90th]:
  S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5): 3.75 [3.25, 3.75] (received S1-1)
  S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5): 3.75 [3.50, 3.90] (received S1-4)
  S2-3 (GPT-5.2):    3.75 [3.25, 4.00] (received S1-2)
  S2-4 (o3):         3.75 [3.35, 4.05] (received S1-4 via fallback; S1-3 truncated)
  S2-5 (o3):         3.75 [3.30, 4.05] (received S1-5)

Final Aggregated: Median 3.70 [10th: 2.37, 90th: 4.80]
```

Note: The final aggregated percentiles (P10=2.37, P90=4.80) are substantially wider than any individual forecaster. This suggests the CDF aggregation/construction process is introducing smoothing artifacts when converting discrete-like percentile inputs to a 201-point continuous CDF.
