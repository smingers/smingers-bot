## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| o3 forecasters produced excessively wide upper tails | High | S2-4, S2-5 | Both o3 inside view outputs placed P90 at 5.4% and 5.2% respectively, implying ~10% probability of unemployment rising by a full percentage point in two months. This is far outside the historical two-month volatility (sigma ~0.14pp) and significantly wider than the other three forecasters (P90 = 4.7-4.8%). These outliers pulled the final aggregated P90 up to 5.45%, distorting the right tail of the submitted CDF. |
| BLS scrape value inconsistency for December 2025 | Medium | Research | The BLS page scrape (search_question_urls.json) reported December 2025 unemployment as 4.2%, while FRED and the Agent report both correctly show 4.4%. The BLS page text states "December 2025: 4.2%" which appears to be a parsing error (possibly confusing columns or reading a different row). All forecasters used the correct 4.4% value, so downstream impact was negligible, but this data inconsistency could mislead future forecasts. |
| AskNews returned irrelevant articles | Low | Research | Three of the 18 AskNews articles covered Polish unemployment rates (not U.S.), and one covered Japanese monetary policy. These wasted context window space and added noise. |
| AskNews deep research hit rate limit | Low | Research | AskNews deep research query was attempted but failed due to usage limits. The standard AskNews query still returned 18 articles, so impact was limited. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical only, 2 steps) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (current only; deep research failed) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | Yes (UNRATE series retrieved) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | N/A (numeric question) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (BLS data page scraped) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent, FRED):
1. `US unemployment rate 2025-2026 trend` (Google) -- 3 results
2. `January 2026 unemployment forecast March 2026` (Google News) -- 3 results
3. `Provide latest US U-3 unemployment rates through Jan 2026, discuss recent trend and summarize any professional forecasts for March 2026 unemployment; include historical comparisons with late-cycle periods such as 2006-08 and 2018-20.` (Agent) -- 2 steps, 1 report
4. `UNRATE` (FRED) -- 1 result (full time series)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. `January 2026 U-3 unemployment rate` (Google) -- 3 results
2. `US labor market outlook spring 2026` (Google News) -- 3 results
3. `Provide recent forecasts for U.S. unemployment through March 2026 from Fed, CBO, and major banks.` (AskNews) -- 18 articles

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Long-run data, 2025 trajectory, late-cycle comparisons | Jan 2026 data, spring 2026 outlook |
| Content type | Time series data, historical analogues, macro analysis | Expert forecasts, leading indicators, news flow |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent, FRED | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | FRED UNRATE series, historical volatility statistics, 2006-08 comparisons | Goldman Sachs Jan forecast, KPMG/RSM scenarios, Indeed Hiring Lab scenarios |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries correctly targeted base rate establishment (UNRATE time series, trend analysis, late-cycle analogues). Current queries surfaced recent professional forecasts and near-term labor market signals.
- The historical Google News query ("January 2026 unemployment forecast March 2026") has some overlap with current queries, but delivered useful JPMorgan and Nomura analysis.
- The Agent query was efficient (only 2 steps, vs. 7 in the previous 42038 forecast), executing 5 sub-queries across Google, Google News, and FRED. It produced a useful synthesis of professional forecasts clustering at 4.3-4.6% for March 2026.
- FRED integration worked correctly this time (unlike the 42038 forecast), delivering the full UNRATE series with summary statistics.
- The BLS question URL scrape provided historical monthly rates through December 2025, establishing the resolution source's data format.
- Critical information missed: No CBO or Federal Reserve projections were surfaced. The query explicitly requested "Fed, CBO, and major banks" but only bank forecasts appeared.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs were appropriately factual. The Agent report mentioned that "professional forecasts cluster around 4.3-4.6%" which is factual reporting of others' forecasts, not the research tool forecasting itself. AskNews articles quoted Goldman Sachs (4.4% for January), JPMorgan (4.5% peak early 2026), KPMG (4.5% stabilization), RSM (baseline 4.5%, adverse 5%+), and Indeed Hiring Lab scenarios (4.1-4.8% range). These are all appropriately presented as sourced expert opinions rather than the research pipeline's own predictions.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - December 2025 U-3 = 4.4% (confirmed by BLS, FRED, multiple articles)
  - January 2026 consensus = 4.4% (Goldman Sachs, consensus previews)
  - Professional forecast cluster for Q1 2026: 4.3-4.6%, centered 4.4-4.5%
  - "Low-hire, low-fire" labor market characterization (multiple sources)
  - Historical two-month volatility statistics (Agent report, FRED data)
  - Key leading indicators: initial claims ~200k (low), JOLTS openings declining, weak payroll growth (~50k/month)
  - Dec 2025 benchmark revision: ~900k fewer jobs than previously reported
  - Immigration restrictions reducing labor supply / lowering breakeven employment
- **Critical information missed:**
  - No CBO or Fed (SEP) unemployment projections surfaced
  - No Bloomberg/Reuters consensus survey median for March 2026 specifically
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Good. JPMorgan, Newsweek, Trading Economics, Nomura all provided relevant data. FM Magazine (Asia focus) and CNBC/BOJ article were irrelevant but correctly identified and dismissed by forecasters.
  - Agent report: Good -- efficient 2-step execution with useful synthesis of multiple professional forecasts. Significant improvement over the 7-step Agent in the 42038 forecast.
  - AskNews articles: Mixed volume (18 articles). Several highly relevant (Goldman Sachs preview, Investopedia, Indeed Hiring Lab, RSM, KPMG). Three Polish unemployment articles and one Japanese monetary policy article were irrelevant noise.
  - FRED data: Excellent. UNRATE series provided confirmed recent values and summary statistics (1-year mean 4.25%, range 4.0-4.5%).
  - Question URL scrape: Good concept but BLS page parsing produced an incorrect December 2025 value of 4.2% (should be 4.4%).

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

The outside view prompt asks each instance to:
- (a) Analyze sources, evaluate quality, distinguish fact from opinion
- (b) Identify reference classes, evaluate suitability, choose best one
- (c) State prediction timeframe, examine historical patterns
- (d) Justify the outside view prediction

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all 9 sources with quality ratings. Correctly identifies BLS/FRED as primary, JPMorgan as "expert opinion from major institution," Newsweek as "quality varies by quoted source," Agent report as "high-quality synthesis," and correctly dismisses FM Magazine and CNBC/BOJ as irrelevant. Distinguishes fact from opinion throughout. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 reference classes: (1) recent 3-month changes, (2) post-pandemic normalization, (3) late-cycle plateaus (2006-07, 2018-19). Selects combination of (1) and (3), correctly noting the 2006-07 comparison is apt because both show mid-4% unemployment with slowing growth and policy uncertainty. Good justification. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 1.5-month horizon. Provides specific 2-3 month changes throughout 2025 (e.g., "Jan-Mar 2025: +0.2pp"). Notes seasonal adjustment reduces bias. Correctly observes most 2-3 month moves in 2025 were within +/-0.2pp. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchors on 4.4% with clear directional factor analysis (upward: weak hiring, tariffs, expert forecasts of 4.5%; downward: immigration restrictions, fiscal stimulus, low layoffs). Derives 10th-90th range of 4.1-4.8% with explicit tail risk justification. Minor issue: P90 at 4.8% is wider than historical 2-3 month volatility would suggest but justified by structural uncertainties. 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate anchored at 4.4-4.5% with slight upward bias -- appropriate given evidence.
- Distribution shows slight right skew, consistent with stated "greater upside risk than downside."
- P10=4.1 to P90=4.8 spans 0.7pp, well-calibrated for a 1.5-month horizon on a historically inertial series.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Very thorough. Evaluates all sources with quality tags ("High," "Medium"). Correctly identifies Agent report limitations and notes paywalled Capital Economics content. Nearly identical quality to S1-1. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes: (1) recent monthly changes, (2) late-cycle periods 2006-08/2018-20, (3) post-2020 recovery. Selects (1) with professional forecasts as anchors. Reasonable but less distinctive than S1-1's combination approach. Weaker justification for why (2) was not selected. 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 1.5-month horizon. Provides specific period-over-period changes. Notes average absolute 3-month change at ~0.15pp. Correctly observes recent stabilization (Nov 4.5% to Dec 4.4%). 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Nearly identical distribution to S1-1 (P10=4.1, P90=4.7). Well-structured reasoning anchored on professional forecast range of 4.3-4.6%. Tighter P90 (4.7 vs 4.8) reflects more conservative tail. 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Distribution very similar to S1-1, reducing effective ensemble diversity.
- P10=4.1, P90=4.7 -- slightly tighter than S1-1, reflecting slightly more confidence in persistence.
- Appropriate distribution shape with slight positive skew.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but effective. Evaluates all 8 sources with quality ratings and date stamps. Good distinction between factual data and opinion/forecast. Correctly dismisses FM Magazine and CNBC/BOJ. Notes that Agent report claims should "ideally be checked in primary sources." 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 reference classes: (1) short-horizon conditional persistence, (2) late-cycle drift-up episodes, (3) unconditional historical distribution (correctly rejected as "too broad; ignores strong persistence"). Selects (1) augmented with (2) for asymmetric tail risk. Excellent reasoning: "Chosen reference class: Short-horizon conditional persistence, augmented with late-cycle drift-up for asymmetric upside tail risk." 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states ~7 weeks to March data month. Provides specific historical pattern data: monthly changes commonly 0.0 to +/-0.1pp, larger 2-3 month moves (>=+0.5pp) cluster around recessions. Good quantification of tail risk frequency. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchors on 4.4% with wider tails than Sonnet models (P10=4.1, P90=5.2). Explicitly justifies inflated upper tail: "inflating the upper tail to reflect the empirical fact that unemployment can move nonlinearly at turning points." P80=4.8 is a significant jump from P60=4.5 -- this creates a distinctly fat right tail. 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Distribution introduces meaningful diversity with wider upper tail (P90=5.2 vs Sonnet models' 4.7-4.8).
- P90=5.2 implies ~10% probability of unemployment rising by 0.8pp in two months -- defensible as a tail risk but on the high side of historical frequency.
- Distribution explicitly motivated by "conditional persistence + tail inflation" -- a principled approach.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and effective. Covers all sources with quality ratings. Correctly identifies BLS/FRED as primary, notes Agent report as "medium quality meta-source," dismisses irrelevant articles. Separates fact from opinion. 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 candidate classes. Selects "Two-month changes when the starting rate is 3.5-5.0% and no recession has yet started (1960-present)." Provides specific empirical statistics: n~250 pairs, mean change 0.00pp, std-dev 0.14pp, |Delta|>0.30pp in 7% of cases, >0.50pp in 2%. This is the most rigorous quantitative derivation of any forecaster. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly notes 50-day horizon. States persistence coefficient rho~0.9. Notes historical rarity of >0.2pp moves in non-recession periods. Brief but accurate. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses sigma=0.14pp per month with explicit calculation. Derives central 60% band at 4.2-4.6% (+/-0.2pp from center). P10=4.1, P90=4.9 -- wider than pure sigma would suggest but justified by "deliberately wider than pure historical sigma to account for model error, policy shocks, and data revisions." 4/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Most rigorous quantitative derivation: explicit distributional parameters (n=250, sigma=0.14pp), z-score-based calculations.
- P10=4.1, P90=4.9 -- 0.8pp 80% interval is well-calibrated, slightly wider than pure normal distribution would give to account for fat tails.
- Slight downward bias in median (closer to 4.3-4.4 than 4.4-4.5) compared to expert consensus.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise. Covers all sources with brief quality assessments. Correctly identifies primary vs secondary sources. Less detailed than other outputs but adequate. 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 candidate classes: (i) all months, all levels, (ii) months where unemployment was 4-5% two months earlier (n~140), (iii) late-cycle plateau episodes. Selects (ii) as best balance of sample size and similarity. Provides useful statistics: |Delta|<=0.3pp in 70% of cases, larger moves only in recessions. 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly notes horizon <3 months. States IQR ~+/-0.2pp for two-month changes. Brief but adequate. 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses sigma=0.16pp per month, calculates sqrt(2)*0.16 = 0.23pp for two months. For Normal(4.4, 0.23), derives 10th/90th at 4.0/4.8, then widens by ~0.1pp each side for fat tails. Final P10=3.9, P90=5.1. The P10=3.9 is an outlier (0.2pp lower than all other forecasters). P90=5.1 is wider than S1-4's 4.9. 4/4 -- the derivation is mathematically explicit and principled even if the distribution is wide.

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Most explicitly mathematical derivation: Normal(4.4, 0.23) with fat-tail widening.
- P10=3.9 is an outlier, implying 10% probability of unemployment dropping by 0.5pp in two months -- historically very rare without a strong positive shock.
- P90=5.1 similarly wide, implying 0.7pp increase. Together these give a 1.2pp 80% interval, wider than other forecasters.

- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Median [P10, P90]) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|-------------------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~4.45 [4.1, 4.8] | 15/16 | Thorough source analysis with all 9 sources evaluated, well-reasoned directional factors | Nearly identical to S1-2, limiting diversity |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~4.45 [4.1, 4.7] | 13/16 | Good February-specific historical comparisons | Very similar to S1-1; weaker reference class justification |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~4.45 [4.1, 5.2] | 14/16 | Best-articulated tail inflation rationale ("conditional persistence + asymmetric risk") | P90=5.2 may over-weight recession tail |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~4.35 [4.1, 4.9] | 15/16 | Most rigorous quantitative derivation (n=250, sigma=0.14pp, explicit z-scores) | Slightly low median vs expert consensus |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~4.35 [3.9, 5.1] | 13/16 | Explicit mathematical framework (Normal + fat-tail widening) | P10=3.9 is outlier low; overall distribution too wide |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

The inside view prompt asks each instance to:
- (a) Analyze current sources, evaluate quality, distinguish fact from opinion
- (b) Weight evidence using Strong/Moderate/Weak framework
- (c) State timeframe, describe how prediction changes if halved/doubled
- (d) Justify shift from outside view base rate

Plus complete the calibration checklist.

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (Median [P10, P90]) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | ~4.45 [4.1, 4.8] |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~4.35 [4.1, 4.9] |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~4.45 [4.1, 4.7] |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ~4.45 [4.1, 5.2] |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | ~4.35 [3.9, 5.1] |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong: January 2026 actual = 4.4% (just released), expert consensus clustering at 4.4-4.5% (JPM, KPMG, TE, RSM, Goldman), structural "low-hire, low-fire" environment. Moderate: benchmark revision (900k fewer jobs), immigration restrictions reducing labor supply, tariff/policy uncertainty. Weak: AI productivity gains, fiscal stimulus expectations. Clear, well-organized categorization. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~4.45 [4.1, 4.8] -> Output: 4.45 [4.2, 4.7]. Tightened both tails modestly. Explicit justification: "Tightening around the center (4.4-4.5%) due to very short timeframe and January actual of 4.4%." Left tail raised from 4.1 to 4.2 given structural weak hiring; right tail lowered from 4.8 to 4.7. Direction and magnitude well-justified. 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Excellent. Explicitly addresses halved ("predict even closer to current 4.4%, distribution would tighten significantly") and doubled ("shift distribution slightly higher toward 4.5-4.6% with wider tails"). Notes 4-5 week timeframe reinforces inertia. 4/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 7 items completed meaningfully. Target variable paraphrased. Base rate stated and compared. Consistency check (median ~4.45, mean ~4.46). Top evidence pieces listed with verification. Blind spot identified (unexpected fiscal stimulus or sudden recession trigger). Status quo acknowledged (40th percentile at 4.4%). Technicalities verified. 4/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Both central estimate AND uncertainty range updated appropriately: slight tightening reflects stronger information from January actual.
- Tails well-calibrated: P10=4.2 and P90=4.7 give a 0.5pp 80% interval, tight and appropriate for 4-5 week horizon.
- Distribution strictly increasing, all values within bounds.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good application of framework. Identifies same key evidence as S2-1 with similar categorization. Correctly weights hard data (Dec-2025 = 4.4%, claims ~200k) as strong. Notes expert consensus (JPM, KPMG, Goldman, RSM) clustering at 4.3-4.5%. Slightly less detailed than S2-1. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~4.35 [4.1, 4.9] -> Output: 4.40 [4.1, 4.8]. Modest adjustment from S1-4's slightly lower median. Tightened upper tail from 4.9 to 4.8. Explicit justification: "Tighten upper tail slightly (90th: 4.9%->4.8%): Expert consensus shows no credible forecast above 4.8% for Q1-2026." Maintains lower tail at 4.1. Good reasoning about RSM's adverse scenario being full-year not Q1-specific. 3/4 (slightly less explicit about why P60 shifted up from S1-4's 4.4 to 4.5)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Addresses halved ("tighter distribution around 4.4%, likely 4.3-4.5% for 80% interval") and doubled ("widen distribution to 4.2-4.7%"). Correct directional reasoning. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and well-done. All 7 items present. Consistency check (median = 4.4%, mean ~4.42%). Blind spot identified (sudden financial shock). Status quo properly assessed. 4/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Good engagement with the cross-pollinated S1-4 input. Maintained S1-4's lower tail at 4.1 while tightening upper tail.
- Final distribution well-calibrated and similar to S2-1 despite receiving a different outside view.
- P10=4.1, P90=4.8 -- slightly wider than S2-1 but defensible.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework application. Identifies similar strong evidence (professional forecast clustering, status quo/inertia, low-hire/low-fire characterization). Notes "freshest reporting (Feb 2026) stresses weak hiring, low openings." Good distinction between strong, moderate, and weak evidence. 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~4.45 [4.1, 4.7] -> Output: 4.50 [4.1, 4.8]. Shifted median up by 0.05pp and widened upper tail from 4.7 to 4.8. Explicit justification: "keep the median near 4.5, keep lower tail similar, but raise the upper tail a touch (to 4.8 at the 90th) to reflect a non-trivial risk of further softening." Direction correct (slight upward shift matching expert consensus). 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Notes ~7 weeks to March reference month. Explicitly states "If timeframe were halved: I'd tighten around 4.4-4.5 with thinner tails. If timeframe were doubled: I'd widen and tilt slightly higher." 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All items completed. Target variable stated. Base rate referenced. Consistency check present (implied median ~4.45-4.50, mean ~4.52). Key evidence listed. Blind spot identified (sudden negative shock). Status quo acknowledged. Technicalities verified. 4/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Good engagement with cross-pollinated S1-2 input. Appropriately widened upper tail while maintaining lower tail.
- Slight upward shift in median (4.45 -> 4.50) reflects updated evidence from current sources showing expert consensus at 4.5%.
- Final distribution well-calibrated with principled reasoning for the shift.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but covers key evidence. Strong: historical persistence, multiple institutional forecasts at 4.4-4.6%. Moderate: leading indicators softening (JOLTS down, layoff announcements up), structural labor-supply squeeze. Weak: benchmark revision speculation, consumer sentiment. 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~4.45 [4.1, 5.2] -> Output: 4.50 [4.1, 5.4]. This is problematic. The forecaster WIDENED the upper tail from S1-3's already-wide P90=5.2 to P90=5.4, and pushed P80 from 4.8 to 5.0. The stated justification: "Thicken the upper tail (give 10% chance >=5.4%)." However, this implies a 10% chance that unemployment rises by a full percentage point in two months, which has occurred in only ~1-2% of historical non-recession two-month intervals. The stated mean (~4.63%) is significantly above the expert consensus of 4.4-4.5%. 2/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but adequate. "If the horizon were halved (March -> mid-Feb rate) I would tighten the distribution by ~20%. If doubled (looking to May 2026) I would widen the 80-90th tail by ~0.3pp." 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete but brief. All 7 items present. Consistency check: "implied median ~4.55%, mean ~4.63%." The mean of 4.63% is notably higher than any other forecaster's mean, which should have triggered a recalibration. Blind spot identified (sudden credit shock). 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- P80=5.0 and P90=5.4 create an excessively fat right tail. The implied 20% probability of unemployment exceeding 5.0% by March is far higher than historical base rates (~2-5% in non-recession contexts).
- The central estimate (P40=4.4, P60=4.6) is reasonable, but the upper tail distorts the overall CDF.
- This output is the primary driver of the aggregated P90 being pulled up to 5.45%.

- **Score:** 11/16

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise. Correctly identifies strong evidence (historical inertia, professional forecast clustering at 4.4-4.5%). Moderate evidence (payroll revision signals, JOLTS/layoffs). Weak evidence (consumer surveys, FX pieces). Adequate but less detailed than S2-1 or S2-2. 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: ~4.35 [3.9, 5.1] -> Output: 4.40 [4.1, 5.2]. Corrected the lower tail from 3.9 to 4.1 (appropriate -- 3.9% was too optimistic). However, maintained the wide upper tail at P90=5.2, and actually widened P80 from 4.7 to 4.75. Stated justification: "nudge median to 4.45%, fatten right tail, trim left." The left-tail correction was good, but maintaining P90=5.2 perpetuates the over-wide right tail issue. 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief. "Days to March survey week ~35; days to BLS release ~60. If the horizon were halved distribution narrows ~15%; if doubled tails widen ~30%." Adequate but minimal analysis. 2/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All items present. Consistency check: "Mean ~4.48%, st.dev ~0.23%, skew slightly right." Blind spot identified. Status quo checked. 3/4

**Numeric-specific assessment:**
- Good correction of S1-5's outlier P10=3.9 to a more reasonable 4.1.
- Upper tail at P90=5.2 remains problematically wide (same issue as S2-4 though slightly less extreme).
- Central estimates (P40=4.35, P60=4.45) are well-calibrated.
- Distribution has larger standard deviation than warranted by the historical two-month volatility.

- **Score:** 11/16

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4/o3):** Good engagement. Received S1-4's quantitatively rigorous but slightly low-median outside view (4.35). S2-2 appropriately adjusted upward to 4.40 and tightened the upper tail from 4.9 to 4.8, reflecting the current evidence of expert consensus at 4.4-4.5%. The cross-pollination provided useful diversity -- S2-2's final distribution (P10=4.1, P90=4.8) is slightly wider than S2-1's (4.2, 4.7), capturing more tail uncertainty from the o3 input.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2/Sonnet 4.5):** Engaged with S1-2's conservative distribution (P90=4.7) and appropriately widened the upper tail to 4.8 while shifting the median slightly upward. This is a sensible cross-model update -- GPT-5.2 incorporated the Sonnet baseline while applying its own assessment of upside risk from softening labor data.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3/GPT-5.2):** Counterproductive cross-pollination. S1-3 had an already-wide P90 of 5.2. Rather than moderating this tail (as the current evidence of expert consensus at 4.4-4.5% would suggest), S2-4 actually widened it further to 5.4. The GPT-5.2 input's "tail inflation" philosophy appears to have reinforced o3's own tendency toward wide distributions.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5) and S2-5 (o3) show meaningful model-specific differences despite both receiving self-model inputs. S2-1 produced a tight, well-calibrated distribution (P10=4.2, P90=4.7) while S2-5 maintained a wide right tail (P10=4.1, P90=5.2). This confirms the o3 tendency toward wider tails is a model characteristic, not an artifact of cross-pollination.

- **Net effect on diversity:** Cross-pollination had limited positive impact. S2-2 benefited modestly (slightly wider tails than S2-1). S2-3 made a principled adjustment. S2-4's cross-pollination was counterproductive. The dominant source of diversity in final outputs was model-specific tendencies (Sonnet 4.5 tight vs o3 wide) rather than cross-pollination structure.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: seasonally adjusted U-3 unemployment rate for March 2026 from BLS series LNS14000000.
- All correctly identified the approximate timeframe: ~50-65 days to March survey week, data release expected early April 2026.
- All correctly assessed current status: December 2025 = 4.4%, with January 2026 consensus also at 4.4%.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. December 2025 U-3 = 4.4% (confirmed by BLS, FRED, multiple articles)
2. January 2026 consensus forecast = 4.4% (Goldman Sachs, consensus previews)
3. "Low-hire, low-fire" labor market with weak payroll growth (~50-70k/month)
4. Expert forecast cluster for Q1 2026: 4.3-4.6%, centered 4.4-4.5% (JPM, KPMG, Trading Economics, RSM)
5. Historical two-month changes typically within +/-0.2pp outside recessions
6. Initial claims remaining low (~200k), indicating minimal layoff pressure
7. Immigration restrictions reducing labor supply and lowering breakeven employment

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Research (BLS scrape) | BLS Dec-2025 value mismatch | BLS page scrape reported Dec 2025 as 4.2%, while FRED and Agent report show 4.4% | Low (all forecasters used correct 4.4%) |
| S2-1 | January 2026 pre-release claim | States "January 2026 U-3 at 4.4% (released Feb 11, 2026)" but forecast date is Feb 10, meaning this was consensus expectation not actual data | Low (consensus was indeed 4.4%) |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. All key facts (December 2025 = 4.4%, expert consensus 4.4-4.5%, initial claims ~200k, JOLTS declining, payroll benchmark revision) are confirmed by multiple independent research sources. S1-4's empirical statistics (n=250 pairs, sigma=0.14pp) are plausible and consistent with known labor market time series properties, though not directly verifiable from the research outputs.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research execution:** FRED integration worked, Agent completed efficiently in 2 steps, question URL scraping provided BLS historical data. Total research cost reasonable at $0.25.
2. **Strong central estimates:** All 5 forecasters converged on medians of 4.40-4.50%, consistent with expert consensus and historical persistence. The median spread of 0.1pp demonstrates genuine analytical convergence.
3. **Rigorous outside view derivations:** S1-1 and S1-4 both scored 15/16, with S1-4 providing the most quantitatively rigorous reference class analysis (explicit n, sigma, z-score calculations) in any assessment to date.
4. **S2-1 exemplary performance:** Scored 16/16 with complete and meaningful calibration checklist, well-justified evidence weighting, and appropriate distribution tightening from outside to inside view.

### Weaknesses
1. **o3 upper tail inflation:** Both o3 inside-view outputs (S2-4 and S2-5) produced P90 values far exceeding historical two-month volatility (5.4% and 5.2% vs ~4.7-4.8% for other models). This pulled the final aggregated P90 up to 5.45%, significantly distorting the submitted CDF's right tail.
2. **Limited Sonnet 4.5 diversity:** S1-1 and S1-2 produced nearly identical distributions (P10=4.1, P90=4.7-4.8), reducing the effective ensemble size from 5 to ~4 distinct perspectives in the outside view.
3. **BLS scrape data error:** The question URL scraping reported December 2025 as 4.2% when the actual value is 4.4%. While forecasters ignored this error, it represents a pipeline reliability concern.
4. **AskNews noise:** 4 of 18 articles were irrelevant (3 Polish, 1 Japanese), wasting context window space.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

Reasoning: Strong central estimates with tight ensemble consensus around 4.4-4.5%, excellent research execution (FRED worked, Agent efficient, good source diversity), and exemplary performance from S2-1. Downgraded from A due to: (1) o3 forecasters producing excessively wide upper tails that significantly distort the submitted CDF's P90 (5.45% vs ~4.7-4.8% if o3 outputs were excluded), (2) BLS scrape data inconsistency (4.2% vs actual 4.4%), and (3) limited Sonnet 4.5 diversity. The core forecast (central estimates, P10-P75) is well-calibrated, but the right tail is problematic.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- **Filter AskNews results by geography:** Implement a post-filtering step to remove articles about non-U.S. unemployment when the question specifically asks about U.S. data. Three Polish articles and one Japanese monetary policy article wasted context space.
- **Validate question URL scrape values:** Cross-check scraped values against FRED data when both are available. Flag discrepancies (e.g., BLS page showing 4.2% for Dec 2025 vs FRED showing 4.4%).
- **Add CBO/Fed SEP data source:** The current query explicitly requested "Fed, CBO, and major banks" but no Federal Reserve or CBO projections were surfaced. Consider adding these as explicit search targets for economic indicator questions.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Cap ensemble tail spread:** Consider implementing a post-aggregation check that flags or clips outlier tails. If one forecaster's P90 exceeds the median P90 by more than 50%, log a warning and consider robust aggregation methods (e.g., trimmed mean for tail percentiles).
- **Add historical volatility constraint to inside view prompt:** For economic indicators, include language like "Historical two-month absolute changes at this starting level exceed X% only Y% of the time. Your 90th percentile should be consistent with this frequency unless you identify specific near-term catalysts." This would help prevent S2-4's P90=5.4% on a series with sigma=0.14pp/month.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **o3 (Forecasters 4-5):** Both o3 instances produced excessively wide right tails in the inside view (P90=5.4 and 5.2). S1-4's outside view was exemplary (15/16), but S2-4 degraded from that strong foundation by widening rather than tightening the upper tail. The issue appears to be that o3 systematically over-weights tail risk scenarios during the inside view stage, even when current evidence supports stability. Consider whether o3's forecasting temperature should be lowered, or whether an explicit tail-calibration instruction should be added to the inside view prompt for o3.
- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** Solid performance across both stages (14/16 outside, 14/16 inside). Its "conditional persistence + tail inflation" framework in the outside view was principled and well-articulated.
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Consistently strong. S2-1 scored 16/16 -- the best inside view performance in the ensemble. However, the two Sonnet instances produced nearly identical outside views, limiting effective ensemble diversity. Consider whether the two Sonnet instances should receive different temperature settings or instruction variants to increase diversity.
