## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster 3 (GPT-5.2) outside view significantly higher than ensemble | High | S1-3 | Produced an outside view of 11.8%, roughly 4x higher than the other four forecasters (2.3%-4%), by assigning a ~10% base rate for EU code revision within a quarter. While individually defensible, this represents a major outlier that propagated to inflate the final aggregation. |
| AskNews results overwhelmingly irrelevant | Medium | Research | Of 17 AskNews articles returned, the vast majority concern EU antitrust action against Meta/WhatsApp -- entirely unrelated to GPAI Code of Practice revision. Only 3-4 articles had tangential relevance to EU AI policy. Deep research also failed with 403 error. |
| Forecaster 4 inside view retained inflated probability from cross-pollinated outlier | Medium | S2-4 | Despite receiving S1-3's 11.8% outlier outside view, S2-4 (o3) only reduced this to 9% -- still 3x higher than the other four inside views. The +2pp adjustment for copyright consultation being "folded into the Code" was speculative and contradicted the source material. |
| Potential confusion between GPAI Code and Article 50 transparency Code | Low | Research | The Lexology "Winter AI wrap" article mentions a separate "draft Code of Practice on transparency of AI-generated content" with drafts expected March 2026. Multiple forecasters correctly identified this as a different code, but the presence of this information in the research could cause confusion. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical only, 2 steps) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (current only; deep research failed with 403) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | N/A (not relevant) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | N/A (not relevant) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | N/A (binary question) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (scraped primary resolution source) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. `European Commission "GPAI code of practice" draft` (Google) -- 3 results
2. `GPAI code of practice consultation launch` (Google News) -- 3 results
3. `Provide a chronological list of every publicly released draft or version of the European Commission's General-Purpose AI Code of Practice (including consultation drafts) from 2023 through February 2026, with publication dates, document titles, and links. Note whether any official sources mention a forthcoming "revised" or "new" draft.` (Agent) -- 2 steps, 5 sub-queries, 1 report

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. `AI Office revised GPAI draft` (Google) -- 3 results
2. `European Commission GPAI code practice update` (Google News) -- 3 results
3. `Has the EU AI Office released a new draft version of the General-Purpose AI Code of Practice in 2026? Focus on official EU websites and press releases.` (AskNews) -- 17 articles

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Complete drafting history 2024-2025, institutional review cycles | Post-July 2025 developments, Feb 2026 status |
| Content type | Official EU documents, legal commentary, chronological reconstruction | News articles, recent policy updates, antitrust enforcement |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Full draft timeline (Nov 2024-Jul 2025), two-year review clause, finalization context | Confirmation of no recent revision, separate Article 50 code activity, current Commission priorities |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries correctly targeted the drafting chronology and institutional context, which is the most relevant information for a "will they revise?" question. Current queries targeted recent signals of revision activity.
- The Agent query was well-formulated and efficient (only 2 steps vs. the 7 steps seen in some other forecasts). It produced a comprehensive chronological catalogue of all drafts and explicitly addressed whether any official sources mention a forthcoming revised draft -- directly relevant to resolution.
- The question URL scraping was well-targeted, scraping the primary resolution source (digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-code-practice), which provided authoritative context about the drafting process.
- AskNews hit rate was poor: most articles concerned Meta/WhatsApp antitrust enforcement. The AskNews query was appropriately specific to the GPAI code, but the search engine returned topically adjacent rather than directly relevant results. The deep research query failed with a 403 usage-limit error.
- Critical information was successfully surfaced: final Code published July 10, 2025; two-year review cycle; no revision announced as of February 2026; separate Article 50 transparency code in development.
- No significant information gaps were identified for this question type. The key question is essentially "has anything changed?" and the research convincingly established that it has not.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs were appropriately factual. The Agent report concluded with a factual assessment rather than a probability: "As of February 2026, no new draft or revision has been published or formally announced." Article summaries correctly distinguished between factual reporting and named-source opinions (e.g., MEP Benifei's criticisms). No research output inappropriately offered probability estimates for the resolution question.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Complete chronology: 1st draft (Nov 2024), 2nd draft (Dec 2024), 3rd draft (Mar 2025), final (Jul 2025)
  - Final Code explicitly labeled "final" and endorsed by Commission/AI Board on Aug 1, 2025
  - Two-year review clause: "reviewed regularly -- at least every two years"
  - No official announcement or consultation for a revised draft as of Feb 2026
  - Separate Article 50 transparency code in development (distinct from GPAI Code)
  - Copyright-protocol consultation (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026) is about implementation details, not Code revision
- **Critical information missed:**
  - None identified. For this question, the absence of evidence for revision is itself the most important finding, and the research thoroughly established this absence.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: High quality. Surfaced official EU pages, reputable law firm analyses (Jones Day, Crowell and Moring, Taylor Wessing), and relevant policy commentary.
  - Agent report: Excellent. Comprehensive chronological reconstruction with clear sourcing. Efficient execution (2 steps). Explicitly addressed the key question of whether any official sources mention a forthcoming revised draft.
  - AskNews articles: Poor relevance. Overwhelmingly about Meta/WhatsApp antitrust, not GPAI Code revision. The few relevant articles (Lexology, Mondaq) provided useful background on the AI Act compliance framework but no new information about Code revision. Deep research failed.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all sources. Categorizes into official EU sources, legal/professional commentary, and agent report. Correctly distinguishes factual content from opinion. Notes that Inside Privacy mentions future updates but frames it correctly as consultation context, not revision announcement. Identifies the Agent report's key finding explicitly. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three plausible reference classes: EU regulatory codes generally, AI Act implementation documents, and similar EU digital policy frameworks (GDPR codes of conduct, DSA/DMA). Selects a combination of the first two with good justification: codes typically have long gaps between publication and revision, and the two-year review cycle confirms this. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies the 80-day forecast window (Feb 10 - May 1, 2026). Provides a detailed timeline of events since the July 2025 finalization showing no substantive revision activity. Notes that the copyright consultation is complementary, not a Code revision. Correctly identifies the 2.5-month window as very short for EU processes. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Reasoning is clear and well-structured. Identifies six specific factors pointing toward "No." Considers potential upset scenarios (urgent technical/legal issues, accelerated processes) but correctly assesses these as unlikely. Arrives at 4% with explicit reasoning about what 5%, 2%, and 10% would each mean in odds terms. Minor issue: does not compute an explicit numerical base rate from the reference class before adjusting -- the 4% emerges from qualitative reasoning rather than quantitative calculation. 3/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Clearly considers both Yes and No pathways. The Yes pathway requires unexpected implementation problems and unprecedented EU process acceleration. The No pathway is supported by all available evidence.
- Final probability of 4% is internally consistent with the analysis.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Very thorough. Evaluates all sources with quality assessments. Correctly identifies the key factual findings: final Code published July 2025, two-year review cycle, no revision announced as of Feb 2026, copyright consultation is implementation-focused. Distinguishes fact from commentary effectively. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies four reference classes including stated review cycles in EU documents. Selects the two-year review cycle combined with typical EU practice as the most suitable reference class. Good reasoning but somewhat tautological -- using the stated review cycle as both reference class and evidence. 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 80-day window. Provides detailed historical pattern analysis. Notes that the original drafting process took 9 months, so even a revision would need 3-6 months minimum. Good analysis of why 80 days is insufficient. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Well-structured reasoning. Identifies six specific justification points. Calibration section explicitly considers different probability levels (1%, 5%) and why 3% is appropriate. Good acknowledgment of upset scenarios while explaining why they are unlikely. 3/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Clear consideration of Yes/No pathways. Identifies the only positive factor as the possibility of unexpected developments.
- Final probability of 3% is well-justified and consistent with the analysis.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive analysis of all 8 sources with explicit quality ratings and dates. Excellent separation of facts from interpretations. Correctly notes the Agent report's "mixed sourcing, some unverifiable links" while accepting its high-level conclusion. Best treatment of source reliability among all outputs. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three plausible reference classes: EU codes of practice tied to major digital regulation, Commission guidance documents/Q&As, and technical protocol consultations. Selects the first as most suitable with strong justification: these instruments "rarely re-enter 'draft' status within a couple of months unless there is a major error, political reset, or implementation crisis." 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 80-day window. Good analysis of process timing constraints: publishing a revised draft requires internal decision, drafting, consultation wrapper, and translation/legal checks. Notes that revisions are "not routine on a sub-quarterly basis." 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts with an anchor of ~10% for "unlikely but not crazy" and adjusts modestly downward based on evidence. However, the initial 10% anchor seems high and is not well-justified by the reference class analysis, which suggested revisions are "rare" in the first year. The final 11.8% prediction is substantially higher than the other four outputs and seems to insufficiently weight the very strong evidence against revision. 2/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Identifies three specific pathways to "Yes" and explains why each is unlikely. Good analysis.
- The 11.8% prediction is the outlier -- nearly 4x the median of the other outputs. While the reasoning for keeping a "non-trivial tail risk" is stated, it is not well-supported by the evidence, which is overwhelmingly negative.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but thorough. Evaluates all 8 sources with quality and reliability assessments. Correctly identifies key facts vs. opinions. Good treatment of the Inside Privacy blog and its forward-looking implications. 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies two reference classes with specific historical examples: EU voluntary codes (Disinformation Code, Hate Speech Code, Cloud Switching Code) with typical revision intervals of 30-60 months, and EU soft-law guidance under new tech legislation. Selects the first class with strong justification. Provides the most concrete historical data points of any output: "3 codes, 0 instances of a completely new draft within the first 12 months." Excellent reference class work. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 80-day window. Notes that historically "no EU code identified was revised in <12 months; only one (hate-speech code) saw a revision in <24 months." Strong quantitative reasoning about why 80 days is insufficient even given the low annual base rate. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Excellent quantitative derivation: starts with 1/8 = 12.5% annual base rate, adjusts for 80-day window (11% of year) to get 1.4%, applies 2x upset multiplier to reach 2.8%, rounds to 3%. This is the most rigorous and transparent calculation in the ensemble. Clear mathematical chain from reference class to final number. 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Strong quantitative reasoning throughout. The 3% probability is well-justified by the base rate calculation.
- Good consideration of both Yes and No pathways with appropriate weighting.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise evaluation of all sources. Correctly separates facts from opinions. Notes that only Kluwer and Lexology pieces express views. Appropriately dismisses AskNews articles as irrelevant. 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies two reference classes with specific examples (Disinformation Code, Cloud Switching Code, Online Advertising Code). Notes first revision typically >2 years. Similar approach to S1-4 but slightly less detailed. Good justification. 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 80-day window. Notes no EU code was revised within <12 months and most took >30 months. Good quantitative framing. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts with 3% baseline (Codes revised within 12 months), adjusts for 80-day window using proportional reduction: 3% x 0.22 = 0.8%, adds 0.4% for political salience and 1% for unknown unknowns, arrives at 2.2%, rounds to 2.3%. Clear mathematical chain, well-justified. 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Very strong quantitative reasoning. The 2.3% is the lowest outside view and represents a principled calculation.
- Perhaps slightly overconfident -- the 2.3% may not adequately account for the possibility that EU processes could be triggered by events outside the information set. But within the evidence available, the derivation is sound.

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 4% | 15/16 | Thorough source analysis, well-structured qualitative reasoning | Base rate derived qualitatively rather than quantitatively |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 3% | 14/16 | Good timeline analysis, explicit calibration reasoning | Reference class somewhat tautological |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 11.8% | 14/16 | Best source reliability assessment, well-identified pathways | Initial anchor too high (10%); final 11.8% is outlier not well-justified by evidence |
| S1-4 | o3 | 3% | 15/16 | Most rigorous quantitative base rate derivation with specific historical examples | Slightly concise source analysis |
| S1-5 | o3 | 2.3% | 14/16 | Principled mathematical derivation from reference class | Potentially slightly overconfident at 2.3% |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

The inside view prompt asks each instance to:
- (a) Analyze current sources, evaluate quality, distinguish fact from opinion
- (b) Weight evidence using Strong/Moderate/Weak framework
- (c) State timeframe, describe how prediction changes if halved/doubled
- (d) Justify shift from outside view base rate

Plus complete the calibration checklist.

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Prediction |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model, Sonnet 4.5) | 4% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 3% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 3% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 11.8% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model, o3) | 2.3% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly classifies evidence: Strong against revision (final Code published July 2025, two-year review cycle, no consultation announced, zero sources mention revision); Moderate against (implementation phase focus, Commission focused on separate Article 50 code); Weak (stakeholder criticism, simplification rumors). Explicitly identifies the Article 50 transparency code as a distinct instrument. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 4% -> Output: 3%. Delta = -1pp. Well-justified: the current evidence "reinforces rather than contradicts" the outside view baseline. The slight downward adjustment reflects the complete absence of any positive indicators, but the forecaster correctly notes that going below 3% risks overconfidence. 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses both halved (40 days, ~2%) and doubled (160 days, ~8-10%) scenarios with specific reasoning. Notes EU processes require 4-6 months minimum. 4/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with all 6 elements addressed meaningfully. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated and used. Consistency check present ("3 out of 100 times"). Three key evidence pieces cited with quality assessments. Blind spot identified (major AI safety incident or political crisis). Status quo correctly assessed as "No." 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (downward from 4% to 3%) matches the evidence direction (all negative).
- Final probability of 3% is internally consistent with stated reasoning.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good application of framework. Correctly identifies strong negative evidence (final Code, no consultation, biennial review clause) and weak/neutral evidence (stakeholder concerns, simplification rumors). Specifically identifies the Article 50 Code as distinct. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 3% (from S1-4/o3) -> Output: 3%. Delta = 0pp. The forecaster maintains the outside view baseline, noting current evidence "reinforces rather than contradicts it." This is appropriate given the overwhelmingly negative evidence. Clear reasoning about why the base rate should not change. 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses both halved (40 days, ~1-2%) and doubled (160 days, ~5-7%) scenarios. Notes severe timeline constraints (80 days vs. 4-6 month minimum EU process). 4/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 6 elements addressed. Consistency check present ("3 out of 100 times"). Good blind-spot identification (emergency revision procedures in response to unforeseen events). Status quo correctly assessed as strongly favoring "No." 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Maintaining 3% is internally consistent with the evidence and reasoning.
- Good engagement with the received S1-4 outside view (3%).

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structured analysis using Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Correctly identifies strong negative evidence across multiple dimensions. Notably identifies the separate Article 50 transparency Code as a potential confusion factor. Uses an explicit "net effect" statement: "evidence overwhelmingly supports the status-quo 'No'." 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 3% (from S1-2/Sonnet 4.5) -> Output: 3%. Delta = 0pp. Stays at baseline. Reasoning is clear: no positive signals were found, and the received base rate already incorporates shock scenarios. Appropriate restraint. However, earlier in the inside view, the forecaster presented a 4% outside view base rate before ultimately settling on 3%, which creates minor internal inconsistency. 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses both halved (40 days, ~1-2%) and doubled (160 days, ~5-7%) scenarios with specific reasoning about EU process requirements (internal deliberation, consultation announcement, consultation period, draft preparation totaling 9-18 weeks minimum). 4/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with all elements addressed. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated. Consistency check present. Five key evidence pieces cited. Blind-spot identified (critical legal or technical flaw requiring urgent revision). Status quo correctly assessed. 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Final probability of 3% is consistent with stated reasoning.
- Good identification of why 4% might be "generous" and 2% might risk overconfidence.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses a structured approach but with less granularity than other outputs. Identifies strong evidence (biennial review clause, absence of official signals), moderate evidence (simplification/delay discourse), and weak evidence (Meta/WhatsApp competition enforcement). The distinction between evidence categories is correct but treatment is more concise than optimal. 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 11.8% (from S1-3/GPT-5.2) -> Output: 9%. Delta = -2.8pp. The reduction is modest given that the 11.8% outside view was the ensemble outlier. The forecaster adjusts -5pp for structural signals (biennial review, no announcement) and +2pp for copyright consultation potentially being folded into the Code. The +2pp upward adjustment for the copyright consultation is not well-supported -- multiple sources explicitly state this consultation produces a "list of solutions," not a Code revision. The final 9% remains 3x higher than the other four forecasters, suggesting insufficient correction from the inflated outside view. 2/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses both halved (~40 days) and doubled (~160 days, probability rises to ~15%). The doubled-window estimate of 15% seems high given the strong evidence against revision. Brief but present. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete but concise. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated. Consistency line provided. Key evidence cited (4 items). Blind-spot identified (emergency political deal, could raise to ~30%). Status quo correctly assessed. 3/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The 9% probability is the ensemble outlier. While not unreasonable in isolation, it is not well-justified relative to the overwhelming evidence against revision.
- The +2pp adjustment for copyright consultation being "folded into the Code" is speculative and contradicts the source material.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured evaluation with clear categories. Strong evidence against revision (official "final" label, two-year review cycle, no consultation/press releases). Moderate evidence: legal blogs note unresolved issues (small upward pull), but AI Act enforcement timing may favor stability (downward). Weak evidence: generic "every two years" language leaves theoretical room. Net assessment is decisive: "evidence overwhelmingly supports the status-quo 'No'." 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 2.3% (from S1-5/self) -> Output: 2%. Delta = -0.3pp. Small downward adjustment reflecting the lack of any preparatory signal in seven months. Adds +0.2pp for political pressure, -0.3pp for absence of signals, +0.3pp for unknown-unknowns cushion. Net result is a well-justified small shift. 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but adequate. Notes that if doubled to 160 days, probability would rise only marginally to ~4%. If halved to ~40 days, would drop close to 1%. These are internally consistent with the analysis. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase correct. Base rate used (2.3%). Consistency line present ("2 out of 100 times"). Key evidence cited (4 items). Blind-spot identified (behind-the-scenes political deal, could push to 25%). Status quo assessed as favoring inertia. 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Final 2% is the lowest in the ensemble and represents the most confident "No" position.
- Internally consistent with the extremely strong evidence against revision.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 4% (S1-1) | 3% | -1pp | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 3% (S1-4) | 3% | 0pp | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 3% (S1-2) | 3% | 0pp | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 11.8% (S1-3) | 9% | -2.8pp | 11/16 | Partial (insufficient correction) |
| S2-5 | o3 | 2.3% (S1-5) | 2% | -0.3pp | 14/16 | Yes |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4/o3 at 3%):** Straightforward same-direction case. S1-4 produced a tight 3% that was well-aligned with S2-2's own analysis. S2-2 maintained 3% with no adjustment, engaging meaningfully with the received analysis and correctly affirming its conclusions. Effective but did not test cross-model diversity since the inputs were already aligned.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2/Sonnet 4.5 at 3%):** Good engagement. GPT-5.2 received a well-reasoned 3% base from Sonnet 4.5 and maintained it with thorough independent analysis. The cross-pollination reinforced rather than challenged the conclusion, which is appropriate given the strength of evidence.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3/GPT-5.2 at 11.8%):** This was the most significant cross-pollination test. S2-4 received the ensemble's outlier outside view (11.8%) and adjusted downward only modestly to 9%. While the direction of adjustment was correct, the magnitude was insufficient -- S2-4 should have more aggressively questioned the 11.8% base rate given that the current evidence provided no positive signals for revision. The +2pp adjustment for copyright consultation being potentially folded into the Code was speculative and worked against convergence. Cross-pollination was partially effective but did not fully correct the outlier.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1/Sonnet 4.5, S2-5/o3):** Both produced final probabilities (3%, 2%) that were very close to their received outside views (4%, 2.3%), with small justified adjustments. This shows consistency within model families.

- **Net effect:** Cross-pollination had minimal impact on diversity because 4 of 5 outputs were already tightly clustered. The one case where cross-pollination could have been most valuable (S2-4 correcting the S1-3 outlier) was only partially effective -- S2-4 retained a probability 3x higher than the ensemble median. The final spread (2-9%) is wider than it would have been without the S1-3 -> S2-4 channel. In an ideal scenario, S2-4 would have corrected more aggressively toward the 3% consensus, which would have reduced the final aggregated probability from 4% to approximately 3%.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: a draft document explicitly labeled as a draft or consultation draft of a revised/new version of the GPAI code of practice, published on an official EU AI Office / European Commission page, after Feb 10 and before May 1, 2026.
- All correctly identified the 80-day forecast window.
- All correctly assessed the current status: final Code published July 10, 2025, endorsed August 1, 2025, no revision announced as of February 10, 2026.
- Multiple outputs correctly distinguished the GPAI Code of Practice (Articles 53/55) from the separate Code of Practice on transparency of AI-generated content (Article 50), which does have drafts expected in March 2026. This distinction was critical for avoiding false positive signals.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Final GPAI Code of Practice published July 10, 2025, and endorsed by Commission/AI Board on August 1, 2025
2. Two-year review clause embedded in the Code, suggesting next substantive revision around mid-2027
3. No official announcement, consultation, or indication of a revised GPAI draft as of February 10, 2026
4. Three consultation drafts preceded the final version (November 2024, December 2024, March 2025)
5. Separate Article 50 transparency code has drafts expected in March 2026, but this is a different instrument

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Agent report | Potentially fabricated URLs | Links like "https://code-drafts.ai/GPAI-Code-Second-Draft.pdf" may be hallucinated -- the domain "code-drafts.ai" does not appear to be a known archival site | Low (does not affect forecast reasoning) |
| Agent report | Draft 1 date uncertain | First draft stated as "15 November 2024" but noted as "reconstructed from professional commentary" -- true date may differ | Low (historical accuracy, no impact on forecast) |

### Hallucinations

The Agent report includes some potentially fabricated details (specific URLs like "code-drafts.ai" and the Google Drive link for the first draft), but these are flagged with asterisks and caveats. The factual backbone (three drafts, December 2024 second draft, March 2025 third draft, July 2025 final) is well-corroborated across independent sources. No forecaster outputs contain clear hallucinations -- all key facts are supported by the research.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research execution:** The Agent report produced a comprehensive chronological catalogue of all GPAI Code drafts and explicitly addressed the key question of whether any official sources mention a forthcoming revision. The question URL scraping of the primary resolution source was well-targeted.
2. **Strong analytical consensus:** Four of five forecasters independently converged on 2-4% using different analytical approaches (qualitative reasoning, quantitative base rate calculation, reference class analysis with specific historical EU code examples). This tight consensus on a low-probability outcome reflects genuine analytical alignment.
3. **Critical distinction correctly made:** Multiple forecasters correctly identified that the Article 50 transparency code (with drafts expected March 2026) is a separate instrument from the GPAI Code of Practice. This prevented a potentially significant error.
4. **Rigorous calibration:** Several outputs (especially S1-4/o3 and S1-5/o3) provided explicit quantitative derivations from reference classes with transparent mathematical chains. The calibration checklists in inside views were thorough and meaningful.
5. **Appropriate evidence-to-probability translation:** The ensemble correctly translated the overwhelming negative evidence (no signals of revision) into a very low probability without falling into overconfidence (maintaining 2-4% rather than going below 1%).

### Weaknesses
1. **Outlier insufficiently corrected:** S1-3 (GPT-5.2) produced an 11.8% outside view that was not well-justified by its own evidence analysis, and S2-4 (o3) only reduced this to 9%. The +2pp adjustment for copyright consultation being "folded into the Code" was speculative and contradicted the source material.
2. **AskNews results were poor quality:** 17 articles returned with the overwhelming majority about Meta/WhatsApp antitrust -- zero direct relevance to GPAI Code revision. The deep research query also failed with a 403 error. This wasted context window space in the inside view prompts without adding value.
3. **Limited diversity in reasoning approaches:** While the final probabilities show good convergence, the reasoning paths were quite similar across outputs (all emphasized the same factors: final code status, two-year review cycle, no announcement). More diverse reasoning approaches (e.g., analyzing Commission bandwidth constraints, investigating whether industry lobbying has intensified, examining whether technical standard development could trigger a revision) could have added value.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: A-**

Reasoning: Excellent research quality with a well-executed Agent report that directly addressed the resolution question. Strong ensemble consensus at 2-4% (excluding outlier) with rigorous quantitative reasoning from reference classes. No factual errors affecting the forecast. Correct identification of a key potential confusion point (Article 50 code vs. GPAI Code). The only issues preventing a full A are: (1) the GPT-5.2 outlier at 11.8% that was insufficiently corrected to 9% in the inside view, inflating the final aggregation from approximately 3% to 4%; and (2) poor AskNews result relevance. The final prediction of 4% is well-calibrated for a question where the evidence overwhelmingly points to "No" but some uncertainty should be maintained for unknown unknowns.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- **Improve AskNews query targeting:** The AskNews query was appropriately specific but returned overwhelmingly irrelevant results about Meta/WhatsApp. Consider adding negative keywords or domain filters to exclude antitrust/competition articles when searching for regulatory code revision information.
- **Add EU AI Office RSS/press release monitoring:** For questions about specific EU institutional actions, directly scraping the AI Office press release page or RSS feed would provide the most authoritative and timely signal.
- **Filter irrelevant AskNews results before including in context:** Pre-filtering articles by relevance score could reduce context window waste and prevent forecasters from having to manually dismiss large volumes of irrelevant content.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Add outlier detection in aggregation:** When one forecaster's probability is >3x the median of the ensemble, flag it for review. In this case, S2-4's 9% was 3x the median of 3%, suggesting it should receive reduced weight or trigger a re-evaluation.
- **Consider median or trimmed-mean aggregation for binary questions with outliers:** The mean (4%) is pulled up by the 9% outlier. The median (3%) better represents the ensemble consensus in this case. A trimmed mean (dropping highest and lowest) would also yield 3%.
- **Strengthen cross-pollination correction for outlier inputs:** When a forecaster receives an outside view that diverges significantly from the current evidence base, the inside view prompt could include guidance to more aggressively question the received base rate.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3):** The outside view of 11.8% was the clear outlier. Its source analysis and reference class selection were among the best in the ensemble, but the probability derivation anchored too high (~10%) without sufficient justification from the reference class analysis. The model's stated reference class (EU codes rarely re-enter draft status) supports a much lower probability. May benefit from stronger anchoring guidance to compute explicit base rates before adjusting.
- **o3 (Forecaster 4, S2-4):** When receiving the GPT-5.2 outlier as cross-pollination input, o3 adjusted downward only modestly (11.8% -> 9%). The +2pp adjustment for copyright consultation was speculative and contradicted source material. o3 should more aggressively question received outside views that diverge significantly from the evidence base it independently analyzes.
- **o3 (Forecaster 5):** Excellent performance at 2% with the most principled quantitative derivation. Strong model for low-probability binary questions.
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Consistently strong performance across both stages. Both produced thorough, well-structured analyses with appropriate probability calibration. Best overall model performance in this forecast.
