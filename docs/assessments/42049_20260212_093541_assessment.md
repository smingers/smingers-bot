## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster 5 extraction failure | Critical | S2-5 / Aggregation | Forecaster 5 (o3) produced valid percentiles in its inside view text but extraction failed ("Need at least 2 valid percentile points (got 1)"), reducing the ensemble from 5 to 4 valid CDFs. |
| Massive forecaster spread (5.7× range on medians) | High | Aggregation | Inside-view medians range from ~1,175 (S2-3/GPT-5.2) to ~2,500 (S2-4/o3), a spread that is unusually large for a numeric question with abundant data. |
| GPT-5.2 dramatically lower estimates | High | S1-3, S2-3 | GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3) produced a median of ~1,175 cases, roughly half of what Sonnet 4.5 forecasters predicted, driven by an overly conservative growth model that appears to underweight the current daily case rate of 20+ cases/day. |
| Inconsistent daily rate calculations | Medium | S1-1, S1-2, S1-3, S1-4 | Forecasters calculated different daily rates from the same data (20.4/day from 733 over 36 days vs. ~147/week vs. growth multipliers of 1.4-2.0×), leading to divergent projections despite identical inputs. |
| AskNews deep research failed | Low | Research | AskNews deep research returned a 403 error due to usage limits, though standard AskNews results were sufficient. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (deep research failed) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No (not applicable) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not applicable) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No (not applicable) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. `CDC measles cases 2025 cumulative` (Google)
2. `measles outbreaks 2026 united states` (Google News)
3. `Provide CDC-reported U.S. measles case counts by year 2010-2025 and any reported 2026 cases or outbreaks; include dates of first 2026 reports and sizes` (Agent)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. `CDC measles cases 2026 update` (Google)
2. `US measles outbreak 2026 February` (Google News)
3. `What is the CDC year-to-date count of confirmed U.S. measles cases for 2026 as of February 12 2026, and which states are currently experiencing outbreaks?` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2010-2025 annual totals, 2026 YTD | Feb 2026 latest updates |
| Content type | CDC surveillance data, annual counts, outbreak sizes | Real-time state-level updates, news coverage |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Full historical reference class (16 years), growth dynamics in outbreak years | State-level outbreak status (SC 546-605, NC 18), current weekly accrual rate |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries correctly targeted base rate construction (annual totals 2010-2025) and the Agent report provided an excellent comprehensive synthesis.
- Current queries surfaced the most recent state-level data (SC outbreak still growing at 933 cases, NC at 18, Oregon/Washington emerging).
- The Question URL scrape of the CDC resolution page was highly effective, providing the authoritative 733-case baseline directly.
- The Agent search (2 steps, 5 sub-queries) was thorough and provided the best single research artifact, including early-2026 posting dates and outbreak composition.
- AskNews returned 18 results with strong international context (Mexico 9,074 cases) but deep research failed with a 403 error.
- **Critical gap:** No query targeted intra-year epidemiological curves or CDC weekly epi-curve data that could have provided growth rate trajectories for analogous outbreak years.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs are primarily factual, citing CDC data, state health department figures, and expert commentary. The Agent report is well-structured and avoids making probability estimates, appropriately noting "information gaps identified." Some AskNews articles include expert warnings (Dr. Pavia: "the case for continuous transmission is strong") but these are properly attributed opinions rather than probability forecasts. Research appropriately remains informational.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** CDC official count (733 as of Feb 5), full historical annual series 2010-2025, South Carolina outbreak details (933 state-level cases, 546 in 2026, epicenter in Spartanburg County), vaccination coverage data (92.5% vs. 95% threshold), outbreak composition (92% outbreak-associated, 662 from 2025 chains), Mexico outbreak context (9,074 cases), PAHO April review deadline, early-2026 trajectory (588 on Jan 30 → 733 on Feb 5).
- **Critical information missed:** Intra-year epi curves for analogous outbreak years (2019, 2025) that would have provided more precise growth rate calibration; CDC weekly case count data that could anchor daily accrual rates; R-effective estimates for the SC outbreak.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Strong. Surfaced CDC primary page, NBC, Stanford Medicine expert piece, Asheville Citizen Times, Multnomah County advisory. Good mix of primary and secondary.
  - Agent report: Excellent. Comprehensive 2010-2025 annual data with cross-referenced sources, outbreak sizes, and timeline of early 2026 reporting.
  - AskNews articles: Good. 18 articles provided strong current context including Mexico outbreak data and U.S. News state-by-state breakdown. Deep research failed (403 error).

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough and well-organized. Each source evaluated for quality, recency, and factual vs. opinion content. Correctly identified the CDC page as resolution source. Noted slight discrepancies between sources (2,255 vs. 2,276 for 2025 totals).
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considered four reference classes (2025 continuation, historical high years, post-elimination patterns, active outbreak continuation). Chose the most appropriate: continuation of 2025 dynamics, noting this is "unprecedented territory."
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly calculated 71-day window. Computed daily rate (20.4/day) and compared to 2025 average (6.2/day). Good seasonal analysis (entering peak March-May window).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear scenario-based approach: optimistic (6.2/day → 1,173), moderate (15/day → 1,798), pessimistic (25/day → 2,508). Distribution anchored to these scenarios.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate (P50 ~2,000) derived from continuing but moderating current rate.
- Wide 10th-90th range (1,100-3,200) appropriately reflects outbreak uncertainty.
- Right-skewed distribution consistent with outbreak dynamics.
- Did not anchor on specific data points for intra-year growth patterns.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Nearly identical to S1-1 (same model, same prompt). Correctly identified resolution source and source quality hierarchy.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same four candidates, chose "year-to-date accumulation during active outbreak periods, specifically 2019 and 2025." Slightly less detailed justification than S1-1.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly calculated 71 days. Computed same 20.4/day rate. Good scenario analysis (low 10/day → 1,443; medium 15/day → 1,798; high 25/day → 2,508; very high 30+/day → 2,800+).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Scenario-based, similar to S1-1 but with slightly lower median (~1,825 implied). Wide tails.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate slightly lower than S1-1 (P50 ~1,825).
- Good right-skew with P90 at 2,750.
- Distribution shape appropriate for outbreak uncertainty.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Very thorough—longest and most structured source analysis of all five. Categorized evidence as Strong/Moderate/Weak. Correctly noted the discrepancy between CDC official count (733) and news reports (800+ by Feb 11).
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidates considered. Chose a hybrid approach using spike-year behavior combined with seasonality assumptions. Most conceptually sophisticated reference class analysis.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 10-11 week window. Good discussion of measles generation time (12-14 days) and how 5-6 generations could unfold. Excellent sensitivity analysis (halved/doubled timeframe effects).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Used Fermi-style growth framing (+200 to +500 for low, +800 to +1,500 for moderate, +2,000 to +4,000 for high). Final distribution very wide (P10: 950, P90: 5,000) with heavy right tail.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate ~1,850 (between P40 1,600 and P60 2,100).
- Very wide distribution (P10 950 to P90 5,000 = 5.3× spread) suggests high uncertainty acknowledgment.
- Heavy right tail at 5,000 is justified by discussion of "rare but very large outliers."
- Good shape for outbreak distribution.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but accurate. Each source evaluated in 2-3 sentences. Correctly identified CDC as gold-standard and SC DPH as critical state-level data.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidates: all post-elimination years, large-surge years only, and early-year-to-late-April growth in spike years. Chose the hybrid approach. Used a "multiplier from early-Feb to late-Apr" concept (1.4-2.0× range), which is a novel and useful analytical framing.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 78 days. Excellent breakdown of outbreak containment dynamics: "once recognised, aggressive ring-vaccination and PEP damp growth within 3-6 generations." Quantified new-outbreak probability (~15-20%).
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear component-based approach: SC continuation (+120), smaller chains (+60), new 2026 outbreaks (+70), probability-weighted new large outbreak (0.2 × 400 = 80). Sum: 733 + 330 ≈ 1,060. Lower than other forecasters due to conservative continuation assumptions.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate ~1,100-1,150 (P50). Notably lower than Sonnet 4.5 forecasters.
- P10-P90 range of 800-2,000 is relatively tight for an outbreak question.
- Distribution shape reasonable but may underweight the current 20+ cases/day trajectory.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise, similar to S1-4. Correctly prioritized CDC and state DPH sources. Good cross-checking against known CDC tables.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidates including "large-outbreak continuation years" (2019 and 2025). Excellent use of intra-year growth analysis: 2019 grew from 101 (Feb 8) to 704 (May 3) = 603-case increase; 2025 grew from ~610 (Feb 7) to ~900 (end-Apr) = ~290-case increase. This is the best quantitative reference class analysis.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 72 days. Growth window of 290-600 new cases from historical analogues. Good.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Applied 1.5× multiplier to 733 = ~1,100 median. Component-based: SC continuation (+50 cases/week tapering), two new outbreaks growing, 5-10% chance of runaway scenario.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate ~1,350 (between P40 1,300 and P60 1,600). More conservative than Sonnet 4.5.
- Right-skewed with P90 at 3,000 acknowledging tail risk.
- Best-calibrated use of historical analogues among all forecasters.

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (P50) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~2,000 | 13/16 | Clear scenario-based framework, good rate calculations | No historical analogue growth rates |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~1,825 | 12/16 | Good scenario spectrum | Less detailed than S1-1, similar analysis |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~1,850 | 14/16 | Most sophisticated reference class analysis, Fermi framing | Very wide distribution may reflect excessive uncertainty |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~1,100 | 13/16 | Novel multiplier framework, component-based buildup | May underweight current high daily rate |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~1,350 | 14/16 | Best quantitative use of historical analogues (2019, 2025 intra-year data) | Conservative base rate may not account for 2026's unprecedented early pace |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (P50) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | ~2,000 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~1,100 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~1,825 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ~1,850 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | ~1,350 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied. Correctly identifies three Strong evidence pieces (trajectory exceeds 2025, sustained community transmission, sub-threshold vaccination). Two Moderate (SC trajectory, seasonal timing). Appropriate weighting.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~2,000 → Output: ~2,100, Δ = +100). Modest upward shift justified by acceleration from 588 (Jan 30) to 733 (Feb 5) suggesting stronger momentum than outside view assumed.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis. Halved (35 days to Mar 19): ~1,363. Doubled (142 days to Jul 7): ~2,436. Shows how prediction changes with window.
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed meaningfully. Blind spot identified (aggressive federal/state intervention). Status quo assessment reasonable.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate and uncertainty range updated modestly upward.
- P10-P90 of 1,300-3,000 appropriately tightened from outside view (1,100-3,200).
- Distribution shape consistent with stated reasoning.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent structured analysis. Strong evidence: high early-year starting point (733-800+), SC outbreak continuation, vaccination below threshold, geographic spread to 20-23 states. Moderate: NC declining trend, hospitalization rate change, international pressure, two new outbreaks. Weak: PAHO deadline, media speculation.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~1,100 → Output: ~2,050, Δ = +950). Very large upward shift from the cross-pollinated o3 outside view. Justified by the observation that 800+ cases in 6 weeks already exceeds o3's outside view median of 1,100, making the conservative o3 baseline untenable.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Halved: 900-1,100. Doubled: 1,800-3,000+. Clear progression.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot: rapid coordinated vaccination/quarantine push. Good.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Large upward revision from S1-4's conservative baseline is well-justified.
- Final distribution (P10 1,200, P90 3,800) shows appropriate widening of right tail.
- Correctly identified that o3's outside view was too conservative given current data.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent structured framework. Strong evidence properly identified. Moderate evidence includes NC declining trends and hospitalization rate changes. Weak evidence correctly limited to PAHO deadline and expert speculation.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~1,825 → Output: ~1,175, Δ = -650). **Significant downward shift.** Justified by detailed scenario modeling: SC +120-150 cases, other states +60-80, two new outbreaks +70-100, probability-weighted new large outbreak +45. Total increment from current ~850 baseline: only ~295-375 cases.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved: 900-1,100. Doubled: 1,800-3,000+. Unusual that the doubled-timeframe upper bound exceeds the inside view P90.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot correctly identified (large outbreak in undervaccinated community).

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The downward revision from S1-2's baseline is the most dramatic shift of any forecaster.
- GPT-5.2 appears to model outbreak growth as additive (counting specific case increments) rather than multiplicative, which may underestimate sustained exponential-ish transmission.
- The P10 of 900 implies only +100-150 cases over 78 days—very aggressive control assumption.
- P90 of 2,200 is consistent with one large new outbreak scenario but may underweight compound risk.

- **Score:** 10/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structure. Uses Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Identifies CDC 733 baseline, outbreak structure, and seasonality as strong evidence. Concentration in SC and vaccination gaps as moderate.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~1,850 → Output: ~2,050-2,500, Δ = +200-650). Moderate upward shift with significant widening of right tail (P80 from 3,200 to 3,500, P90 from 5,000 to 6,000).
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Halved: lower by 15-20%. Doubled: upper by ~25%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Four discrete scenarios modeled: rapid control (25%), plateau (35%), continued growth (25%), re-acceleration (15%). Good probabilistic thinking.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate ~2,500 is the highest of all forecasters.
- P90 of 6,000 is very high—would require ~67 cases/day average over remaining 78 days.
- The re-acceleration scenario (15% probability, +6,600 cases) drives the heavy right tail.
- This distribution may overweight tail risk relative to the evidence.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but well-structured. Three evidence tiers. Strong: CDC 733 count, +75%/month January growth, state-level data matching. Moderate: expert consensus on outbreak chains, 2019/2025 analogues, 92.5% vaccination. Weak: media speculation, importation risk.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: ~1,350 → Output: ~1,450, Δ = +100). Very modest upward shift. Used 1.6× multiplier on 733 to project ~1,300-1,600 range, with SC adding 300+ and risk of one further sizeable cluster.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Halved: lower by 10%. Doubled: raise by 25%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot: explosive urban outbreak from spring-break traveler. Good.

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Central estimate ~1,450 is moderate and well-anchored to historical analogues.
- P10-P90 of 900-3,000 is appropriately wide.
- **EXTRACTION FAILED**: Despite valid percentile text output, extraction returned error "Need at least 2 valid percentile points (got 1)." This is a pipeline bug, not a reasoning failure. The CDF was not included in the aggregation.

- **Score:** 13/16 (for reasoning quality; extraction failure is a pipeline issue)

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input (P50) | Final (P50) | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~2,000 | ~2,100 | +100 | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~1,100 | ~2,050 | +950 | 13/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~1,825 | ~1,175 | -650 | 10/16 | Partial |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~1,850 | ~2,500 | +650 | 12/16 | Partial |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~1,350 | ~1,450 | +100 | 13/16 | Yes (EXTRACTION FAILED) |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 ← S1-4/o3):** Excellent engagement. Received o3's conservative P50 of ~1,100 and correctly recognized it was too low given current data (733 cases already in 36 days). Produced a substantial upward revision to ~2,050, demonstrating genuine analytical independence from the cross-pollinated input.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← S1-2/Sonnet 4.5):** Problematic. Received Sonnet's P50 of ~1,825 and dramatically revised *downward* to ~1,175. While GPT-5.2 justified this with component-based case counting, the revision appears to underweight the very evidence that Sonnet correctly identified (20+ cases/day, entering peak season). GPT-5.2 over-relied on its own additive growth model rather than engaging with the cross-pollinated reasoning.

- **S2-4 (o3 ← S1-3/GPT-5.2):** Good engagement. Received GPT-5.2's sophisticated analysis with P50 ~1,850 and maintained the general level while widening the right tail substantially (P90 to 6,000). The four-scenario approach showed genuine independent thinking.

- **S2-1 and S2-5 (self-model pairs):** Both made modest adjustments (+100 each) from their own outside views, which is appropriate and consistent.

- **Net effect on diversity:** Cross-pollination increased diversity slightly. The final spread of medians (1,175 to 2,500) is wider than the outside view spread (1,100 to 2,000). However, this widening was driven more by S2-3's unexpected downward revision and S2-4's upward revision than by constructive engagement with cross-pollinated reasoning.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: CDC cumulative confirmed U.S. measles cases for 2026 as of April 24, 2026, using the CDC page update reflecting April 30 data.
- All correctly identified the forecast timeframe (~71-78 days remaining).
- All correctly assessed the current status: 733 cases as of Feb 5, dominated by SC outbreak.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. 733 confirmed U.S. cases as of Feb 5, 2026 (CDC official)
2. 92% outbreak-associated, with 662 from 2025-origin outbreaks
3. South Carolina as the epicenter with 546-605 cases in 2026 (and 933 total state-level)
4. Vaccination coverage at 92.5%, below the 95% herd immunity threshold
5. 2025 total of 2,276 cases (30-year high)
6. 20 states/jurisdictions reporting cases in 2026

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-3 | Growth rate underestimate | GPT-5.2 estimated only +100-150 cases/month from existing outbreaks, implying ~3-5 cases/day, far below the observed 20.4/day average | High |
| S1-1 | Minor 2025 figure discrepancy | Notes "2,255 cases" from Stanford source vs CDC's 2,276 | Low |
| S2-4 | "outside-view base (post-2000 spike years) produced median ≈ 2,100 cases" | This was not its own outside view median (which was ~1,850) but rather GPT-5.2's | Low |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinated facts, dates, events, or sources were detected. All factual claims trace to the research artifacts. Some forecasters estimated 2019 intra-year growth patterns (e.g., "56% of annual total reported by May 1") that were not directly in the research but are plausible derivations from known CDC data.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research pipeline.** Question URL scraping of the CDC page, Agent report with comprehensive historical data, and AskNews current news all provided strong foundations for forecasting.
2. **Consistent factual grounding.** All five forecasters correctly identified the key data points (733 cases, outbreak composition, vaccination gaps) and resolution criteria.
3. **Good analytical diversity.** Forecasters used meaningfully different approaches: scenario-based (S1-1, S1-2), Fermi-style (S1-3), component-additive (S1-4), and historical-analogue multiplier (S1-5). This is genuine methodological diversity.

### Weaknesses
1. **Forecaster 5 extraction failure** reduced the ensemble from 5 to 4, losing a well-calibrated o3 perspective (~1,450 median with wide tails). This is a pipeline reliability issue.
2. **GPT-5.2's dramatic underestimate** (P50 ~1,175) appears to underweight the current daily case rate. At 20+ cases/day, 78 more days would add ~1,500+ cases even with significant deceleration. The component-based approach (SC +120, others +60, new +70) implies only ~4 cases/day total, inconsistent with observed data.
3. **Wide ensemble spread without convergence.** With excellent shared data (733 cases, known daily rate, outbreak composition), the 2.1× spread between forecaster medians (1,175 to 2,500) suggests the pipeline isn't effectively channeling shared information toward consensus.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

The research pipeline was excellent (A-level), and three of five forecasters produced well-reasoned, well-calibrated distributions. However, the extraction failure on Forecaster 5 and GPT-5.2's unusually low estimate (which pulled the aggregated median down) represent notable weaknesses. The final aggregated distribution is reasonable but would have been stronger with all five forecasters contributing and better convergence on the growth rate implications.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add a query specifically targeting CDC weekly epi-curve data or within-year case accumulation patterns for 2019 and 2025, as this would provide much better growth rate calibration.
- Consider adding a query for R-effective (effective reproduction number) estimates for active outbreaks, which would inform growth rate assumptions directly.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Investigate the extraction failure for Forecaster 5 (o3). The inside-view text contains valid, parseable percentiles (P10: 900, P20: 1050, P40: 1300, P60: 1600, P80: 2200, P90: 3000) but the extraction returned "Need at least 2 valid percentile points (got 1)." The space-separated number formatting in o3 output (e.g., "1 050" instead of "1050") may be causing parsing issues.
- For numeric questions with clear current trajectory data, consider adding a "trajectory sanity check" that compares forecaster growth rate assumptions against observed daily/weekly rates.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **GPT-5.2:** Tends toward overly conservative additive growth models for epidemiological questions. The component-based approach (counting specific increments from each outbreak) may miss the compounding nature of epidemic growth. Consider whether GPT-5.2 would benefit from explicit prompting to check consistency between its bottom-up increment model and top-down growth rate extrapolation.
- **o3:** Good analytical diversity between the two instances. Forecaster 4 was appropriately aggressive with right-tail scenarios, while Forecaster 5 was well-calibrated to historical analogues. The o3 formatting issue (spaces in numbers) should be handled by the extraction logic.
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Consistent, well-reasoned outputs. Both instances produced similar analyses despite different cross-pollination inputs, suggesting strong internal consistency.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (numeric) | Yes | Median range 1,175-2,500 across forecasters; range is 9,412 (588-10,000), spread is 1,325 = 14% of range but very large in absolute terms |
| Update direction errors | Yes | S2-3 revised *downward* from S1-2's ~1,825 to ~1,175, which conflicts with the strong upward trajectory evidence |
| Factual errors present | No | |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | S2-2 demonstrated excellent cross-model engagement; S2-3 appeared to override its input |
| Critical info missed in research | No | Research was comprehensive; intra-year epi curves would have been helpful but not critical |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All calculations internally consistent, though approaches diverge |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | S2-3 (GPT-5.2, P50 ~1,175) and S2-4 (o3, P50 ~2,500) are both outliers relative to the ensemble mean of ~1,956 |
