## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster 4 (o3) failed percentile extraction | High | S2-4 | o3 produced a complete inside view analysis with explicit percentile values but formatted them without the required "Percentile X:" prefix, causing extraction failure. This dropped the ensemble from 5 to 4 valid CDFs, removing one o3 perspective and reducing model diversity. |
| AskNews returned many irrelevant articles | Medium | Research | Of 22 AskNews articles, roughly half were irrelevant to the question: Italian judicial reform referendum, UK apprenticeship reforms, Labour housing policy details, etc. These consumed summarization budget without informing the forecast. |
| AskNews deep research hit rate limit | Low | Research | Deep research failed with 403 usage-limit error. Standard AskNews still returned 22 articles, so impact was limited. |
| Inconsistent MP count across sources | Low | Research | Some sources report 7 MPs (AOL/AskNews Feb 8), others 8 (BBC Jan 26, question background). The discrepancy reflects timing (pre/post Braverman) but could confuse forecasters. All forecasters correctly anchored on 8. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical only) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (current; deep research failed 403) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No (not applicable) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not applicable) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | N/A (numeric question) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | No URLs scraped |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. `Conservative MPs considering Reform UK` (Google) -- 3 results
2. `potential defections to Reform UK` (Google News) -- 3 results
3. `List of MPs who defected to UKIP, Brexit Party or Reform UK since 2010 and any public statements since Jan 2026 by Conservative MPs praising Farage or hinting at defection` (Agent) -- 2 steps, 5 sub-queries, 1 comprehensive report

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. `Reform UK MPs February 2026` (Google) -- 3 results
2. `Conservative defect Reform UK 2026` (Google News) -- 3 results
3. `Summarize UK press coverage since Jan 2026 on MPs likely to defect to Reform UK before May 7 2026` (AskNews) -- 22 articles

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Historical defection patterns 2010-2026, named potential defectors | Feb 2026 political landscape, Labour crisis, by-election |
| Content type | Defection lists, Tory MP public statements, party dynamics | News articles, campaign coverage, political commentary |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Historical defection rates (UKIP: 2, Brexit: 0, Reform: 5 sitting MPs); named potential defectors (Hayes, Francois, McVey, Brandon Lewis) | Labour crisis (McSweeney resignation), Gorton & Denton by-election, shadow cabinet formation, local election postponements |

**Analysis:**
Good separation between historical and current queries. Historical queries correctly targeted base rate establishment -- the agent report was particularly valuable, producing a comprehensive chronological list of defections and identifying Conservative MPs who publicly signaled sympathy with Reform. Current queries captured the evolving political environment well, though AskNews returned many irrelevant articles (Italian referendum, apprenticeships, housing policy). The key gap: no query specifically targeted the Gorton & Denton by-election odds, which emerged as a relevant +1 MP pathway only through incidental coverage. Question URL scraping was not used (no resolution URL provided in question metadata).

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The agent report remained appropriately factual -- it listed defections and public statements without offering probability estimates. AskNews article summaries similarly stayed descriptive. No research outputs inappropriately included forecasts.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Current MP count (8) confirmed by multiple sources
  - May 7 deadline explicitly confirmed (Farage quotes, BBC)
  - Historical defection rates (UKIP 2, Brexit Party 0 sitting MPs, Reform 5 to date)
  - Named potential defectors (Brandon Lewis, Mark Francois, Esther McVey, Sir John Hayes, Katie Lam)
  - Farage's strict conditions for defectors ("not a rescue charity")
  - 17% of Reform supporters view defections negatively (YouGov/QMUL)
  - Gorton & Denton by-election on Feb 26 with Reform candidate

- **Critical information missed:**
  - No specific polling on individual potential defectors' likelihood of switching
  - No UK Parliament membership records or whip status changes since late January
  - No quantitative analysis of by-election winning probability for Reform in Gorton & Denton

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: High quality (BBC, Guardian, QMUL academic piece). Well-chosen sources with clear factual reporting.
  - Agent report: Very good. Comprehensive historical synthesis with proper source attribution. Correctly identified both confirmed defectors and those publicly hinting at switching.
  - AskNews articles: Mixed. Perhaps 10-12 of 22 articles were relevant. The Sun and AOL pieces on shadow cabinet were useful; articles on Italian referendums, apprenticeship schemes, and housing policy were noise.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough. Evaluates all 6 sources individually, correctly distinguishes factual reporting (BBC, AOL) from opinion (QMUL analysis). Notes that GB News piece is tangential. Correctly identifies the key timeline discrepancy (7 vs 8 MPs).
- **Reference Class Selection:** Good. Proposes 3 reference classes: (1) UKIP 2014-15 defections (2 MPs), (2) Reform defection pattern Sept 2025-Jan 2026, (3) historical third-party MP ceilings. Chooses (2) combined with (3) as most suitable. Reasonable.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 88-day window. Identifies January cluster pattern. Discusses deadline effect on fence-sitters. Notes diminishing returns after initial surge.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derives expected 2-4 additional defections (10-12 total) with clear reasoning. Acknowledges downside (8, status quo) and upside (15-18, unprecedented wave). Slightly wide P90 at 15.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Good systematic coverage. Evaluates each source with quality rating. Correctly notes the "around 20" figure refers to former MPs, not sitting MPs.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes: UKIP defections 2014-15, Reform defections 2024-26, SDP 1981-82. Chooses Reform recent pattern as most applicable. Sound reasoning.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 88-day window. Calculates crude rate (1 new MP per ~30 days) then correctly notes hazard decay. Good analytical approach.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Base rate calculation leads to "a couple more" with mean 10-11. Reasonable. Distribution is slightly tighter than S1-1 with P90 at 13.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** The most thorough of the five. Explicitly structures as "bottom line from sources" synthesis. Labels items as factual vs opinion vs interpretation. Clear delineation of what each source offers.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Proposes 3 classes including Change UK/Independent Group 2019 (which other forecasters didn't consider). Useful for upper tail reasoning. Creates hybrid class combining modern defection episodes. Creative and well-justified.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 88-day window. Good analysis of what triggers defection waves (triggering event, credible destination, coordination). Notes deadline can pull decisions forward.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Arrives at +1 to +4 net MPs with fat-tail allowance. Uses broader uncertainty range than Sonnet instances. P90 at 16 reflects the Change UK/SDP tail risk reasoning.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but complete. Brief treatment of each source, correctly identifies factual reliability levels. Less detailed than GPT-5.2 or Sonnet outputs.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses "defections to Reform UK in this parliament to date" as primary class. Reasonable but doesn't explore alternatives as thoroughly.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 88 days. Calculates average defection rate (1 per ~30 days). Notes hazard decay. Includes quantitative estimate for death/ill-health risk (~5-7% of one loss in 3 months) -- a nice touch other forecasters missed.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Mean of "a couple more," modal 10-11. Wide tails (P10=7, P90=15). The P10=7 is the only output to model downside below 8, reflecting the health/resignation risk. Good calibration.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Brief but adequate. Rates each source and notes reliability levels. Less detail than other outputs.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Proposes 3 classes including right-populist UK parties since 2010. Correctly notes Reform already at 8 exceeds all historical precedent, suggesting limited further upside reference. Good insight.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 88 days. Notes most defections occur in clusters after high-profile first mover. Brief but accurate.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Conservative estimate -- 50% chance of 0-1 more, 35% of 2-3, 15% of 4+. This is more conservative than other forecasters, producing lower P60 (10) and P90 (13). Reasonable given the "already beyond precedent" observation.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (P10/P50/P90) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|--------------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 8 / ~10 / 15 | 14/16 | Thorough source analysis, balanced bull/bear case | P90=15 possibly too wide for 88 days |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 8 / ~9-10 / 13 | 13/16 | Good hazard decay reasoning, quantitative rate calc | Slightly less creative reference class analysis |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 7 / ~9-10 / 16 | 15/16 | Best source analysis, creative reference classes (Change UK), well-structured | Widest P90 at 16, driven by SDP/Change UK tail logic |
| S1-4 | o3 | 7 / ~10 / 15 | 13/16 | Unique downside modeling (health/resignation risk), quantitative hazard estimate | Briefer analysis, fewer reference classes explored |
| S1-5 | o3 | 7 / ~9 / 13 | 12/16 | Good insight that 8 MPs already exceeds all precedent | Most conservative, may underweight deadline urgency |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Median Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self, Sonnet 4.5) | ~10 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~10 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~9-10 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ~9-10 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self, o3) | ~9 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Thorough application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly categorizes May 7 deadline and current MP count as strong evidence; January surge and identified defectors as moderate; polling plateau and "Labour figure" rumor as weak. Clear and well-organized.
- **Update from Base Rate:** S1-1 median ~10 → S2-1 median 10. Essentially no update at the center, but modestly compressed tails (P90: 15→14). Justified: inside view evidence balanced upside (deadline urgency) against downside (Farage selectivity, brand dilution).
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Explicitly discusses halved (44 days: fewer defections) and doubled (176 days: more, but deadline nullifies). Shows understanding of deadline dynamics.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. All 7 items addressed. Blind spot identified (major Tory crisis could trigger second wave). Status quo anchor maintained at P10=8. Consistency check performed.

**Numeric-specific assessment:** Distribution shape appropriate -- right-skewed from 8, tails reasonable. P10=8 (status quo) is well-justified. P90=14 is a slight compression from S1-1's 15, reflecting Farage's selectivity evidence. CDF should be monotonic.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Identifies 8 MPs as strong anchor, May 7 cutoff and recent acceleration as strong, by-election as moderate, shadow cabinet as weak. Appropriate categorization.
- **Update from Base Rate:** S1-4 median ~10 → S2-2 median 10. Similar to S2-1: center unchanged, upper tail widened (P90: 15→15, P80: 13→13). Explicitly discusses by-election as "+1 seat" channel -- good.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Halved/doubled analysis with specific MP shifts. Notes deadline eliminates extended-window scenario.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot = sudden mass Conservative collapse. Status quo anchor at P10=8.

**Numeric-specific assessment:** Slightly wider distribution than S2-1 (P90=15 vs 14). The by-election pathway justification for wider upper tail is reasonable. Distribution appropriately right-skewed.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Structured hierarchically. Identifies by-election as a "concrete seat-gain channel" that outside view may underweight -- the most explicit treatment of this pathway across all forecasters. Good.
- **Update from Base Rate:** S1-2 median ~9-10 → S2-3 median 11-12. Upward shift of ~2 MPs, the largest update of any forecaster. Justified by: (1) by-election adding discrete +1 possibility, (2) volatile environment (Brookings), (3) shadow cabinet moves signaling active recruitment. However, magnitude may be slightly excessive.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Adequate. Discusses halved/doubled scenarios with quantified shifts.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Includes quantitative scenario: "trend-continued" 11-13, "no growth" 8-9, "higher growth" 14-16. Good scenario structuring.

**Numeric-specific assessment:** The most bullish distribution: P40=11, P60=12, P80=14, P90=16. The +2 upward shift from outside view is the largest and arguably overweights the by-election possibility (Reform is competitive but not the favorite in Gorton & Denton). The P90=16 implies 8+ additional MPs in 88 days, which would require nearly all identified potential defectors plus a by-election win -- ambitious.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 -- **EXTRACTION FAILED**

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Uses 7-item evidence list with temporal ordering. Identifies confirmed facts vs speculative rumors.
- **Update from Base Rate:** S1-3 median ~9-10 → S2-4 intended median ~11. Moderate upward shift driven by defection momentum and by-election opportunity. Quantitative: expected defections mean 2.5, by-election +0.3, attrition -0.1, total +2.7 → 10.7 median. Very precise.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but adequate.
- **Calibration Checklist:** All items present.

**However:** Despite producing complete analysis and explicit percentile values (P10: 8, P20: 9, P40: 10, P60: 11, P80: 13, P90: 16), the extraction failed because the output format used "Percentile 10: 8 MPs" with the "MPs" unit suffix (or similar formatting issue) rather than the expected format. The error message shows the extractor couldn't find valid percentiles in the final 300 characters.

**Impact:** This removed one of two o3 perspectives from the ensemble, reducing model diversity. The lost CDF was moderate -- not an outlier -- so the aggregate was not drastically distorted, but the ensemble was weakened from 5 to 4 CDFs.

- **Score:** 13/16 (for the analysis quality; extraction failure is a pipeline issue, not a reasoning issue)

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise. Strong evidence: cutoff date, current count. Moderate: Conservative turmoil, Gorton & Denton. Weak: partisan rumours, bookmaker speculation. Appropriately skeptical.
- **Update from Base Rate:** S1-5 median ~9 → S2-5 median 9. Essentially no update. Calculates +1 MP net adjustment from status quo, nudging median to 9. This is the most conservative inside view.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Very brief (one sentence on halved/doubled). Adequate but minimal.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present but compact. Blind spot identified. All items addressed.

**Numeric-specific assessment:** Most conservative distribution (P60=10, P90=13). The lack of meaningful update from outside view suggests S2-5 didn't find compelling new evidence to shift. This is defensible -- the current search largely confirmed what the historical search found -- but may underweight the by-election pathway and deadline urgency.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final Median | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (~10) | 10 | 0 | 14/16 | Yes (stable center, compressed tails) |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (~10) | 10 | 0 | 13/16 | Yes (slight tail widening for by-election) |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (~9-10) | 11-12 | +2 | 12/16 | Partial (direction right, magnitude high) |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (~9-10) | FAILED | -- | 13/16 | N/A (extraction failure) |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (~9) | 9 | 0 | 11/16 | Partial (conservative, may underweight deadline) |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 ← S1-4 o3):** Engaged meaningfully with the o3 outside view. S1-4 included the health/resignation downside risk (P10=7); S2-2 raised this back to P10=8, reasoning that zero additional defections was more likely than a net loss. Reasonable adjustment. The o3 input's wider tails (P90=15) were preserved in S2-2's output (P90=15). Good engagement.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← S1-2 Sonnet 4.5):** Received a moderate Sonnet outside view (P90=13) but significantly widened the upper tail to P90=16. The by-election pathway was the main justification for this divergence. The cross-pollination here was productive in that GPT-5.2 added new analytical dimensions (explicit scenario structuring) rather than simply inheriting the Sonnet distribution.

- **S2-4 (o3 ← S1-3 GPT-5.2):** Received GPT-5.2's creative reference class analysis (Change UK, SDP) and the widest outside view (P90=16). The o3 inside view output showed some engagement with these tail scenarios but ultimately produced a moderate P90=16 (matching the input). However, extraction failed.

- **S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5 ← S1-1 self):** Self-model pollination. Compressed tails from P90=15 to 14 based on inside view evidence. Modest but appropriate self-correction.

- **S2-5 (o3 ← S1-5 self):** Self-model pollination. Essentially no update (both centered on median 9). The conservative outside view was reinforced rather than challenged.

**Overall:** Cross-pollination was moderately effective. The cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3) produced meaningfully different distributions from the self-model instances (S2-1, S2-5). S2-3's by-election analysis was genuinely additive. However, the loss of S2-4 reduced the value of the cross-pollination structure since it eliminated the o3-receives-GPT-5.2 pathway.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (count of Reform UK MPs on May 7, 2026)
- All correctly identified the 88-day forecast window
- All correctly anchored on 8 MPs as current count
- The discrete nature of the question (integer outcomes) was well-handled -- all percentile values were whole numbers or near-whole numbers

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Reform UK currently has 8 MPs (post-Braverman defection)
2. Farage set May 7, 2026 as explicit deadline for accepting defectors
3. 3 Conservative MPs defected in 11 days (Jan 16-26, 2026)
4. Farage imposed strict conditions ("not a rescue charity")
5. Gorton & Denton by-election on Feb 26 could produce a +1 MP pathway

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1 | Timeline counting issue | Lists Lee Anderson as defection bringing count to seat 6, but Anderson won his seat at the 2024 election as Reform, not via defection from Conservatives | Low -- doesn't affect final count or prediction |
| S2-3 | By-election overweighting | Treats Gorton & Denton by-election win as a significant probability when most reporting suggests it's a four-way race with Reform competitive but not the favorite | Medium -- contributes to higher P90 |
| Multiple | "~20 former MPs" conflation | Some outputs occasionally blur "20 former Conservative MPs" (who lost seats/retired) with "potential defecting sitting MPs," which are two different pools | Low -- all correctly compute from base of 8 sitting MPs |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. All factual claims traceable to research sources. Named potential defectors (Brandon Lewis, Mark Francois, etc.) all appear in the research materials.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong ensemble convergence on central estimate:** All four valid forecasters agreed on a median of 9-12 MPs, with most centered at 10-11. This represents a reasonable +2-3 defections from the current 8, consistent with available evidence.
2. **Excellent research quality:** The agent report was one of the strongest seen -- comprehensive historical defection timeline, named potential defectors with specific dates and source attribution. Historical/current query separation was well-executed.
3. **Good calibration reasoning:** Multiple forecasters engaged with the right analytical questions: deadline effects, pool depletion, Farage's selectivity vs defection urgency. The quantitative hazard estimates (S1-4's health/resignation risk, S2-4's expected defection mean of 2.5) showed genuine calibration effort.
4. **Appropriate right-skew:** All distributions correctly modeled the asymmetry -- downside bounded by status quo (8), upside open for defection waves. This matches the structural reality of the question.

### Weaknesses
1. **Extraction failure cost the ensemble one o3 perspective.** Forecaster 4 produced substantive analysis with the most precise quantitative framework (mean defections 2.5, by-election +0.3, attrition -0.1) but was lost to a formatting issue. This is a pipeline robustness problem.
2. **GPT-5.2 consistently the most bullish without strong justification for the gap.** S2-3's P90=16 implies 8+ additional MPs -- nearly all identified potential defectors plus a by-election win. The by-election rationale is reasonable but the magnitude of the upward shift (+2 from outside view) may overweight a single competitive race.
3. **Limited engagement with downside scenarios.** Only S1-4 (o3) modeled the possibility of falling below 8 MPs (health, resignation, whip withdrawal). Given an 88-day window with 8 MPs, the probability of at least one loss event is non-trivial (~5-10%).

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The research was excellent and the reasoning across all forecasters was solid. The central estimate of median ~10 MPs (2-3 additional defections) is well-calibrated given the evidence. The main deductions are for losing one forecaster to extraction failure (pipeline issue, not reasoning), and the somewhat fat P90 driven by GPT-5.2's bullish outlier. The forecast appropriately captured the key dynamics: deadline urgency, pool depletion, Farage's selectivity, and the by-election pathway.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Query specifically for by-election odds/polling where a by-election is a relevant +1 pathway. The Gorton & Denton race was picked up incidentally but deserved a targeted query.
- For political defection questions, query UK Parliament membership records directly for the most recent whip status data.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Extraction robustness:** Forecaster 4's extraction failure was caused by formatting. The extractor should be more tolerant of unit suffixes ("8 MPs" vs "8") and varied formatting patterns.
- Consider adding a discrete-specific prompt variant for questions with integer outcomes and small ranges (0-30), since the standard numeric CDF approach with 201 points may be overkill for what is effectively a PMF question.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **GPT-5.2:** Strongest source analysis and creative reference class selection, but consistently the most bullish forecaster. The by-election pathway reasoning was good but the +2 shift from outside view was aggressive. Consider whether GPT-5.2's inside view updates tend to systematically overweight novel information.
- **o3 (Forecaster 5):** Most conservative, with minimal update from outside to inside view. May benefit from more explicit instruction to engage with new evidence channels (like by-elections) rather than simply confirming the outside view.
- **o3 (Forecaster 4):** Best quantitative framework (explicit expected value calculation) but lost to extraction. Fix the extraction pipeline to capture this output.
