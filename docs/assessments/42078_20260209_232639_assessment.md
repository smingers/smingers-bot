# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Missing S1-3 outside view output | High | S1-3 / Pipeline | `forecaster_3_outside_view.md` does not exist. GPT-5.2 produced no outside view, yet its inside view (S2-3) still ran using S1-2's output per the cross-pollination map. The pipeline silently continued without logging an error. |
| S1-4 inflated base rate from overly broad reference class | High | S1-4 | Used a global reference class of ~10 authoritarian shutdowns (including Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, Uganda) and derived a 60% base rate of reversion within 3 months, producing a 55% outside view. This class included quick restorations that are structurally dissimilar to Iran's whitelist architecture deployment. |
| S2-3 zero update from outside view | Medium | S2-3 | GPT-5.2 received S1-2's 6% outside view and produced an identical 6% inside view with zero adjustment, despite substantial new evidence in the current search results (Filterwatch permanent plan, Wired surveillance article, government statements). |
| S2-4 ambiguous base rate sourcing | Medium | S2-4 | o3 references a 55% outside view base rate that matches S1-4's output. Per the cross-pollination map, S2-4 should receive S1-3, but S1-3 does not exist. The pipeline likely fell back to S1-4 or another source, but this is not documented. |
| Residual anchoring on inflated S1-4 in S2-2 and S2-4 | Low | S2-2, S2-4 | Despite large corrections (55% down to 28% and 25% respectively), both outputs that received the inflated S1-4 base rate remain 10-17pp above the ensemble median of the other three forecasters (~8.7%), suggesting incomplete correction. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes (both) |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical only) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (current; deep research failed with 403) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | N/A (binary question) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Not documented |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. `Iran internet whitelist lifting NetBlocks` (Google)
2. `Iran internet shutdown 2026 heavy filtering` (Google News)
3. `Search NetBlocks reports on Iran 2019 and 2022 protests, durations until filtering ended, and any instances where NetBlocks said internet "returned to normal" after whitelisting periods. Also collect official Iranian statements on restoration timelines.` (Agent)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. `NetBlocks Iran whitelist February 2026` (Google)
2. `Iran internet filtered NetBlocks 2026` (Google News)
3. `What is the current status of Iran's internet filtering and whitelisting according to NetBlocks reports since early February 2026? Focus on access levels for most users in Iran.` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2019 and 2022 shutdown precedents, long-run patterns | Feb 2026 status, latest NetBlocks reports |
| Content type | Historical base-rate data, NetBlocks language patterns | News articles, expert assessments, government statements |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Established that NetBlocks has NEVER declared Iran internet "returned to normal" | Confirmed ongoing whitelist status, Filterwatch permanent plan, economic damage |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are well-differentiated and appropriately targeted. Historical queries focused on establishing base rates from prior shutdowns, while current queries targeted the latest NetBlocks assessments.
- The Agent query was ambitious and highly relevant, asking specifically about NetBlocks language patterns across 2019 and 2022. It delivered an excellent report establishing that NetBlocks has never declared Iran's internet "returned to normal" -- a critical finding for resolution criteria interpretation.
- The AskNews query was well-targeted to the resolution authority (NetBlocks) and returned 17+ articles providing comprehensive coverage of the current situation.
- No critical information gaps are apparent. The research successfully surfaced all key facts: current filtering status, historical precedents, expert assessments, government statements, and structural infrastructure changes.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs were appropriately factual. The Agent report stayed procedural, documenting historical facts and NetBlocks language patterns without offering probability estimates. AskNews articles quoted expert assessments (Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani) which included directional opinions ("usually we don't go back to normal") but these are expert judgments relevant to the question, not research-generated forecasts. Google results were factual news reporting. Overall, research properly informed without forecasting.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - NetBlocks has NEVER declared Iranian internet "returned to normal" after any shutdown (critical for resolution criteria)
  - NetBlocks reports (Jan 27-Feb 9): "heavily filtered on a whitelist basis" consistently
  - 2019 shutdown: ~5 day blackout, restored by Nov 27, but filtering never fully ended
  - 2022 shutdown: Instagram/WhatsApp blocks remained indefinitely, never restored
  - Government commitment: restrictions until "at least" March 20 (Nowruz)
  - Expert consensus: Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani all predict non-restoration
  - Filterwatch: classified plan for permanent whitelist system
  - Economic damage: $35M/day losses, $196M total per Ministry of Communications
  - 3,117-5,925 confirmed deaths -- "bloodiest crackdown since 1979"
  - Chinese-exported DPI middlebox technology enabling whitelist architecture
- **Critical information missed:**
  - None significant. The research was comprehensive for this question type.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: High quality. AP News, RFE/RL, The National, CNN, Guardian, BBC all provided well-sourced factual reporting with named experts.
  - Agent report: Excellent. Delivered the single most important finding: NetBlocks has never used "returned to normal" language for Iran. Thoroughly documented 2019 and 2022 timelines with specific dates and sources.
  - AskNews articles: Good volume (17+ articles) with strong international coverage. Multiple Filterwatch-sourced articles on permanent whitelist plans. Some redundancy across languages but each added regional perspective.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all sources. Correctly rates AP News, RFE/RL, CNN, Guardian, BBC as high quality. Flags Iran International as "exile-based, less reliable." Distinguishes factual NetBlocks measurements from expert opinions. Identifies the Agent report's critical finding about NetBlocks language patterns. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three relevant reference classes: (1) Iranian internet shutdowns, (2) authoritarian internet restrictions during major protests, (3) government promises vs. actual restoration. Selects Iranian shutdown patterns as most suitable, combined with government statements. Good justification. 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 81-day window. Provides detailed comparison: 2019 = 11 days acute, 2022 = months with no clear restoration. Notes current shutdown already 3x longer than 2019. Identifies critical difference: government commitment through March 20. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts with 50% base rate from 1/2 Iranian cases (2019 yes, 2022 no), adjusts to 30% for severity, then to 20% for NetBlocks language patterns. The 50% starting point from N=2 is reasonable but the claim that 2019 "restored" is debatable given NetBlocks never declared normalization. The adjustments are directionally correct and well-reasoned. 3/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Derived 20% probability with clear pathway analysis for both Yes and No outcomes.
- Correctly identified the resolution criteria as requiring NetBlocks to specifically report NOT "heavily filtered/whitelisted" -- a high bar.
- Good sensitivity analysis noting the 39-day government commitment consuming 48% of the prediction window.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Very thorough. Evaluates every source with quality assessments. Correctly identifies expert sources by name and affiliation. Distinguishes NetBlocks technical measurements from opinions. Notes Agent report's critical finding about NetBlocks never declaring "returned to normal." 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same three classes as S1-1 but with sharper focus on the current 2026 trajectory as the most relevant reference. Correctly weights toward expert assessments from NetBlocks as the resolution source. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 81 days. Provides detailed timeline breakdown: 39 days of government-committed restrictions, then 42 days for potential restoration. Notes current shutdown already 3x longer than 2019 acute phase. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses mathematical decomposition: P(government restores by March 20) x P(restoration is NOT heavily filtered) x P(NetBlocks confirms) = 0.40 x 0.15 x 0.80 = 4.8%, plus alternative earlier scenario adding 0.8%, totaling ~5-6%. This is the most rigorous mathematical approach in the ensemble. Each conditional probability is explicitly justified. 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The multi-step probability decomposition is methodologically excellent.
- Correctly identifies the high evidentiary bar: NetBlocks must affirmatively declare "not heavily filtered."
- Final 6% is well-calibrated given the conditional probabilities.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** N/A -- output does not exist.
- **Reference Class Selection:** N/A
- **Timeframe Analysis:** N/A
- **Base Rate Derivation:** N/A

**Note:** `forecaster_3_outside_view.md` is missing from the artifacts. The pipeline continued without this output. This represents a significant pipeline failure that was not logged in `metadata.json` (which shows 0 errors).

- **Score:** N/A (pipeline failure)

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Covers all sources with quality ratings. Correctly distinguishes factual AP News reporting from less reliable Iran International. Identifies Agent report as useful for base-rate construction. Separates data from opinion. 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three candidate classes: (1) Iran-only shutdowns (N=2), (2) global authoritarian protest-driven shutdowns (N~10), (3) whitelist architecture rollouts. Selects Class 2 for better sample size. However, the class includes structurally dissimilar cases: Kazakhstan 2022 (3-day shutdown, quick restoration), Sri Lanka 2022, Uganda 2021 -- these were short shutdowns without whitelist infrastructure deployment, fundamentally different from Iran's current situation. The 60% base rate derived from this class is inflated because it treats Iran's whitelist implementation as comparable to brief political shutdowns elsewhere. 2/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 82 days. Notes median duration of heavy filtering in reference class is 2-4 weeks, and 70% of reversions happened within 8 weeks. However, this analysis contradicts the current situation where Iran is already beyond 4 weeks with no improvement. The analysis partially acknowledges this ("being >4 weeks into the shutdown slightly lowers the prior") but understates the significance. 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Derives 60% from global reference class, adjusts -5pp for Iranian severity to 55%. The 60% starting point is problematic because the reference class over-weights quick restorations in countries without whitelist infrastructure. The -5pp adjustment is too small given the structural differences. The final 55% is the highest in the ensemble by a wide margin (35pp above the next highest S1-1 at 20%). 2/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- At 55%, this outside view implies Iran is more likely than not to lift heavy filtering before May -- a position contradicted by every expert quoted in the research, by NetBlocks' current assessments, and by the government's own statements.
- The reference class selection drives the entire overestimate. Iran's whitelist architecture deployment is structurally different from Kazakhstan or Uganda's brief political shutdowns.

- **Score:** 10/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Evaluates all sources concisely with quality distinctions. Correctly identifies NetBlocks posts as "primary, near-real-time network measurement organization; high credibility." Notes Agent report as "credible because it links to verifiable primary tweets and articles." Good separation of international outlets' factual reporting from expert opinions. 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three candidate classes: (1) Iran-only shutdowns (N=2), (2) global authoritarian shutdowns (N~10), (3) whitelist architecture rollouts. Correctly selects Class 1 (Iran-only) with clear justification for why it's most relevant despite small sample. Uses Beta(1,9) shrinkage to handle small-sample uncertainty. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly states 81 days. Notes that previous Iranian shutdowns never returned to pre-crackdown openness. Provides halved/doubled timeframe sensitivity: ~5% if halved, ~12-15% if doubled. Good analysis of why even extended timeframes are insufficient given regime's "permanent" stated plan. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts with 0/2 historical base rate, applies Beta(1,9) shrinkage to account for tail possibilities and sample size, arriving at ~9%. This is mathematically principled: Bayesian shrinkage from 0% toward a reasonable prior (10%) weighted by evidence. Clearly explains the reasoning and acknowledges uncertainty. The reference to "authoritarian policy reversals within short horizons ~5-10%" as the shrinkage target is well-chosen. 3/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- At 9%, this outside view is well-calibrated against the evidence.
- Correctly identifies that the 0/2 base rate needs upward adjustment for small-sample uncertainty.
- Good sensitivity analysis across timeframes.

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 20% | 14/16 | Thorough source analysis, well-structured pathway analysis | Starting 50% base rate from N=2 is debatable; 2019 "restoration" mischaracterized |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 6% | 16/16 | Best mathematical decomposition with conditional probabilities | None significant |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Missing entirely -- pipeline failure |
| S1-4 | o3 | 55% | 10/16 | Acknowledged short horizon | Overly broad reference class inflated base rate by ~35pp |
| S1-5 | o3 | 9% | 14/16 | Principled Beta shrinkage, good timeframe sensitivity | Minor: could have engaged more with structural whitelist evidence |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 20% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 55% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 6% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | N/A (missing; likely received S1-4's 55% based on output text) |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 9% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent application of Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong evidence: NetBlocks continuous reports (Jan 27-Feb 9), expert consensus on non-restoration, government commitment through March 20, structural whitelist implementation. Moderate evidence: economic pressure ($35M/day), duration exceeds 2019 precedent, international pressure. Weak evidence: partial connectivity improvements, regime internal uncertainty. Each category includes specific quantification of impact. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 20% -> Output: 12%, Delta = -8pp. Well-justified factor-by-factor decomposition: NetBlocks language pattern (-5%), government timeline (-3%), structural whitelist (-2%), expert unanimity (-1%), severity (-1%), economic pressure (+2%), remaining time (+2%). Each adjustment is explicitly reasoned. Direction and magnitude both appropriate. 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Detailed analysis. If halved (~40 days): 5-8%, falling entirely within government commitment period. If doubled (~162 days): 35-40%, still constrained by structural whitelist implementation and NetBlocks language patterns. Good reasoning about why remaining 42 days after Nowruz is the effective window. 4/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 6 elements completed meaningfully. Paraphrase correct. Base rate (20%) stated. Consistency check: "12 out of 100 times" -- articulated clearly. Top evidence: 3 items, all factually verified. Blind spot: regime collapse/transition. Status quo: correctly identifies continuation as most likely. 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (downward from 20%) matches evidence direction (all evidence points to continued filtering).
- Final 12% is internally consistent with stated reasoning -- primarily driven by the finding that NetBlocks has never declared Iranian internet "not heavily filtered."
- Good alternative framing: "88% probability internet remains heavily filtered/whitelisted through May 1."

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good application of framework. Correctly identifies same key evidence categories as S2-1. Distinguishes structural changes (permanent architecture) from temporary measures. Notes economic tolerance has exceeded historical thresholds. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 55% -> Output: 28%, Delta = -27pp. This is a large and directionally correct correction. Factor decomposition: duration anomaly (-10pp), expert consensus on permanent architecture (-10pp), regime statements (-5pp), economic tolerance exceeded (-5pp), time remaining (+5pp), technical challenges (+3pp). However, the final 28% remains higher than the three forecasters not anchored on S1-4's inflated base (S2-1: 12%, S2-3: 6%, S2-5: 8%), suggesting residual anchoring on the 55% starting point. 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis. If halved: ~30-35%. If doubled: ~45-50%. Notes March 20 (Nowruz) as key inflection point. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed. Paraphrase correct. Base rate (55%) stated with source. Consistency check: "28 out of 100" -- articulated. Top evidence: 5 items, all factually verified. Blind spot: diplomatic breakthrough scenario. Status quo correctly identified. 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The -27pp correction from 55% to 28% demonstrates S2-2 recognized the outside view was too high.
- However, 28% implies nearly 1-in-3 chance of filtering being lifted, which is difficult to reconcile with: (a) NetBlocks never declaring Iran "not heavily filtered" after any prior shutdown, (b) government commitment through March 20, (c) unanimous expert consensus against restoration, and (d) active deployment of permanent whitelist infrastructure.
- The residual anchoring on 55% likely inflated the final prediction by ~10-15pp compared to what an unanchored analysis would produce.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good identification of key evidence categories. Strong evidence correctly identified: NetBlocks resolution-source continuity, expert consensus on structural change, status quo persistence. Moderate evidence: economic pressure, government signaling about timelines. Weak evidence: circumvention improvements, diplomatic talks. Each category well-reasoned. 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 6% -> Output: 6%, Delta = 0pp. This is a zero update despite receiving substantial new current evidence (Filterwatch permanent plan, Wired surveillance article, government statements, economic damage estimates, travel advisories). While the direction of evidence reinforces the low probability, a zero adjustment suggests insufficient engagement with the new information. Even a small downward adjustment (to 5%) or upward adjustment (to 7%) would demonstrate active processing. The reasoning states "I do not see new, time-proximate evidence indicating an imminent dismantling of whitelisting" which is correct but does not justify zero delta. 2/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Adequate. If halved: "even lower chance." If doubled: "low-teens (%)." Provides directional reasoning but lacks specific numbers for the halved case. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed meaningfully. Paraphrase correct and precise (includes ">24h" and "IRST" specifics). Base rate (6%) stated. Consistency check: "In 6 out of 100 timelines" -- articulated. Top evidence: 4 items, all factually valid. Blind spot: rapid political stabilization/deal. Status quo: correctly identified. 4/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The zero update is the main weakness. While 6% may be a reasonable final answer, the lack of any adjustment undermines confidence that the inside view engaged genuinely with new evidence.
- The final 6% is internally consistent with stated reasoning -- all evidence points to continued filtering, and the resolution criterion is strict.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 (missing; appears to have received S1-4)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise but effective. Correctly identifies NetBlocks still finding "heavily filtered/whitelisted" at day 32 as strong evidence. Government statements about restrictions until Nowruz and possibly permanent as strong. Filterwatch/Wired structural reports as moderate. Economic losses as moderate. Starlink circumvention and diplomatic thaw as weak. 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 55% (from S1-4, not S1-3 which is missing) -> Output: 25%, Delta = -30pp. Large correction with explicit factor decomposition: longest blackout in Iran's history (-20pp), regime intent to institutionalize whitelist (-10pp), external tech support/Starlink arrests (-5pp), economic pressure (+5pp). Direction and individual adjustments are well-reasoned. However, like S2-2, the final 25% remains high compared to the three forecasters not anchored on 55% (average ~8.7%), suggesting residual anchoring. 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. If halved (41 days): ~14% (-6pp). If doubled (164 days): ~30% (+10pp). Explicit numerical sensitivity, well-calibrated. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed concisely. Paraphrase correct. Base rate (55%) stated. Consistency check: "25 out of 100" -- articulated. Top evidence: 4 items within 20-word limit. Blind spot: elite split or foreign-policy deal. Status quo correctly identified. 3/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The -30pp correction is the largest in the ensemble and demonstrates recognition that 55% was too high.
- The pipeline issue of S1-3's absence is reflected in S2-4 receiving S1-4's output instead, introducing an anchoring problem.
- At 25%, this still implies ~1-in-4 chance, which is difficult to justify given the evidence base.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong: NetBlocks confirming "heavily filtered/whitelisted" at day 32, government statements. Moderate: Filterwatch/Wired structural reports, economic losses. Weak: Starlink/circumvention, diplomatic thaw. Compact but complete. Well-categorized. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input: 9% -> Output: 8%, Delta = -1pp. Small adjustment justified by current evidence reinforcing persistence: "recent sources reinforce persistence and institutional capacity more than they support normalization." The -1pp is conservative but defensible -- the current evidence aligns with the outside view rather than contradicting it, so minimal update is appropriate. 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed but contains inconsistencies. References a 55% base rate in places rather than the 9% actually received from S1-5. The specific numbers ("fall a further 6 pp to ~14%") do not follow from the stated 8% final prediction. This suggests confusion about which outside view was received. 2/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed. However, states "Outside-view base: 55%" in the checklist, which is incorrect -- the outside view received was 9% from S1-5. This inconsistency suggests the forecaster may have been exposed to multiple outside views or confused about its input. Top evidence: 4 items. Blind spot identified. Status quo correctly identified. 3/4

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The final 8% is well-calibrated and internally consistent with the broader evidence.
- However, the timeframe sensitivity section and calibration checklist reference a 55% base rate rather than the 9% from S1-5, suggesting the forecaster may have been confused about its input. Despite this, the final prediction of 8% appears sound.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 20% | 12% | -8pp | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 55% | 28% | -27pp | 14/16 | Partial (large correction but residual anchoring) |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 6% | 6% | 0pp | 12/16 | No (zero update despite new evidence) |
| S2-4 | o3 | 55%* | 25% | -30pp | 12/16 | Partial (large correction but residual anchoring) |
| S2-5 | o3 | 9% | 8% | -1pp | 12/16 | Yes (small update appropriate for confirming evidence) |

*S2-4 received S1-4 (55%) because S1-3 was missing.

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 receiving S1-4/o3 at 55%):** This was a severe test of cross-pollination robustness. S2-2 recognized the 55% base rate was too high and corrected dramatically (-27pp to 28%). However, the correction was incomplete -- the final 28% remains ~16pp above the median of the three forecasters not anchored on S1-4 (~8.7%). This demonstrates that cross-pollination with a poorly calibrated outside view introduces persistent anchoring bias that the inside view cannot fully overcome.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving S1-2/Sonnet 4.5 at 6%):** Received a well-calibrated outside view and made zero adjustment. While this avoids over-updating, it suggests GPT-5.2 may have been excessively deferential to the received base rate rather than independently evaluating the new evidence. Cross-pollination was neutral here -- neither helpful nor harmful.

- **S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3/GPT-5.2, which was missing):** Due to the pipeline failure with S1-3, S2-4 appears to have received S1-4's 55% instead. This unintended double-exposure to the inflated base rate (both S2-2 and S2-4 receiving 55%) amplified the anchoring problem across the ensemble.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1 at 12%, S2-5 at 8%):** These showed good convergence despite receiving different S1 inputs (20% and 9% respectively), suggesting both Sonnet 4.5 and o3 can anchor on evidence rather than base rate when the base rate is reasonable.

- **Net effect:** Cross-pollination was net negative for this forecast. The combination of S1-4's inflated base rate and the pipeline failure that caused S2-4 to also receive S1-4's output meant that 2 of 5 inside-view instances were anchored on a problematic 55% base rate. This pulled the ensemble average upward. Without these anchoring effects, the forecast would likely have been ~10-12% rather than 15.8%.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: NetBlocks must report Iran's internet is NOT "heavily filtered/whitelisted" for most users for >24 continuous hours before May 1, 2026.
- All correctly identified the forecast timeframe as ~81 days.
- All correctly assessed the current status: internet remains "heavily filtered/whitelisted" as of Feb 6-9, 2026, per NetBlocks.
- All correctly identified NetBlocks as the resolution authority.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Iran's internet shutdown began January 8, 2026, and has persisted ~32 days with ongoing whitelist-based filtering per NetBlocks.
2. NetBlocks has never declared Iranian internet "returned to normal" after any previous shutdown (2019, 2022).
3. Government committed to restrictions until "at least" March 20 (Nowruz), with signals of permanent implementation.
4. Expert consensus (Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani) uniformly predicts non-restoration.
5. Structural changes: Chinese-exported DPI middlebox technology enabling permanent whitelist architecture.
6. Economic damage: ~$35M/day losses, but regime prioritizes security over economics.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Misclassification of reference class members | Listed Kazakhstan 2022, Sri Lanka 2022, and Uganda 2021 as comparable cases that "resolved to pre-crackdown level within 3 months." These were brief political shutdowns without whitelist infrastructure deployment, structurally dissimilar to Iran's 2026 situation. | High (inflated base rate by ~35pp) |
| S1-4 | Claimed Iran 2022 "resolved" within 3 months | Listed Iran 2022 among cases that "resolved to pre-crackdown level within 3 months." This is contradicted by the Agent report: Instagram/WhatsApp blocks remained indefinitely after 2022, and NetBlocks never declared normalization. | Medium (further inflated base rate) |
| S2-5 | Base rate confusion | References 55% outside view base rate in timeframe and calibration sections despite receiving S1-5's 9% output | Low (final prediction of 8% is sound regardless) |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. All key facts (shutdown dates, death tolls, economic figures, expert quotes, NetBlocks assessments) are consistent across outputs and traceable to sources in the research. S1-4's reference class construction involved factual errors in case classification rather than fabrication of non-existent events.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research quality:** The Agent report delivered the single most critical finding for resolution interpretation -- that NetBlocks has never declared Iranian internet "returned to normal" after any shutdown. This finding appropriately anchored 3 of 5 forecasters.
2. **Strong evidence engagement by most forecasters:** S2-1 in particular demonstrated exemplary evidence weighting with explicit quantified factor-by-factor adjustments. S1-2's conditional probability decomposition was methodologically rigorous.
3. **Correct identification of resolution criteria bar:** Most forecasters recognized that the question requires NetBlocks to affirmatively report "not heavily filtered/whitelisted" -- a standard that has never been met for Iran historically.
4. **Comprehensive current evidence base:** The AskNews results provided extensive coverage from multiple international sources confirming ongoing whitelist status, permanent infrastructure changes, and expert consensus against restoration.

### Weaknesses
1. **Pipeline failure: missing S1-3 output:** GPT-5.2 produced no outside view, and the pipeline continued silently without logging an error. This cascaded through the cross-pollination system, causing S2-4 to receive an unintended input.
2. **S1-4's inflated reference class:** The 55% outside view from an overly broad global reference class was the largest single source of error, pulling the final prediction upward via S2-2 (28%) and S2-4 (25%).
3. **Insufficient anchoring correction:** Both S2-2 and S2-4 made large corrections from 55% but stopped at 25-28% -- still significantly above the evidence-consistent range of ~6-12% established by the other three forecasters.
4. **S2-3's zero update:** A 0pp change despite receiving substantial new current evidence suggests the GPT-5.2 inside view did not genuinely engage with the new information.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

Reasoning: Strong research that surfaced all critical information including the key NetBlocks language pattern finding. Three of five forecasters produced well-calibrated predictions (6-12%). Downgraded from B+ due to: (1) pipeline failure losing S1-3 entirely, (2) S1-4's inflated reference class producing a 55% outlier that propagated through cross-pollination to two inside views, (3) the resulting 15.8% final prediction being ~4-6pp higher than the evidence-consistent range. The final prediction is directionally correct but somewhat miscalibrated upward due to the anchoring effects of S1-4's inflated base rate.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- No major research improvements needed for this question type. The query strategy and tool selection were effective. The Agent report in particular was exceptionally valuable.
- Minor: AskNews deep research failed with a 403 rate limit error, though the standard query still returned sufficient articles.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Fix silent failure on missing outside view outputs:** The pipeline should either (a) retry the failed S1 call, (b) fail loudly and halt, or (c) at minimum log a warning in `metadata.json` and document which alternative S1 output was used for the affected S2 instance.
- **Detect and flag outlier outside views:** If one S1 output is >2 standard deviations from the ensemble mean, log a warning. S1-4's 55% was ~35pp above the next highest (S1-1 at 20%) -- this should trigger review.
- **Strengthen reference class selection guidance:** The outside view prompt should include language cautioning against overly broad reference classes that include structurally dissimilar cases, particularly when the question involves specific technical infrastructure changes (like whitelist deployment) that distinguish the current case from simpler political shutdowns.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **o3 (Forecaster 4 - S1-4):** Constructed an overly broad reference class that inflated the base rate. However, the other o3 instance (S1-5) used the much more appropriate Iran-only reference class with principled Beta shrinkage, suggesting this is a prompt interpretation issue rather than a model limitation. The divergence between two identical models on reference class selection highlights the value of ensemble diversity.
- **o3 (Forecaster 5 - S2-5):** Referenced the wrong base rate (55% instead of 9%) in some checklist items, suggesting confusion about which outside view it received. Final prediction was sound regardless.
- **GPT-5.2 (Forecaster 3 - S2-3):** Produced a zero-update inside view (6% -> 6%). May benefit from stronger encouragement to explicitly engage with new evidence even when the base rate appears well-calibrated.
- **Sonnet 4.5 (Forecasters 1-2):** Consistently strong performance across both stages. S1-2 produced the best outside view (16/16) and S2-1 produced the best inside view (16/16).
