## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Extreme ensemble divergence | Critical | Ensemble | Medians range from 16.0M (S2-2) to 18.8M (S2-5), a 2.8M spread; worst disagreement across all three TSA questions |
| Forecaster 5 applies +15% YoY growth despite shutdown | High | S2-5 | Applies 15% growth to 2025 baseline with only -3% combined disruption deduction, producing 18.8M median that strains plausibility |
| Forecaster 2 over-corrects for shutdown | High | S2-2 | Shifts median down to 16.0M (below 2025 baseline of 16.4M), implying negative YoY growth despite 13-21% early-Feb momentum |
| CDF at range maximum ~0.50 | Med | Aggregation | Final CDF reaches only ~50% at 17M, placing half the probability mass above the question range |
| No supervisor triggered | Med | Pipeline | Despite 2.8M median spread, supervisor not invoked |
| DB constraint error | Low | Metadata | "NOT NULL constraint failed: forecasts.final_prediction" - metadata recording issue |

## Summary

- **Question ID:** 42097
- **Question Title:** What will US airline passenger volume be for these weeks in February 2026, according to the TSA? (Feb 23, 2026-Mar 1, 2026)
- **Question Type:** numeric
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-02-15
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-03-02
- **Forecast Window:** 15 days (target week starts 8 days after forecast)
- **Final Prediction:** P10: 14.00M, P25: 15.87M; CDF at 17M = ~0.50
- **Step 2 Predictions (Medians):** S2-1: ~17.4M, S2-2: ~16.0M, S2-3: ~17.2M, S2-4: ~17.0M, S2-5: ~18.8M
- **Spread:** P10 range 13.5M-15.6M; P90 range 18.3M-20.7M
- **Total Cost:** $0.79
- **Duration:** Not recorded (DB error)
- **One-sentence quality assessment:** The longest-horizon question of the three produces the widest ensemble spread, with forecasters fundamentally disagreeing on whether the ongoing shutdown will suppress or merely dent the strong early-2026 growth momentum.

## 1. Research Query Analysis

### Key Research Findings

1. **2025 baseline**: Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025 = 16,405,121 passengers (correctly identified by multiple forecasters)
2. **DHS shutdown beginning Feb 14** - will be 9-16 days old during target week, approaching the 2-3 week threshold for major TSA disruptions
3. **Early Feb 2026 YoY growth**: 13-21% (from TSA data through Feb 12)
4. **Extended winter weather forecast**: AccuWeather meteorologists predict continued cold/snow in Northeast and Great Lakes through March
5. **Spring break season approaching**: Late February marks the beginning of spring break travel for some school districts
6. **Canadian-US travel weakness**: Air Transat canceling US flights (starts June, but reflects broader trend)

### Critical Information Gaps

- **No data from the target week or immediately preceding week** - this is the most forward-looking of the three questions
- **Shutdown resolution timeline unknown** - creates genuine binary uncertainty
- **Spring break calendar not researched** - which school districts have late-Feb vs. March break affects volumes significantly

### Research Quality Summary

Research appropriately surfaced the key factors. The challenge is that for a question 8-15 days out, the shutdown creates genuine bimodal uncertainty (resolves vs. persists) that is difficult to capture in a single distribution.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Median | P10-P90 | Key Approach |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~17.2M | 15.5M-18.8M | Moderate growth, acknowledged shutdown |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~16.0M | 13.5M-18.5M | Heavily weighted shutdown, very wide range |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~17.2M | 15.6M-18.3M | Balanced growth and risk |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~17.0M | 14.8M-18.5M | Growth + 2-3% shutdown drag |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~18.8M | 14.6M-20.7M | Applied full 15% growth, enormous range |

The outside view already shows the trimodal split:
- **Growth camp** (S1-5): Full YoY momentum persists, ~18.8M
- **Balanced camp** (S1-1, S1-3, S1-4): Growth with shutdown discount, ~17.0-17.2M
- **Disruption camp** (S1-2): Shutdown and weather dominate, ~16.0M

---

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5, receives S1-1)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework. Correctly identified shutdown as the "dominant factor" with a well-structured scenario analysis (optimistic/moderate/severe).
- **Central Estimate:** ~17.4M median. Applied +2.3M growth, -2.0M shutdown, -0.4M weather, -0.5M deceleration = -0.6M net adjustment from baseline.
- **Key Insight:** "The shutdown transforms this from a routine growth forecast into a crisis scenario." Appropriate framing.
- **Calibration Issue:** P10 at 15.5M is reasonable for severe disruption, but P90 at 18.8M seems achievable only if shutdown resolves and strong demand continues.
- **Score:** 12/16 - Solid reasoning, though the quantitative adjustments (5 separate factors) risk spurious precision.

#### S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5, receives S1-4)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Over-weighted shutdown impact for this specific week. Applied -3% to -8% shutdown drag plus -1% to -3% weather, -1% to -3% REAL ID. Cumulative deductions reached -4% to -11%.
- **Critical Issue:** The median of 16.0M is below the 2025 baseline of 16.4M, implying negative YoY growth. Given 13-21% YoY growth through early Feb 2026, this requires the shutdown to completely erase the growth trend and then some. While possible, it seems too pessimistic for the central estimate.
- **Distribution Width:** P10-P90 of 13.5M-18.5M (5M range) is the widest in the ensemble and reflects genuine uncertainty, which is appropriate. But the center is pulled too far down.
- **Score:** 10/16 - Good uncertainty width but central estimate too pessimistic.

#### S2-3 (GPT-5.2, receives S1-2)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong, balanced analysis. Correctly noted that the outside view anchor was high (~18M+) and shifted downward with clear justification.
- **Central Estimate:** ~17.2M. Anchored on 2025 baseline, applied +3% to +6% growth, -0% to -4% shutdown drag.
- **Key Insight:** "Growth-rate realism: while some early-Feb YoY comparisons may show double digits, broader 2025 narrative and expert commentary suggest single-digit growth." Good pushback on naive growth extrapolation.
- **Calibration:** P10 15.6M to P90 18.3M. Well-calibrated given the uncertainty.
- **Score:** 14/16 - Best individual forecast. Appropriate skepticism about growth persistence and balanced shutdown assessment.

#### S2-4 (o3, receives S1-3)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Efficient, quantitative approach. Used 2025 baseline (16.41M), applied +5% growth, -3% combined disruptions.
- **Central Estimate:** ~17.0M. The most conservative of the "balanced" group.
- **Key Insight:** "I infer underlying 2026/2025 growth for THIS week roughly +5%" - good adjustment from the 14% early-Feb rate.
- **Calibration:** P10 14.8M to P90 18.5M. Reasonable.
- **Score:** 13/16 - Clean reasoning, well-grounded in data.

#### S2-5 (o3, receives S1-5)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Correctly identified key evidence but then applied overly aggressive growth.
- **Central Estimate:** ~18.8M (median). Applied +15% YoY growth with only -3% combined shutdown and weather deduction.
- **Critical Issue:** Similar to Q42099 S2-2/S2-5, this forecaster naively extrapolates early-Feb growth rates. The 2025 same-week was 16.4M and the 2024 same-week was similar. Applying +15% growth produces 18.9M, which would be a late-February record by a massive margin.
- **Tail Extremes:** P90 of 20.7M would require an average of nearly 3.0M passengers/day for 7 days. The single-day record is 3.13M (Nov 30, 2025, a major holiday travel day).
- **Score:** 8/16 - Analytically structured but unrealistic growth assumption.

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Median | P10 | P90 | Score | Core Approach |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|-----|-------|---------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 17.4M | 15.5M | 18.8M | 12/16 | Growth with multi-factor shutdown discount |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 16.0M | 13.5M | 18.5M | 10/16 | Shutdown-dominant, below 2025 baseline |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 17.2M | 15.6M | 18.3M | 14/16 | Balanced, growth-rate-realism |
| S2-4 | o3 | 17.0M | 14.8M | 18.5M | 13/16 | Conservative balanced |
| S2-5 | o3 | 18.8M | 14.6M | 20.7M | 8/16 | Aggressive growth extrapolation |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

Cross-pollination was largely overridden by individual model tendencies:
- S2-2 received o3's balanced outside view (~17.0M median) but diverged sharply downward to 16.0M
- S2-3 received Sonnet 4.5's low outside view (~16.0M) and moved it upward to 17.2M (beneficial correction)
- S2-5 received its own outside view and maintained the aggressive growth estimate

The cross-pollination helped S2-3 moderate an extreme input (net positive effect), but couldn't prevent S2-2 and S2-5 from taking strong directional positions.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood:
- 7-day resolution window (Mon Feb 23 - Sun Mar 1, 2026)
- TSA checkpoint passenger metric
- That the target week is 8-15 days in the future

### Factual Consensus

1. Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025 total: 16,405,121 (correctly identified)
2. DHS shutdown began Feb 14, 2026 (all identified)
3. TSA agents working without pay (all identified)
4. FAA controllers remain funded (correctly noted as different from prior shutdowns)
5. Early Feb 2026 showing 13-21% YoY growth (all identified)

### Factual Errors

| Output | Error | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| S2-1 | Shutdown characterization | Referenced "2024's 43-day shutdown caused mass cancellations" - magnitude may be exaggerated | Low - directionally correct |
| S2-5 | Growth rate persistence | Assumed early-Feb growth rates (15%) persist unchanged to late Feb | High - inflated median by ~1.8M |
| S2-2 | REAL ID impact | Estimated 1-3% impact from REAL ID $45 fee, likely too high given 94% already compliant | Low-Med - added ~0.3M unnecessary drag |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. Some imprecision in historical shutdown characterizations.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong baseline identification**: All forecasters correctly anchored on the Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025 total of 16.4M
2. **Nuanced shutdown analysis**: Most forecasters correctly noted this question's target week coincides with the 2-3 week threshold for shutdown effects, making it the highest-risk of the three questions
3. **FAA funding distinction**: All correctly noted air traffic controllers remain paid, limiting worst-case scenarios vs. prior shutdowns
4. **Appropriate uncertainty**: With a 15-day horizon and an active shutdown, the wide ensemble spread partially reflects genuine uncertainty

### Weaknesses
1. **Bimodal ensemble without supervisor**: The 2.8M spread in medians should have triggered a supervisor review. The divergence reflects a genuine analytical question (how much does early-Feb growth persist?), but the pipeline didn't escalate it.
2. **Growth rate extrapolation**: S2-5's application of 15% YoY growth to late February is analytically weak. The same-week comparison shows 2024→2025 was roughly flat for this period.
3. **Over-correction**: S2-2 pulled the median below the 2025 baseline, which requires believing the shutdown fully offsets underlying demand growth and then some.
4. **Aggregation vulnerability**: The equal-weighted average is pulled in both directions by the outliers, producing a CDF that is wide but not well-centered.

### Overall Quality Grade

**This Forecast Grade: C+**

The three moderate forecasters (S2-1, S2-3, S2-4) produced reasonable and well-reasoned distributions centered around 17.0-17.4M. However, the two extreme forecasters (S2-2 at 16.0M, S2-5 at 18.8M) create an ensemble that is more a blending of two opposing views than a coherent probability distribution. The lack of supervisor intervention for this level of disagreement is a pipeline weakness.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- For forward-looking weekly forecasts, add explicit research on shutdown resolution timeline (Congressional voting calendar, funding negotiations)
- Include spring break calendar data for major school districts to assess late-Feb travel demand
- Pull prior-year same-week data as a mandatory anchor

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Lower the numeric divergence threshold**: The current threshold missed clear cases of ensemble disagreement across all three TSA questions
- **Add growth rate validation**: When forecasters cite early-period YoY growth, require comparison against the specific target week's historical YoY pattern
- **Consider trimmed mean or median aggregation**: For this question, the trimmed mean of S2-1, S2-3, S2-4 (~17.2M) would likely be better calibrated than the full equal-weighted average
- **Supervisor model should handle bimodal disagreement**: The ensemble split (growth vs. disruption camps) reflects a genuine analytical question that a supervisor could resolve with targeted research on shutdown precedent timing

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-2)**: Can over-correct when given a "crisis" framing. Should maintain that the median should reflect the most likely scenario, not the worst-case.
- **o3 (S2-5)**: Persistent tendency to apply recent growth rates without adjusting for target-period-specific seasonality.
- **GPT-5.2 (S2-3)**: Consistently the best performer on these TSA questions. Appropriate skepticism about growth rate persistence.

## Post-Resolution Analysis (Complete After Resolution)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Actual Outcome | Pending (resolves Mar 2) |
| Final Prediction | CDF median roughly ~17.2M |
| CRPS | Pending |

### Retrospective
- Pending resolution. Key questions to evaluate:
  - Was the shutdown still ongoing during Feb 23-Mar 1?
  - Did TSA absences materially increase after 2+ weeks without pay?
  - Was the actual outcome closer to the balanced forecasters (~17M) or the growth-forward forecaster (~19M)?
  - Did the extended winter weather forecast materialize?
