# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|

## 1. Research Query Analysis

### Research Tools Used

All standard research tools were active: Google (Serper), AskNews, agentic search, FRED, yFinance, Google Trends, and question URL scraping.

### Key Research Findings

The research pipeline successfully surfaced the most critical information:
1. **TSA actual data for Feb 9-12** (9,014,806 passengers) - the single most important data point
2. **DHS shutdown beginning Feb 14-15** - correctly identified as affecting only 2 of 7 days
3. **Presidents Day timing (Feb 17)** - correctly identified as creating pre-holiday surge
4. **Historical shutdown precedent** (2018-19) - appropriately noted 2-3 week lag before major disruptions
5. **Recent baseline** (Feb 2-8 week at ~14.48M) - good comparison anchor

### Critical Information Missed

- **2025 same-week comparison**: Feb 10-16, 2025 totaled 15,813,431. This would have been a natural reference class but was not explicitly cited by most forecasters.
- **Day-of-week patterns**: While mentioned qualitatively, no forecaster pulled specific prior-year Friday/Saturday/Sunday numbers for the same calendar week.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Google/AskNews results:** High quality - surfaced shutdown news, TSA data, holiday timing
- **Agentic search:** Effective at finding the TSA spreadsheet data
- **Source quality:** Appropriately distinguished government data (strong) from industry opinion (moderate) from irrelevant items (Chinese travel data correctly flagged as irrelevant by multiple forecasters)

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Median Estimate | P10-P90 Range | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~15.6M | 14.3M-17.4M | Reasonable range width | Did not anchor on known partial data (appropriate for outside view) |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~15.9M | 15.5M-16.35M | Tight distribution reflects partial data | Overly narrow for outside view stage |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~15.9M | 14.8M-17.15M | Good balance of range | Solid overall |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~16.55M | 15.5M-17.4M | Good central estimate | Slightly narrow lower tail |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~16.5M | 14.9M-18.0M | Wide tails capture uncertainty | Upper tail may be too fat |

The outside view stage performed well overall. Most forecasters correctly identified the Feb 2025 and recent baseline ranges as the primary reference class. The range of medians (15.6M-16.55M) reflects reasonable uncertainty about whether this would be a typical mid-February week or an above-average one.

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5, receives S1-1)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent. Correctly classified TSA partial data as "strong," shutdown timing as "moderate," and REAL ID as "weak." Correctly dismissed Chinese travel data as irrelevant.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Shifted median from ~15.6M to 16.2M. Well-justified by strong Mon-Thu base (9.015M) and Presidents Day weekend effect.
- **Calibration:** Good scenario analysis (conservative 14.5M to very strong 17.5M). P10-P90 of 14.3M-17.4M is reasonable given 3 unknown days.
- **Score:** 13/16 - Strong analysis with good source evaluation. Slightly wide lower tail (14.3M implies only ~5.3M for Fri-Sun, quite low).

#### S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5, receives S1-4)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Very thorough. Explicitly computed expected Fri-Sun range (6.80M-7.05M) from base data.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Maintained similar central estimate but dramatically narrowed the distribution (P10-P90: 15.5M-16.35M = only 850K range).
- **Calibration:** **Overconfident.** With 3 unknown days, a 850K range implies each day can only vary by ~280K from expectation. This ignores weather risk, shutdown uncertainty, and normal daily volatility.
- **Score:** 11/16 - Excellent reasoning but poor calibration. Distribution far too narrow.

#### S2-3 (GPT-5.2, receives S1-2)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Solid but more concise. Correctly anchored on 9,014,806 subtotal.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Shifted slightly upward. Good analysis of Presidents Day timing nuance (return travel shifting to Monday).
- **Calibration:** Appropriate. P10 14.8M to P90 17.15M captures reasonable uncertainty. Correctly identified fatter downside tail from shutdown risk.
- **Score:** 13/16 - Well-calibrated with appropriate tail width and good timing analysis.

#### S2-4 (o3, receives S1-3)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Concise and accurate. Good use of TSA data as primary constraint.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Centered at ~16.55M with reasonable range. Good quantitative analysis of weekly growth pattern (+13% WoW).
- **Calibration:** P10-P90 of 15.5M-17.4M is appropriately sized.
- **Score:** 13/16 - Efficient analysis, good quantitative grounding.

#### S2-5 (o3, receives S1-5)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework. Correctly computed point estimate (16.53M) from baseline scaling.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Good central estimate. However, P90 at 18.0M implies 9.0M for Fri-Sun, which would require ~3.0M/day average - very high even for a holiday weekend.
- **Calibration:** Somewhat overweight on the upside tail. The sigma-based parametric approach (sigma=0.75M) is sound methodologically but the resulting distribution is slightly too wide on the right.
- **Score:** 12/16 - Good methodology but upper tail too fat.

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | P50 | P10 | P90 | Score | Calibration Quality |
|--------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 16.2M | 14.3M | 17.4M | 13/16 | Good |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 15.9M | 15.5M | 16.35M | 11/16 | Too narrow |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 16.1M | 14.8M | 17.15M | 13/16 | Good |
| S2-4 | o3 | 16.55M | 15.5M | 17.4M | 13/16 | Good |
| S2-5 | o3 | 16.5M | 14.9M | 18.0M | 12/16 | Slightly wide upper |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

Cross-pollination had moderate effect. The cross-model instances (S2-2 receiving o3's outside view, S2-3 receiving Sonnet's) both produced reasonable central estimates but diverged on tail calibration. The same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) showed more variability between them than the cross-model pairs, suggesting cross-pollination didn't obviously increase or decrease diversity. The main diversity driver was model personality differences in uncertainty calibration rather than cross-pollination inputs.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All five instances correctly understood:
- The 7-day resolution window (Mon Feb 9 - Sun Feb 15, 2026)
- The metric (total TSA checkpoint passengers)
- That 4 of 7 days were already known

### Factual Consensus

1. Feb 9-12 subtotal: ~9,014,806 (correctly identified by all)
2. DHS shutdown began Feb 14-15 (correctly identified by all)
3. Presidents Day is Feb 17, creating pre-holiday travel surge (correctly identified by all)
4. Historical shutdowns show 2-3 week lag before major TSA impact (correctly identified by all)

### Factual Errors

| Output | Error | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| S2-1, S2-3 | Minor date confusion | Some references to "Feb 8" data when question starts Feb 9 | Low - didn't affect forecast |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected. All key facts (shutdown timing, TSA data, holiday dates) were verified against multiple sources.

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent use of known partial data**: All forecasters correctly anchored on the 9,014,806 confirmed subtotal for Feb 9-12, dramatically reducing uncertainty.
2. **Sophisticated shutdown analysis**: Every forecaster correctly identified the shutdown as starting late in the target week and referenced the historical 2-3 week lag pattern. This prevented overreacting to the shutdown news.
3. **Strong source quality assessment**: Multiple forecasters correctly dismissed irrelevant information (Chinese travel data, REAL ID fee) while emphasizing government data over opinion.

### Weaknesses
1. **Calibration disagreement**: P10 ranged from 14.3M to 15.5M across forecasters - a 1.2M spread at the tail is significant for what was effectively a 3-day forecast.
2. **S2-2 overconfidence**: The 850K P10-P90 range is unrealistically tight for 3 unknown days.
3. **No explicit YoY comparison**: None of the forecasters computed the same-week-last-year total (Feb 10-16, 2025 = 15.81M), which would have been a strong natural anchor.

### Overall Quality Grade

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

Strong central estimates well-anchored on known partial data, with good contextual analysis of shutdown timing and holiday effects. Marked down for calibration disagreement across the ensemble and one significantly overconfident forecaster.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add explicit same-week-prior-year lookup as a standard query for time-series questions
- Include day-of-week breakdown from prior years to better estimate remaining unknown days

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- For questions where partial data is available, consider a structured "known vs. unknown" decomposition in the prompt
- The supervisor should have triggered given the wide P10 spread (14.3M-15.5M); review numeric divergence threshold

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-2):** Tendency toward overconfidence; benefits from explicit calibration checks
- **o3 (S2-5):** Good parametric approach but upper tail can get unrealistically fat
