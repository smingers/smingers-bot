## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Massive forecaster disagreement on central estimate | Critical | Ensemble | Medians range from ~17.0M (S2-3, S2-4) to ~19.5M (S2-2), a 2.5M spread driven by different YoY growth assumptions |
| Forecaster 2 and 5 apply extreme YoY growth | High | S2-2, S2-5 | Both apply 15-25% YoY growth to the 2025 baseline, producing medians near 19-19.5M, far above the question's 17M range max |
| Forecaster 2 dismisses shutdown risk | High | S2-2 | Claims shutdown has "zero actual disruptions reported" and assigns <10% probability of major impact, ignoring that shutdown will be 2-8 days old during target week |
| Final CDF barely reaches 35% at the range maximum | Med | Aggregation | Final aggregated CDF reaches only ~0.35 at 17M (the question's range max), meaning the ensemble placed 65% probability above the question range |
| No supervisor triggered | Med | Pipeline | Despite enormous ensemble divergence, no supervisor review occurred |

## 1. Research Query Analysis

### Key Research Findings

The research pipeline surfaced critical information:
1. **Historical same-week data**: Feb 16-22, 2024 = 16,738,824; Feb 16-22, 2025 = 16,664,702 (essentially flat YoY)
2. **DHS shutdown beginning Feb 14** - correctly identified across all forecasters
3. **California winter storm** affecting Presidents Day weekend travel (Feb 15-17)
4. **Early Feb 2026 YoY growth** of 13-21% (from TSA data through Feb 12)
5. **Presidents Day timing** (Feb 17 is a Monday holiday)

### Critical Information Gaps

- **No day-level data for the partially-elapsed week**: Unlike Q42098, no partial-week actuals were available for this future week
- **Polymarket data**: Low-volume prediction market data ($109 total) was cited but provided limited signal

### Research Quality Summary

Research was strong on surfacing relevant data. The key analytical question was how to reconcile early Feb 2026's 13-21% YoY growth with the same-week-2025 baseline of 16.66M. This is where forecasters diverged sharply.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Median | P10-P90 | Key Approach |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~17.5M | 15.8M-18.8M | Applied moderate growth + shutdown drag |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~19.0M | 16.5M-20.5M | Applied full 17% YoY growth, dismissed shutdown |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~17.0M | 15.9M-18.1M | Conservative, anchored on 2024-25 average |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~16.9M | 15.3M-18.6M | Balanced growth + shutdown, moderate uncertainty |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~19.3M | 16.5M-21.6M | Applied 15% growth with very wide tails |

The fundamental disagreement is clear in the outside view: forecasters split into two camps:
- **Conservative (S1-1, S1-3, S1-4)**: Anchored on the 16.66M 2025 baseline, applied modest growth with shutdown discount -> medians 17.0-17.5M
- **Growth-forward (S1-2, S1-5)**: Applied the observed 13-21% early-Feb YoY growth rate directly to the baseline -> medians 19.0-19.3M

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### S2-1 (Sonnet 4.5, receives S1-1)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong. Correctly classified shutdown as having a meaningful causal channel. Identified California storm as an additional negative factor.
- **Central Estimate:** ~17.5M (median between 17.2M and 17.7M). Represents +5% over 2025, reflecting suppressed growth from shutdown + storm.
- **Key Insight:** Correctly framed the forecast as "two simultaneous disruptions" (shutdown + storm) that compound independently.
- **Calibration:** Reasonable. P10 15.8M to P90 18.8M provides adequate uncertainty.
- **Score:** 13/16 - Well-reasoned with good evidence integration.

#### S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5, receives S1-4)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Problematic. Classified shutdown risk as "weak evidence" and claimed "zero actual disruptions reported." Applied the full early-Feb YoY growth rate (17%) to produce a median of 19.0M.
- **Critical Error:** The logic of "zero disruptions observed through Feb 15 therefore shutdown won't matter for Feb 16-22" ignores that the shutdown will be 2-8 days old during the target week. Historical precedent shows 2-3 weeks for major disruptions, but some effect within the first week is plausible.
- **Growth Rate Error:** Applying the 13-21% YoY growth observed in early Feb to the Presidents Day week ignores that (a) this specific week was already elevated in 2025, and (b) early-month growth rates don't necessarily persist.
- **Calibration:** The P10 at 16.5M (essentially 2025 level) is reasonable as a floor, but the central mass at 19-20M is aggressive.
- **Score:** 8/16 - Good analytical structure but key reasoning errors on shutdown impact and growth extrapolation.

#### S2-3 (GPT-5.2, receives S1-2)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent. Balanced assessment noting seasonality as "strong evidence," shutdown as "moderate evidence," and Polymarket as "weak evidence."
- **Central Estimate:** ~17.0M. Anchored on 2024-25 same-week average with small downward adjustment for shutdown.
- **Key Insight:** "Small downward shift from the outside-view median and slightly increased uncertainty, especially on the downside." Appropriate and well-calibrated.
- **Calibration:** P10 15.9M to P90 18.1M is the narrowest range but appropriate given the stable historical baseline and limited forecast horizon.
- **Score:** 14/16 - Best individual forecast with strong anchoring and appropriate adjustments.

#### S2-4 (o3, receives S1-3)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good. Correctly identified 2024-25 weekly totals as the primary anchor.
- **Central Estimate:** ~17.1M. Applied +1.5% trend growth, -1.5% composite drag (shutdown -1%, storm -0.5%), netting to ~0% YoY change.
- **Key Insight:** Efficient, quantitative analysis with clear adjustments.
- **Calibration:** P10 15.3M to P90 18.6M provides reasonable uncertainty.
- **Score:** 13/16 - Clean quantitative reasoning, well-calibrated.

#### S2-5 (o3, receives S1-5)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Mixed. Correctly identified TSA data and growth trends but then applied +15% YoY growth with only -1.5% combined deduction for shutdown and weather.
- **Central Estimate:** ~19.3M. This would be a new record for any Presidents Day week by a large margin.
- **Growth Rate Issue:** Applied 15% growth to a specific week that was already at its 2024 level (16.66M = essentially flat 2024-2025). The assumption that early-Feb growth rates persist into the Presidents Day week is questionable.
- **Calibration:** Extremely wide tails (P10 16.5M to P90 21.6M = 5.1M range). P90 of 21.6M would require over 3.0M passengers per day for 7 days, above even peak holiday periods.
- **Score:** 9/16 - Sound structure but unrealistic growth assumptions and a P90 that strains credulity.

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | Median | P10 | P90 | Score | Core Issue |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|-----|-------|------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 17.5M | 15.8M | 18.8M | 13/16 | Solid |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 19.0M | 16.5M | 20.5M | 8/16 | Over-extrapolates growth, dismisses shutdown |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 17.0M | 15.9M | 18.1M | 14/16 | Best calibration |
| S2-4 | o3 | 17.1M | 15.3M | 18.6M | 13/16 | Well-anchored |
| S2-5 | o3 | 19.3M | 16.5M | 21.6M | 9/16 | Extreme growth, fat tails |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

Cross-pollination had limited effectiveness here. S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5) received S1-4 (o3) which had a moderate central estimate of ~16.9M, but S2-2 dramatically diverged upward to 19.0M, essentially ignoring the conservative anchor. Similarly, S2-3 (GPT-5.2) received S1-2's (Sonnet 4.5) aggressive growth estimate but correctly tempered it back down to 17.0M, showing beneficial resistance to an outlier input.

The cross-pollination helped S2-3 and S2-4 produce well-calibrated outputs despite receiving varied inputs, but couldn't prevent S2-2 and S2-5 from diverging to extreme growth estimates.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (TSA passengers Feb 16-22, 2026).

### Factual Consensus

1. Feb 16-22, 2025 total: ~16.66M (correctly identified by all)
2. DHS shutdown began Feb 14 (all identified)
3. California storm affecting Presidents Day weekend (all identified)
4. Early Feb 2026 showing 13-21% YoY growth (all identified)

### Factual Errors

| Output | Error | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| S2-2 | Growth extrapolation | Applied early-Feb rolling YoY growth (13-21%) to a different calendar week with different seasonal characteristics | High - inflated central estimate by ~2M |
| S2-5 | Growth extrapolation | Same issue - applied +15% YoY without adjusting for this specific week's historical pattern (flat 2024→2025) | High - inflated central estimate by ~2.3M |
| S2-2 | Shutdown dismissal | Claimed "zero actual disruptions" as evidence shutdown won't matter, ignoring the shutdown will be ongoing during the target week | Medium - led to insufficient downward adjustment |

### Hallucinations

- S2-2 referenced a "2024's 43-day shutdown" - this appears to reference the 2024 government shutdown which did occur, though the claim of it being exactly 43 days and causing "mass cancellations" may be imprecise. Not a pure hallucination but loosely stated.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Conservative forecasters (S2-1, S2-3, S2-4) were well-calibrated**: Properly anchored on the 2024-2025 same-week baseline (~16.7M) with modest adjustments.
2. **Shutdown analysis was nuanced**: Most forecasters correctly noted the 2-3 week lag for major disruptions while still accounting for early-stage effects.
3. **Storm identification**: All forecasters correctly surfaced the California winter storm as a regional negative factor.

### Weaknesses
1. **Dangerous growth extrapolation**: Two of five forecasters (S2-2, S2-5) naively applied early-February YoY growth rates to a different calendar week, producing unrealistically high estimates.
2. **No supervisor intervention**: The ensemble had an enormous divergence (medians ranging from 17.0M to 19.5M) but no supervisor was triggered. This is a pipeline configuration issue.
3. **Aggregated CDF skew**: The two high-growth forecasters pulled the aggregated CDF upward, placing ~65% of probability mass above the question's 17M range maximum.

### Overall Quality Grade

**This Forecast Grade: C**

The ensemble is severely split between reasonable and unreasonable forecasters. The three well-calibrated forecasters (S2-1, S2-3, S2-4) produced strong individual forecasts, but the two growth-extrapolating outliers (S2-2, S2-5) contaminated the aggregated output. The final CDF places most probability mass above the question range, suggesting poor scoring if the actual outcome falls in the 16-17M range (as historical precedent suggests).

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add a specific "same-week-prior-year" lookup as a mandatory research step for recurring time-series questions
- Flag when early-period growth rates significantly differ from same-period-prior-year patterns

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Divergence threshold needs lowering for numeric questions**: The current threshold did not catch this massive disagreement
- **Add growth rate sanity check**: When forecasters apply YoY growth, prompt should verify that the specific target period exhibited similar growth historically
- **Consider trimmed mean aggregation**: Removing the highest and lowest forecaster before averaging would have produced a much better result here (median ~17.1M from S2-1, S2-3, S2-4)

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (S2-2)**: Tendency to over-weight recent momentum data and dismiss structural risks. Should be prompted to compare growth rates across specific calendar weeks, not just periods.
- **o3 (S2-5)**: Fat-tail calibration can produce unrealistic extremes (P90 of 21.6M). Should be prompted to cross-check tail percentiles against known system capacity.
- **GPT-5.2 (S2-3)**: Best performer on this question. Appropriate anchoring and conservative adjustments.

## Post-Resolution Analysis (Complete After Resolution)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Actual Outcome | Pending (resolves Feb 23) |
| Final Prediction | CDF median roughly ~17.5M |
| CRPS | Pending |

### Retrospective
- Pending resolution. Key questions to evaluate:
  - Did the DHS shutdown (day 2-8) cause measurable TSA throughput reduction?
  - How severe was the California storm's actual impact on national volumes?
  - Was the actual outcome closer to the conservative forecasters (17M) or the growth-forward forecasters (19M)?
