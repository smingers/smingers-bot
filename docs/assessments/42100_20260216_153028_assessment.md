## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| No current OpenRouter share data | High | Research | Pipeline could not extract actual numeric token-share data from OpenRouter's rankings page (only header/nav scraped). Most recent hard data point is Nov 11, 2025 (14.7%), leaving a 3+ month gap |
| Inconsistent "nearly 30%" interpretation | Medium | S1-1, S1-2, S2-1 | Multiple sources report "nearly 30%" but this refers to peak weeks in mid-2025, not sustained levels. Some forecasters treated it as a recent/current level rather than a historical spike |
| Wide inter-forecaster spread on median | Medium | Aggregation | Inside view medians range from ~20 to ~25 (S2-2 at 20% vs S2-3 at 23%), producing moderate spread given the high inherent uncertainty |
| Speculative current baseline | Low | S1-3, S1-4, S2-5 | Without Feb 2026 data, forecasters inferred "current ~15-18%" from Nov 2025 datapoint and CNBC rankings, which is reasonable but unverified |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (2 steps) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (hit rate limit on deep research) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No (not relevant) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not relevant) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No (not MC question) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (2 URLs scraped) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "OpenRouter rankings Chinese models share" (Google) — 3 results
2. "Chinese LLMs gaining share OpenRouter" (Google News) — 3 results
3. "List Chinese author token share OpenRouter weekly market share history; include Qwen Deepseek Baichuan Moonshot Yi, cached rankings from 2025-2026" (Agent, 2 steps)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "OpenRouter market share Chinese models 2026" (Google) — 3 results
2. "Chinese AI models OpenRouter ranking February 2026" (Google News) — 3 results
3. "Provide the latest weekly token-share data for Chinese-authored models on OpenRouter..." (AskNews) — 18 results

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2024-2025 trends, archived snapshots | Feb 2026 news, recent model releases |
| Content type | Token-share data, trend reports, industry analysis | Model launches, rankings positions, pricing |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | 3 concrete datapoints (Jan/Jul/Nov 2025), 13% average, 30% peak | DeepSeek #3/Kimi #4 Feb ranking, Qwen-3.5/GLM-5/DeepSeek V4 releases |

**Analysis:**
- Historical and current queries were well-differentiated with minimal overlap.
- Historical queries effectively targeted base rate establishment via the Agent search, which extracted three concrete weekly datapoints (Jan 5: ~5%, Jul 14: ~28%, Nov 11: 14.7%) plus the 13% 2025 average.
- Current queries surfaced critical context: CNBC's Feb 2026 rankings (Chinese models #3 and #4), the concentrated Chinese model release wave (Qwen-3.5, GLM-5, DeepSeek V4, MiniMax M2.5), and pricing differentials.
- **Key gap:** The pipeline could not extract actual numeric data from OpenRouter's live rankings page — only the page navigation/header was captured. This is the single biggest research limitation.
- Agent search acknowledged data gaps explicitly and recommended follow-up queries (Wayback CDX, social-media screenshots) that were not executed.
- AskNews deep research hit rate limits, though the standard query returned 18 rich articles in Chinese and English.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report stayed appropriately factual, noting data gaps and what remains to be recovered. It did not provide probability estimates. AskNews articles were news reports about model launches and market trends — factual and appropriate. The question URL scrapes returned descriptive content about OpenRouter's features without numerical share data. Overall, research outputs remained appropriately informational and did not attempt to forecast.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Three concrete weekly Chinese share datapoints: Jan 5, 2025 (~5%), Jul 14, 2025 (~28%), Nov 11, 2025 (14.7%)
  - 2025 YTD average: 13% of weekly token volume
  - Peak weeks: "nearly 30%" in H2 2025
  - Feb 2026 OpenRouter rankings: DeepSeek #3, Kimi K 2.5 #4 (CNBC)
  - Pricing: DeepSeek $0.30/M tokens vs Claude $10/M tokens (33x gap)
  - Major Chinese model releases: Qwen-3.5 (Feb 9), GLM-5 (Feb 12), MiniMax M2.5 (Feb 13), DeepSeek V4 rumored
  - Expert commentary on adoption dynamics (Lambert, Rui Ma, industry execs)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - Actual current (Feb 2026) numeric token-share data from OpenRouter
  - Dec 2025 and Jan 2026 weekly share data (any concrete post-Nov datapoint)
  - The original identical question (ID 41889) which opened Feb 11 — its existing forecasts could inform this one

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Good — surfaced SCMP, Al Jazeera, NBC, Interconnects articles
  - Agent report: Good — best quantitative scaffold with three hard datapoints, transparent about limitations
  - AskNews articles: Very good — 18 rich articles covering Chinese model releases, pricing, market dynamics
  - Question URL scraping: Limited — only captured OpenRouter page navigation, not actual data

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | S1 Input Median |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | ~21% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~19.5% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~15.25% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ~21% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | ~20% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Comprehensive Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly identified the concentrated release wave (Qwen-3.5, GLM-5, DeepSeek V4, M2.5) as the strongest upward catalyst. Also weighed cost advantage (33x gap) and expert pessimism about quality gap. Score: 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~21% -> Output ~22%, delta = +1pp. Modest upward shift justified by confirmed Feb 2026 release wave. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good halved/doubled analysis — narrower with 31 days, wider 12-35% with 124 days. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed. Good blind-spot identification (GPT-5.5 with price cut). Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=14, P20=17, P40=21, P60=25, P80=29, P90=33. Well-balanced with appropriate tails.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong multi-tier evidence framework. Uniquely identified P10=15 as acknowledging possible no-growth scenario, which is defensible. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~19.5% -> Output ~21%, delta = +1.5pp. Justified by confirmed product releases and structural cost advantage. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good — discussed how 4.5-week window would shift distribution. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Sensitivity check comparing P10→17 and P90→30 shifts shows self-awareness. Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=15, P20=18, P40=20, P60=23, P80=27, P90=33. Slightly more conservative than S2-1.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Excellent — used CNBC's top-4 ranking as key "inside-view signal" that current share regime is higher than Nov 2025. Best use of the available current evidence. Score: 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~15.25% -> Output ~22%, delta = +6.75pp. **Largest shift in ensemble**, driven primarily by CNBC ranking data suggesting current share already higher than Nov baseline. Well-justified — this forecaster received the most conservative outside view and correctly identified it needed significant upward revision. Score: 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good — discussed halved (hew to current regime) and doubled (widen tails materially). Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Good consistency check (implied median ~22, mean ~24). Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=11, P20=14.5, P40=19.5, P60=24.5, P80=31.5, P90=38. Widest distribution — appropriately reflects high uncertainty and allows for April "spike week."

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong hierarchy with clear causal mechanisms. Identified historical release-bump pattern (6-10pp within a month) as key precedent. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~21% -> Output ~25%, delta = +4pp. Justified by release wave 2 months pre-measurement and historical pattern of post-release bumps. Modeled as logit-normal with μ for median ~25%. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good — halved lowers by ~1pp, doubled widens. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Good blind-spot (GPT-5.2 price cut). Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=13, P20=17, P40=22, P60=26, P80=32, P90=38. Most optimistic central tendency but with appropriate fat tails.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured with clear hierarchy. Identified three upward forces (release wave, price gap widening, no comparable US releases) and two limiting forces (GPT-5.5/Gemini Ultra, chip constraints). Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~20% -> Output ~23%, delta = +3pp. Justified by confirmed releases and expanding price gap. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good — discussed per-blockbuster shifts of 2-6pp visible in 2-3 weeks. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Clearly stated adjustment logic (+1pp at low percentiles, +3pp at middle, +4pp at high). Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=12, P20=17, P40=21, P60=25, P80=31, P90=37. Well-balanced.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final Median | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~21% | ~22% | +1pp | 13/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~19.5% | ~21% | +1.5pp | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~15.25% | ~22% | +6.75pp | 14/16 | Yes (corrected overly conservative S1-2) |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~21% | ~25% | +4pp | 12/16 | Yes (release wave justification) |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~20% | ~23% | +3pp | 12/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2 receiving o3, S2-3 receiving Sonnet 4.5, S2-4 receiving GPT-5.2):** All engaged meaningfully with their received outside views. S2-3 (GPT-5.2) showed the most dramatic correction, receiving S1-2's conservative ~15.25% median and correctly identifying via CNBC data that the current regime is likely higher. This is cross-pollination working as intended — the model received a conservative anchor and used new evidence to appropriately revise upward.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1 receiving S1-1, S2-5 receiving S1-5):** Both made modest upward adjustments (+1pp and +3pp respectively) from their own outside views. S2-5 showed slightly more movement, possibly because S1-5's lower base (~20%) left more room for upward revision.

- **Diversity impact:** Cross-pollination had a convergence effect in this forecast. Despite S1 medians ranging from 15.25% to 21%, S2 medians converged to 20-25%. This is appropriate — the inside view evidence (CNBC rankings, release wave) was uniformly bullish, so convergence toward higher values makes sense. S2-3's large correction from S1-2's conservative anchor was the most valuable cross-pollination outcome.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: sum of Chinese author token counts / total (excluding "others") on OpenRouter Rankings for week of April 19, 2026.
- All correctly identified the 70-day forecast window.
- All correctly assessed the core challenge: sparse historical data with high volatility and no current numeric datapoint.

### Factual Consensus

1. Chinese share on OpenRouter: ~5% (Jan 2025) → ~28% (Jul 2025) → 14.7% (Nov 2025) — confirmed by all
2. 2025 YTD average: ~13% of weekly token volume — confirmed by all
3. Peak weeks reached "nearly 30%" in H2 2025 — confirmed by all
4. CNBC reports DeepSeek #3, Kimi K 2.5 #4 on OpenRouter (late Jan 2026) — confirmed by inside view instances
5. Major Chinese model releases in Feb 2026: Qwen-3.5, GLM-5, MiniMax M2.5, DeepSeek V4 expected — confirmed by all inside view instances

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-5 | "GPT-5.5 and Gemini-Ultra-2 landed in Jan 2026" | Potentially unverifiable claim from training data | Low — used only as downside scenario |
| S2-4 | "Historical evidence: each of DeepSeek-R1 and Kimi-K2 produced 6-10pp share bumps within a month" | Approximately correct for DeepSeek R1; Kimi K2's bump timing less clear from sources | Low — magnitude is directionally correct |
| Multiple | "Current share ~15-18%" | Extrapolation from Nov 2025; actual Feb 2026 value unknown | Medium — reasonable inference but unverified |

### Hallucinations

No significant hallucinations detected. All forecasters were transparent about data limitations and clearly distinguished between confirmed datapoints and inferred current values. This is a notable strength given the temptation to fabricate precise weekly figures.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent transparency about data limitations**: All forecasters explicitly acknowledged the 3+ month gap since the last concrete datapoint and avoided fabricating numbers.
2. **Good use of sparse data**: The Agent report's three hard datapoints (Jan 5%, Jul 28%, Nov 14.7%) plus the 13% average were effectively leveraged across all forecasters to establish plausible ranges.
3. **Strong inside view integration**: The CNBC rankings data and release wave information were correctly identified as upward catalysts, and the magnitude of adjustments was generally well-calibrated.
4. **Appropriate uncertainty**: The final P10-P90 range (15%-37.2%) appropriately captures the high historical volatility of this metric.
5. **Good convergence**: Despite different outside view anchors, inside views converged to a sensible 20-25% range, reflecting consistent interpretation of current evidence.

### Weaknesses
1. **Research gap on current data**: The pipeline's inability to extract OpenRouter's live numeric data means all forecasters are extrapolating from a 3+ month old datapoint. This is the single largest quality limitation.
2. **No reference to the original identical question (41889)**: The fine print explicitly references an original question that opened Feb 11. Its existing community or bot forecasts could have been an additional calibration anchor.
3. **Limited discussion of "excluding others" definition**: The resolution criteria specify dividing by total excluding "others" — none of the forecasters discussed what fraction "others" represents or how it affects the calculation versus the reported shares.
4. **Agent search could have been deeper**: The Agent only took 2 steps (of 7 available). Additional steps targeting Wayback CDX or specific date searches might have recovered more recent data.

### Overall Quality Grade

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The forecast demonstrates strong analytical reasoning, appropriate use of limited data, and good calibration against historical volatility. The ensemble showed healthy diversity in outside views with effective convergence in inside views, driven by consistent interpretation of current evidence. The main limitation — inability to extract current OpenRouter share data — is primarily a pipeline/tooling constraint rather than an analytical failure. The forecasters compensated well by using CNBC rankings as a proxy for current regime. The wide uncertainty bands appropriately reflect the genuine difficulty of forecasting a highly volatile weekly metric ~9 weeks out.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- **Scraping enhancement**: The OpenRouter rankings page uses client-side rendering. Investigate headless browser scraping or API endpoint discovery (e.g., `openrouter.ai/api/usage/rankings?resolution=weekly&period=author`) to extract actual numeric data.
- **Original question lookup**: When fine print references an "original identical question," the pipeline should automatically fetch its community prediction and any existing bot forecasts as additional context.
- **Agent step utilization**: The Agent only used 2 of 7 available steps. For questions with known data gaps, encourage the Agent to pursue alternative data sources (Wayback Machine CDX API, social media screenshots, Substack newsletters).

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- For resolution-source-dependent questions (where the answer literally appears on a specific webpage), add a specialized scraping strategy that attempts multiple methods (headless browser, API discovery, cached versions).
- Consider adding a "data freshness" warning when the most recent hard datapoint is >30 days old, prompting more aggressive search strategies.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5 (S1-2):** The conservative outside view (median ~15.25%) was effectively corrected by the inside view, but anchoring so heavily on a declining trend when the decline period itself showed high volatility was suboptimal. The other Sonnet 4.5 instance (S1-1) handled this better.
- **GPT-5.2 (S2-3):** Best overall performance — received the most conservative outside view and produced the best-justified large correction. Excellent use of CNBC ranking data as a regime-change signal.
- **o3 (S2-4):** Most bullish central tendency (median ~25%) driven by release-wave bump logic. Reasoning was sound but the +4pp shift from an already reasonable 21% base may slightly overweight release catalysts given uncertain adoption dynamics.
