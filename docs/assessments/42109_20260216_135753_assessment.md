# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Missing recent March actuals | High | Research | Pipeline failed to surface March 2025 (71), March 2024 (63), or full Q1 2025 monthly breakdown (25-40-71) — the most relevant comparison data |
| Hallucinated historical March data | Medium | S1-4, S1-5 | Both o3 instances fabricated month-by-month March delivery figures (S1-4: "March 2025 = 63"; S1-5: "March 2025 = 67") when actual was 71 |
| Overly conservative median | Medium | Aggregation | Final median ~57 is below all three recent March actuals (61, 63, 71). January weakness was arguably overweighted vs established March seasonal strength |
| Unsourced historical March average | Low | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | Cited "Historical March average (2018-2025): 62 deliveries" without clear sourcing |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (hit rate limit) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No (not relevant) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not relevant) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No (not relevant) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "Airbus monthly deliveries 2021-2025" (Google)
2. "Airbus production rate ramp-up 2025" (Google News)
3. "Provide Airbus commercial aircraft delivery numbers by month from 2018 through 2025..." (Agent)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "Airbus March 2026 delivery guidance" (Google)
2. "Airbus deliveries January 2026 February 2026" (Google News)
3. "Give recent articles discussing Airbus commercial aircraft production rates and expected deliveries for Q1 2026..." (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2018-2025 annual/monthly patterns | Jan-Feb 2026 news and guidance |
| Content type | Production rates, delivery totals, capacity plans | Analyst forecasts, exec commentary |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Annual baselines, supply chain context | January 2026 = 19, Bernstein 865 forecast |

**Analysis:**
- Historical and current queries were reasonably discrete with minimal overlap.
- Historical queries correctly targeted base rate establishment with annual totals and production targets.
- **Critical gap:** The Agent report acknowledged it couldn't extract the full monthly delivery time series but only surfaced sporadic months (March 2023=61, Nov 2025=72, Dec 2025=121). It did NOT surface March 2024 (63) or March 2025 (71), which are the two most relevant comparison points.
- Current queries successfully surfaced January 2026=19 and the Bernstein analyst downgrade to 865.
- The AskNews query hit rate limits, potentially missing useful recent articles.
- **Missing queries:** A direct search for "Airbus March 2025 deliveries" or "Airbus Q1 2025 monthly deliveries" would have been high-value.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report stayed factual, noting the data set would be "suitable to model or forecast" rather than providing probability estimates. It relayed analyst estimates (~900 internal assumption, 1,044 AirInsight forecast) but flagged these as "industry estimates, not official Airbus guidance." AskNews results included the Bernstein analyst forecast (865 vs consensus 910) which is factual reporting of expert opinion. Overall, research outputs remained appropriately informational.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - January 2026 = 19 deliveries (multiple sources, well-corroborated)
  - 2025 FY = 793 (official Airbus data)
  - Supply chain constraints (engine bottlenecks, fuselage panel issues)
  - Production ramp-up plans (rate 75 by 2027, new FALs)
  - Bernstein 2026 forecast = 865 vs consensus 910
  - January 2025 = 26, January 2024 = 30 (YoY comparison)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - March 2025 = 71 deliveries (the single most relevant data point)
  - March 2024 = 63 deliveries
  - Q1 2025 monthly breakdown: Jan 25, Feb 40, Mar 71
  - February 2025 = 40 deliveries
  - 2025 monthly breakdown by family (A220: 93, A320: 607, A330: 36, A350: 57)

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Good — surfaced Airbus official pages, Seattle Times, CNBC
  - Agent report: Mixed — good synthesis but couldn't extract the key monthly PDFs
  - AskNews articles: Moderate — confirmed key facts, surfaced Bernstein note, but hit rate limit
  - Question URL scraping: Good — captured January 2026 data from Airbus O&D page

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough coverage of all sources; correctly distinguished factual data from executive opinions. Properly noted the Agent report contains "unverified estimates." Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considered four reference classes. Selected "Monthly deliveries in 2025 with emphasis on Q1 patterns and March 2023." Reasonable but didn't attempt to gather March 2024-2025 data. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 6-week horizon. Discussed Q1 seasonal patterns and backloading. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Central estimate of 60-65 from 2025 average (66.1) and March 2023 (61). Sound two-scenario analysis. Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=48, P90=78 — somewhat narrow range given uncertainty.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Good coverage, correctly computed 2025 monthly average of 66.1 and December-excluded average of 61.1. Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Selected "Monthly deliveries in 2025." Clear rationale. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct 43-day horizon. Good discussion of quarterly and seasonal patterns. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Central range 55-75 with 60-65 tendency. Well-reasoned. Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=45, P90=85 — wider and more appropriate range than S1-1.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive six-source analysis. Good identification of the date inconsistency on Airbus page. Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Creative dual approach: "typical non-December monthly deliveries in ~750-850 delivery years" + March seasonal share heuristic (7-9%). Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good. Correctly discussed quarter-end effects and December vs non-December distinction. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Central ~70 with range ~40-100. Used 7-9% share of 800-950 annual. P90=100 is very wide — perhaps too aggressive. Score: 3/4

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient and well-structured. Correctly flagged timestamp inconsistency. Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Selected "March deliveries in the last eight years (2018-2025)" — the best possible class. **However, provided specific values that were partially hallucinated.** March 2025 listed as 63 (actual: 71), March 2024 as 66 (actual: 63). Score: 2/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent — correctly described the historical 1:2:3 Q1 ratio and applied it to derive ~65 for March. Score: 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Normal(62, 11) well-derived. The 1:2:3 ratio method was the most sophisticated approach in the ensemble. Score: 3/4

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and well-organized. Correctly set aside analyst projections for outside view. Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Selected March-specific class. Listed values including March 2025 as ~67 (actual: 71). Mean ~60, s.d. ~10. Score: 2/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Good — noted March share averages ~8% of annual. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchored at mean=60, sigma=10. Upper tail capped at 75 based on "never exceeded 75 before April" — **incorrect: March 2019 was reportedly ~74 and March 2025 was 71.** Too tight. Score: 2/4

- **Score:** 10/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Median) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~63 | 12/16 | Clean two-scenario analysis | Somewhat narrow range |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~63 | 12/16 | Good December-excluded baseline | Didn't attempt March-specific class |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~67 | 12/16 | Creative dual reference class | P90=100 aggressive upper tail |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~61.5 | 12/16 | Best methodology (1:2:3 ratio) | Hallucinated March 2025 as 63 (actual: 71) |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~57.5 | 10/16 | Good structural framework | Hallucinated data, tight upper bound |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | S1 Input Median |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | ~63 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~61.5 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~63 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ~67 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | ~57.5 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good Strong/Moderate/Weak framework application. Correctly identified January=19, Bernstein 865, and CEO Faury comments as key evidence. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~63 -> Output ~54, delta = -9. Direction justified by January weakness. **Magnitude seems excessive** — median below all three recent March actuals. Score: 2/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good halved/doubled discussion. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All seven elements completed meaningfully. Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=42, P90=68. P90=68 is problematic — below March 2025 actual (71). Distribution too compressed and low.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Comprehensive. Adopted 1:2:3 ratio from received S1-4. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~61.5 -> Output ~59.5, delta = -2. Modest, well-justified. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halved (mid-March ~30-35) and doubled scenarios. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Good blind-spot scenario (quality issue mid-March). Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=32, P90=78. Wide and balanced. P10=32 perhaps overly pessimistic (pandemic-level), but P90=78 appropriate.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Methodical. Treated January weakness as "slightly lower central tendency" and "wider tails." Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~63 -> Output ~59.5, delta = -3.5. Reasonable small shift. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Discussed halved/doubled with appropriate reasoning. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements completed. Good blind-spot identification (engine clearing bunching). Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=38, P90=88. The most balanced distribution — appropriate central tendency with wide tails.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good evidence hierarchy. Uniquely identified "gliders" awaiting engines as upside mechanism. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~67 -> Output ~63, delta = -4. Reasonable modest shift. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good — discussed how horizon affects engine clearing probability. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. P90=95 justified by glider clearance scenario. Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=35, P90=95. Widest range. Central tendency (~63) is the most reasonable given recent March actuals.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured with clear hierarchy. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~57.5 -> Output ~51.5, delta = -6. **Large downward shift from an already conservative base.** Final median well below all recent March actuals. Score: 2/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All elements present. Good "engine breakthrough" blind spot. Score: 3/4

**Numeric assessment:** P10=35, P90=72. P90=72 barely matches March 2025 actual. Distribution too low overall.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final Median | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~63 | ~54 | -9 | 11/16 | Partial (direction right, magnitude excessive) |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~61.5 | ~59.5 | -2 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~63 | ~59.5 | -3.5 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~67 | ~63 | -4 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~57.5 | ~51.5 | -6 | 11/16 | Partial (excessive downward shift) |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):** Engaged meaningfully with received outside views. All produced moderate, well-balanced forecasts (medians 59.5-63). Cross-pollination effective.
- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** Both showed stronger downward adjustments (-9 and -6) and produced lower medians (54, 51.5). May have been less challenged by the received outside view.
- **Diversity impact:** Cross-pollination increased diversity and moderated the tendency toward overcorrection on January weakness. Cross-model instances clustered around 59.5-63 vs same-model instances at 51.5-54.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood resolution criteria and timeframe.
- All correctly assessed current status (January 2026 = 19, 2025 FY = 793, supply chain issues).

### Factual Consensus

1. January 2026 = 19 deliveries (confirmed by all)
2. 2025 full year = 793 deliveries (confirmed by all)
3. Deliveries are heavily backloaded toward Q4/December (all noted)
4. Supply chain constraints ongoing, especially engines (all noted)
5. Bernstein revised 2026 forecast to 865 vs consensus 910 (S2 instances)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | March 2025 = 63 | Actual was 71 (undervalued by 8 aircraft) | Medium — depressed base rate |
| S1-4 | March 2024 = 66 | Actual was 63 (minor error) | Low |
| S1-5 | March 2025 = 67 | Actual was 71 (undervalued by 4 aircraft) | Medium — depressed base rate |
| S1-3 | "Historical March average: 62" | Unsourced; not in research corpus | Low — plausible figure |

### Hallucinations

Both o3 instances presented specific month-by-month March delivery figures as sourced from "Airbus PDFs & press releases" when the research corpus only contained March 2023 = 61 as a verified data point. The remaining values came from model training data, with confirmed errors on March 2025. Presenting unverified training data as sourced facts is a mild hallucination.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. Strong analytical frameworks with structured source analysis and calibration logic across all forecasters
2. Good current-news integration — January 2026 weakness and Bernstein downgrade effectively incorporated
3. Appropriate uncertainty ranges in most forecasters, reflecting genuine unknowability
4. S2-4's "glider inventory" observation was a unique, differentiated insight
5. S1-4's 1:2:3 Q1 ratio methodology was the most sophisticated analytical approach

### Weaknesses
1. Critical research gap: pipeline failed to surface March 2025 (71), March 2024 (63), and Q1 2025 monthly breakdown
2. Both o3 instances hallucinated specific monthly figures and presented them as sourced data
3. Final median (~57) sits below all three recent March actuals (61, 63, 71) — systematic conservatism
4. S2-1 (P90=68) and S2-5 (P90=72) barely encompass recent March actuals, indicating overconfidence

### Overall Quality Grade

**This Forecast Grade: B-**

The analytical reasoning was generally sound and well-structured, but the High-severity research gap (missing the most relevant comparison data) combined with hallucinated historical data in two forecasters and resulting systematic downward bias prevent a full B grade. The final median of ~57 is defensible given January's weakness but likely underestimates March's seasonal recovery potential, given the established pattern where March consistently outperforms January by 2.5-3x (2025: 25 to 71, 2024: 30 to 63).

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add targeted queries for month-specific historical data: for "what will X deliver in month Y" questions, generate "Airbus deliveries [month] [year-1] [year-2]"
- Improve Agent PDF extraction capability or add fallback queries for recent monthly breakdowns
- Prioritize YoY monthly comparison data when the question asks about a specific future month

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Instruct forecasters to flag when historical data is from training vs. research: "Only cite specific numbers from the provided research. If recalling data from training, label it as unverified."
- Add calibration check: "Is your median above or below the most recent actual for this same month? If below, justify why."

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **o3:** Both instances hallucinated historical figures. Otherwise excellent methodology. Training-data reliance is a recurring risk.
- **Sonnet 4.5:** S2-1 showed excessive conservatism (median 54, P90=68). S2-2 with cross-pollination was much better balanced.
- **GPT-5.2:** Most balanced distribution overall. Good at maintaining appropriate uncertainty.

| Output spread >20% of range | Moderate | Median spread 51.5-63 (11.5 aircraft, ~8% of 150 range) |
| Update direction errors | No | All shifted down from outside view — directionally defensible |
| Factual errors present | Yes | S1-4 and S1-5 March 2025 values incorrect |
| Hallucinations detected | Yes | Both o3 instances presented training data as sourced |
| Cross-pollination effective | Yes | Cross-model instances produced more balanced forecasts |
| Critical info missed in research | Yes | March 2025=71, March 2024=63, Q1 2025 monthly breakdown |
| Base rate calculation errors | Partial | Base rates from hallucinated data underestimate true mean |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Partial | S2-5 (51.5) and S2-4 (63) are spread extremes |
