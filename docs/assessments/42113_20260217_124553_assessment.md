## Critical Issues Summary

**Complete this section FIRST after reading all artifacts. List the most significant problems that affected forecast quality.**

**Note:** Methodological diversity and forecast spread are NOT inherently issues. Only flag instances where reasoning is flawed, evidence is misinterpreted, or analytical tools are misapplied to the specific question.

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| S2-3 upward revision weakly justified | Low | S2-3 | GPT-5.2 moved from 9.7% to 10% with inside view evidence, citing bilateral progress as a moderate positive, but the new Tigray conflict news and continued absence of a 7th WP meeting should have more clearly dominated the update direction |
| No forecaster checked WTO accession page live | Low | Research | The question URL scraping captured the WTO accession page but only noted the 5th WP (March 2025); the 6th WP (Sep 2025) is not reflected on the page summary, suggesting the scrape may have been incomplete |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes / Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes / Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes / N/A |
| AskNews | No | Yes | N/A / Yes |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes / N/A |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "ethiopia wto accession timeline" (Google)
2. "ethiopia wto membership talks 2025" (Google News)
3. "Find official WTO working-party documents and statements from 2023-2026 on Ethiopia's accession progress, including meeting dates, draft schedules, and target of joining by MC14, plus analysis of remaining legislative steps in Ethiopia." (Agent)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "Ethiopia WTO accession status 2026" (Google)
2. "Ethiopia joins WTO February 2026" (Google News)
3. "Summarize developments between March 2025 and February 2026 regarding Ethiopia's bid to join the World Trade Organization, including any protocol signing, parliamentary ratification, or announced membership date." (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2023-2026 accession timeline and process | Late 2025 – Feb 2026 latest developments |
| Content type | WTO documents, working party proceedings, legislative requirements | News articles, bilateral protocols, conflict updates |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Detailed procedural chronology, legislative gap analysis | Brazil bilateral (Feb 2026), Tigray conflict (Feb 2026), latest government statements |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are well-differentiated. Historical queries successfully targeted the procedural chronology and remaining legislative requirements, while current queries surfaced recent bilateral developments and geopolitical context.
- The Agent report was particularly valuable, producing a comprehensive chronology of WTO Working Party meetings from 2024-2026 with specific document references (RD/ACC/12, WT/ACC/ETH/7/Rev.1) and a detailed analysis of remaining legislative steps (TRIPS, SPS, TBT, trade remedies, SOE disciplines, customs valuation).
- Historical queries effectively established the base rate context (38 completed out of 60 applications over 30 years) and Ethiopia's specific procedural position.
- Current queries surfaced critical information: the Ethiopia-Brazil bilateral protocol (Feb 3, 2026), the Ethiopia-China bilateral (Nov 2025), and the Tigray conflict escalation (Feb 17, 2026).
- Question URL scraping successfully captured both the WTO accession page and the March 2025 news release referenced in the question description.
- No critical information gaps: the absence of a scheduled 7th WP meeting (the most decision-relevant fact) was correctly identified through the absence of any announcement in recent sources.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remain appropriately factual. The Agent report includes an "Assessment of Ethiopia's timeline versus MC14 target" section that borders on forecasting ("ambitious but still plausible path"), but this is framed as analysis of feasibility rather than a probability estimate. The AskNews articles and Google results are factual news reporting. No inappropriate probability estimates appear in the research outputs.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Complete Working Party chronology (5th WP March 2025, 6th WP September 2025)
  - Bilateral protocol completions (China Nov 2025, Brazil Jan/Feb 2026)
  - Outstanding legislative requirements (TRIPS, SPS, TBT, trade remedies)
  - MC14 dates (March 25-29, 2026)
  - 30-day entry-into-force rule
  - Absence of scheduled 7th WP meeting
  - Tigray conflict escalation (Feb 17, 2026)

- **Critical information missed:**
  - No significant gaps identified. The research comprehensively covered the procedural, political, and geopolitical dimensions.

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Good quality. Surfaced official WTO sources, Ethiopian government statements, and independent analysis pieces. Successfully included the key Birr Metrics article reporting the 6th WP outcomes and January 2026 7th WP scheduling.
  - Agent report: Excellent. Produced the most valuable single research output with detailed chronology, document references, and legislative gap analysis. Well-sourced to WTO news releases.
  - AskNews articles: Good breadth but mixed relevance. Surfaced the critical Brazil bilateral signing (Feb 3, 2026), Tigray conflict news (Feb 17, 2026), and helpful context on China-Africa trade. Some articles (Russian WTO commentary, general AU summit coverage) were peripheral.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of all sources. Correctly categorized WTO official sources as high quality, Ethiopian government sources as medium-high with promotional tone, and opinion pieces as low reliability. Distinguished factual information from opinions effectively (e.g., noting Capital Ethiopia's advocacy journalism vs. factual reporting).
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified four reference classes: all WTO accessions (too broad), recent LDC accessions, accessions with announced MC targets, and Ethiopia's specific trajectory. Selected Ethiopia's own recent trajectory as most suitable. Reasonable but could have been more rigorous in deriving base rates from the chosen class.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 73 days remaining. Enumerated all six required procedural steps before May 1. Noted the critical path through MC14 (36-40 days away). Correctly identified the gap between "scheduled for early 2026" and no actual date.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Provided probability ranges conditional on scheduling status (25-35% if 7th WP were scheduled, lower without). Did not provide a clean numerical base rate from reference class but arrived at a reasonable estimate through reasoning.

*Binary-specific:*
- Derived 12% probability, considered both Yes and No pathways. Correctly identified the combination of no scheduled 7th WP meeting, substantial remaining work, and procedural requirements as the dominant No pathway.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive source-by-source evaluation with quality ratings. Good distinction between factual and opinion content. Correctly weighted Agent report highly. Identified nine distinct sources.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Considered four reference classes: recent LDC accessions (2015-2024), fast-track accessions, political-deadline-pressure accessions, and MC-specific targets. Selected recent LDC accessions combined with final-stage acceleration patterns. Good justification, though acknowledged limited data.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Excellent critical path analysis with specific procedural steps and timing constraints. Correctly identified the 30-day post-ratification waiting period as creating an absolute minimum timeline. Noted that even in best case, earliest accession would be late March/early April.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Provided a conditional probability chain: P(7th WP by Feb 28) × P(issues resolved) × P(GC approves at MC14) × P(ratification complete) = 0.30 × 0.40 × 0.70 × 0.60 = 5.0%. Added adjustments for political will (+2-3pp) and information uncertainty (+1-2pp). Mathematically sound and transparent.

*Binary-specific:*
- Derived 8% probability. Clear Yes/No pathway analysis. Final calibration in 7-10% range with centering at 8%.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Source-by-source evaluation with quality ratings. Good identification of the "two-gate" problem (WTO-side completion + Ethiopia-side ratification). Correctly noted that most sources reprise government aspirations rather than independent verification.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Innovative two-step reference class approach: (i) probability of approval by target MC, and (ii) conditional probability of completing ratification within the remaining window. Identified three candidate classes and selected appropriately. Noted the structural tightness of a 2.5-month window.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 73 days. Noted historical pattern that post-approval membership lag is typically months, not weeks. Identified the "gate" structure clearly.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Calibrated to "high single digits to low teens" based on reference class analysis. Final estimate of 9.7% is precise and well-justified. Acknowledged that the base rate for "eventually joins" (63%) is not time-appropriate.

*Binary-specific:*
- Derived 9.7% probability. Good consideration of both pathways. The precision (not rounding to 10%) suggests careful calibration.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient, focused analysis. Correctly distinguished WTO news releases and Agent report from secondary sources. Highlighted the key quote "substance, not deadlines, must drive the process" from WTO officials.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidate classes with clear pros/cons. Selected "accessions that had held 5-6 WP meetings but had not yet had a final WP meeting" as the closest procedural match. Provided specific historical comparisons (Timor-Leste, Comoros, Seychelles, Kazakhstan). Estimated median time from Draft WP Report to membership as 9 months. Strong historical grounding.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Noted minimum observed elapsed time from "no final WP yet" to membership was ~6 months (Kyrgyz Republic 1998, Oman 2000). Stated 2.4 months would be "unprecedented." Strong historical pattern analysis.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Raw base rate of ~0% from reference class, inflated to 2-3% for uncertainty and extraordinary political acceleration, plus 1pp for generic tail risk, arriving at ~4%. This is a rigorous, well-calibrated derivation with explicit adjustments.

*Binary-specific:*
- Derived 4% probability. Strong emphasis on the No pathway through procedural constraints. Appropriate skepticism about unprecedented compression.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Detailed source-by-source analysis with explicit quality ratings and fact-vs-opinion distinction. Identified nine specific sources. Correctly weighted WTO sources highest and opinion pieces lowest.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidate classes. Selected "accessions that had produced a Draft Working-Party Report and were aiming to sign at a specific Ministerial Conference" (~nine cases). Provided specific empirical features: median time from Draft WP Report to protocol adoption (~5 months), median time from adoption to membership (~6 months), fastest "adoption-to-membership" (Oman 2000: 61 days). Excellent historical grounding.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Detailed three-step analysis with specific timing requirements. Correctly identified the 30-day post-ratification waiting period and calculated that deposit must occur by ~April 1 for May 1 membership. Strong.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Base rate of ~5% from chosen reference class (1 accession out of ~19 comparable 3-month windows across nine examples). Applied offsetting adjustments: +2pp (political pressure), -3pp (no final WP meeting, ratification lag), -1pp (domestic conflict/fiscal), +1pp (possible emergency decree). Net: ~5%. Transparent, well-reasoned.

*Binary-specific:*
- Derived 5.0% probability. Explicit calibration against "upset frequency" in diplomatic processes. Retained 5% rather than adjusting for "unknown unknowns" because the bottleneck is mechanical (30-day rule), not political.

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 12% | 13/16 | Thorough source analysis with clear quality tiers | Base rate derivation less rigorous; no explicit conditional probability chain |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 8% | 15/16 | Transparent conditional probability chain (0.30×0.40×0.70×0.60) | Slightly generous probability for 7th WP by Feb 28 (30%) |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 9.7% | 14/16 | Innovative two-gate framework; precise calibration | Reference class analysis could have had more historical specifics |
| S1-4 | o3 | 4% | 15/16 | Strong historical grounding with specific accession timelines | Very concise; could have elaborated more on positive factors |
| S1-5 | o3 | 5% | 15/16 | Best historical reference class with specific empirical features | Minor: some historical examples (Latvia, Bahrain) not fully comparable |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Prediction |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | 12% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | 4% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | 8% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 9.7% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 5% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Correctly classified evidence into Strong/Moderate/Weak. Strong: procedural timeline critically tight (73 days, no 7th WP); WTO members' caution. Moderate: bilateral progress (China, Brazil), political commitment, remaining legislative work. Weak: opinion pieces, regional conflicts. Good framework application.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 12% → Output: 8%, Δ = -4pp). Decrease justified by the absence of a scheduled 7th WP meeting as the "decisive negative signal." Also noted that bilateral progress provides "slight upward pressure" but the missing meeting date provides "stronger downward pressure." Adjustment direction and magnitude appropriate.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed halving (to ~March 24, probability drops to 3-5%) and doubling (to ~July 12, probability increases to 35-45%). Good analysis demonstrating understanding of how the tight window constrains probability.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed all elements. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated (12%). Consistency check ("8 out of 100 times"). Top evidence pieces identified and verified. Blind-spot scenario considered (extraordinary expedited process, would raise to 25-30%). Status quo check confirms non-completion default.

*Binary-specific:*
- Update direction (downward) matches evidence direction (new negative signals dominate). Final 8% is internally consistent with reasoning that procedural hurdles are nearly prohibitive but not impossible.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Comprehensive evidence analysis with Strong/Moderate/Weak classification. Strong: structural/procedural constraint (73 days, multi-step critical path), multiple sources confirm March 2026 target but NO source indicates imminent completion. Moderate: Brazil bilateral signed Feb 3 shows progress but also indicates ongoing negotiations. Weak: government statements, military tensions.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 4% → Output: 4%, Δ = 0pp). Maintained the o3 base rate. Reasoning: "strong negative evidence (no 7th WP scheduled, ongoing bilaterals in Feb): -1%; Weak positive evidence (MC14 political window, government commitment): +1%; Net adjustment: 0%." This is defensible—the inside view evidence neither strongly confirmed nor refuted the base rate.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Excellent. Halved (37 days): ~1%, procedurally impossible. Doubled (148 days): ~15-20%, barely within historical precedent. Well-calibrated sensitivity analysis.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (4%). Consistency check ("4 out of 100 times"). Top evidence well-identified. Blind-spot: secret ultra-compressed timeline with unpublicized 7th WP meeting. Status quo check: non-membership default, low volatility.

*Binary-specific:*
- No update is justified given balanced evidence. Good recognition that Brazil bilateral (Feb 3) is actually a weak positive—it shows progress but also that negotiations are still ongoing.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Organized by strength level. Strong: structural 30-day rule, no confirmation WP concluded. Moderate: bilateral protocols (China, Brazil), MC14 political window, Ethiopia's parliament could act quickly. Weak: military tensions, government aspirational statements.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 9.7% → Output: 10%, Δ = +0.3pp). Slight upward revision. Reasoning: bilateral completions and high-level political push (+3pp), conflict risk (-1pp), net from outside view +2pp to inside view of 10%. The upward direction is weakly justified—the absence of a 7th WP meeting and the ongoing nature of bilaterals (Brazil signed just 2 weeks ago) should have more clearly pulled downward. However, the magnitude is very small.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Halved (36 days): drops sharply, "few accessions can clear final WP + approval + ratification + 30-day wait inside ~5 weeks." Doubled (146 days): "probability would rise materially, >50%"—this may be somewhat high.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase correct. Base rate stated (8%, referencing outside view). Key evidence items listed and vetted. Blind-spot: near-immediate final WP meeting plus coordinated "package close." Status quo check performed.

*Binary-specific:*
- Update direction (upward) is debatable. The new evidence (Brazil bilateral ongoing, Tigray conflict, still no 7th WP) is more negative than positive. However, the magnitude is negligible (+0.3pp) so the practical impact is minimal.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured. Correctly identified the 30-day rule as the hardest constraint. Used a chain-of-events model: P(WP finalizes in ~10 days) = 20%, P(GC/MC14 adopts) = 80%, P(parliament ratifies and deposits in ≤1 day) = 60%, P(30-day clock lands before May 1) = 50%. Product: 0.20 × 0.80 × 0.60 × 0.50 ≈ 4.8%. Added tail for earlier GC meeting to reach ~6%.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 9.7% → Output: 6%, Δ = -3.7pp). Clear downward revision. The chain-of-events model provides transparent justification for the decrease. The inside view evidence (bilateral closures, Tigray conflict, continued absence of WP meeting) correctly drives the estimate lower than the outside view.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed via the chain-of-events model. If window doubled, probability rises "dramatically (>50%)." If halved, "<2%." Good sensitivity analysis.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind-spot scenario: unpublicized intensive negotiations wrap up next week, special General Council mid-March, emergency decree for ratification—membership 29 April. Would add ~8-10pp. Status quo bias check: short horizon + procedural rigidity favor No.

*Binary-specific:*
- Excellent transparent chain-of-events model. Update direction (downward from 9.7% to 6%) well-justified. Each conditional probability in the chain is defensible.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Efficient, structured analysis. Strong: 30-day rule, no 7th WP scheduled. Moderate: bilateral protocols (China, Brazil), government/DG target statements. Weak: Tigray conflict, critic op-eds.
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 5% → Output: 4%, Δ = -1pp). Slight downward revision. Reasoning: downward pressures (mechanical timeline, unknown bilaterals with EU/US) outweigh upward pressures (bilateral closures, Secretariat upgrading draft). Net: 5% - 4pp + 3pp ≈ 4%. Transparent adjustment with explicit pp deltas.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Concise. Halved: "virtually zero; even the 30-day rule alone kills it." Doubled: "probability would rise appreciably (to perhaps 15-20%)." Appropriate.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Consistency check: "4 out of 100 times." Blind-spot: Ethiopia pre-negotiated parliamentary approval and deposits instrument same day protocol is signed at MC14. Status quo bias check performed.

*Binary-specific:*
- Small downward update (-1pp) is well-justified. Correctly identified the mechanical (non-political) nature of the 30-day constraint as making upsets rarer than in other domains.

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|

| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 8% (via S1-2) | 10% | +2pp | 13/16 | Partial (upward direction weakly justified) |
| S2-4 | o3 | 9.7% (via S1-3) | 6% | -3.7pp | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 5% | 4% | -1pp | 15/16 | Yes |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Did cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4) engage meaningfully with their received outside view?**
  - S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 ← o3's 4%): Maintained the o3 estimate. Engaged with it seriously, finding that inside view evidence balanced out rather than requiring adjustment. This is meaningful engagement—the forecaster didn't simply anchor but evaluated whether new evidence warranted a change.
  - S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← Sonnet 4.5's 8%): Moved slightly upward to 10%. Referenced the outside view base rate and made explicit adjustments. Engagement was meaningful but the upward direction was weakly justified.
  - S2-4 (o3 ← GPT-5.2's 9.7%): Decreased significantly to 6%. Applied a rigorous chain-of-events model that produced a lower estimate than the received input. Strong engagement with both the input and new evidence.

- **Did any over-weight or under-weight the cross-pollinated input?**
  - No instances of clear over- or under-weighting. All forecasters treated the received outside view as a starting point rather than an anchor.

- **Did same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5) behave differently than cross-model instances?**
  - S2-1 (self-model, Sonnet 4.5): Made a moderate -4pp adjustment. Similar behavior to cross-model instances.
  - S2-5 (self-model, o3): Made a small -1pp adjustment. Consistent with other o3 instances.
  - No systematic difference between same-model and cross-model behavior on this question.

- **Did cross-pollination increase or decrease diversity in final outputs?**
  - Cross-pollination slightly compressed diversity. S1 range was 4%–12% (8pp spread); S2 range was 4%–10% (6pp spread). The convergence toward 4-10% reflects genuine analytical consensus rather than artificial anchoring—all forecasters identified the same procedural constraints as decisive.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All five instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: Ethiopia must complete accession and be listed as a WTO member on the official accession page, with the effective date strictly before May 1, 2026.
- All correctly identified the forecast timeframe as 73 days (Feb 17 to May 1, 2026).
- All correctly assessed the current status: Ethiopia is still in accession negotiations, not yet a member. No forecaster erroneously stated or assumed accession had occurred.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Ethiopia's Working Party was established in 2003; the 5th WP meeting occurred March 19, 2025; the 6th WP meeting occurred September 26, 2025.
2. MC14 is scheduled for March 25-29, 2026 in Yaoundé, Cameroon.
3. The 7th (final) WP meeting has not been scheduled as of February 17, 2026.
4. WTO membership requires a 30-day entry-into-force period after deposit of the instrument of ratification.
5. Ethiopia signed bilateral market access protocols with China (November 2025) and Brazil (January/February 2026).
6. WTO members emphasized "substance over deadlines" at the 6th WP meeting.
7. Substantial legislative work remains on TRIPS, SPS, TBT, and trade remedies.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-2 | Minor ambiguity | States "Only 1 of ~14 bilateral negotiations fully completed (China, Nov 2025)" but Brazil bilateral was also completed (Feb 2026) | Low—S1 was based on historical context only; inside view corrected this |
| S2-3 | Minor | Suggests timeframe doubled probability would be ">50%"—likely too high given procedural constraints | Low—tangential to the core estimate |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinations detected across any output. All factual claims are traceable to the research sources. Specific dates, document references, and procedural details align with WTO official communications.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research quality**: The Agent report produced a comprehensive chronology with specific document references (RD/ACC/12, WT/ACC/ETH/7/Rev.1) and a detailed gap analysis of remaining legislative work. This was the standout research output.
2. **Strong analytical convergence**: All five forecasters independently identified the same three decisive constraints (no 7th WP meeting scheduled, 30-day entry-into-force rule, substantial remaining work) and arrived at a tight consensus (4%–10%).
3. **Rigorous calibration methods**: Multiple forecasters used transparent conditional probability chains (S1-2: 0.30×0.40×0.70×0.60; S2-4: 0.20×0.80×0.60×0.50) and explicit base-rate adjustments with directional reasoning. This is model-quality calibration.
4. **Good source discrimination**: All forecasters correctly distinguished official WTO sources from Ethiopian government promotional statements and opinion pieces, appropriately weighting each.

### Weaknesses
1. **S2-3 upward revision weakly justified**: The only output to increase its estimate in the inside view, despite new evidence (Tigray conflict, no 7th WP meeting) being more negative than positive. The magnitude was negligible (+0.3pp) but the direction was questionable.
2. **Limited exploration of "what would change my mind"**: While most forecasters included blind-spot scenarios, few explicitly stated what specific evidence would have pushed them above 20-30%.
3. **Minor template model mismatch**: The template lists S1-3/S2-3 as "o3-mini" but the actual model was GPT-5.2. This is a template issue, not a pipeline issue.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: [A-]**

The forecast demonstrates excellent research (particularly the Agent report), sound reasoning across all five forecasters, appropriate calibration in the low single-digit range, and no factual errors. The tight consensus (6pp spread) reflects genuine analytical agreement on the procedural constraints. The only notable weakness is S2-3's minor upward revision against the evidence direction, but this had negligible impact on the final aggregate.

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

- Consider adding a specific query for the WTO General Council schedule or calendar, which would provide direct evidence about whether a formal accession vote is planned.
- The Question URL scrape of the WTO accession page only reflected the 5th WP (March 2025), not the 6th WP (September 2025). This may indicate the page hadn't been updated or the scrape was incomplete. A more targeted scrape or a follow-up query could verify the page's current content.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

- The template model labels (S1-3 as "o3-mini") should be updated to reflect the current configuration (GPT-5.2) to avoid confusion in assessments.
- Consider adding a meta-analysis step that explicitly identifies the single most decision-relevant fact (in this case, the absence of a scheduled 7th WP meeting) and ensures all forecasters address it directly.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.5** (S1-1/S2-1, S1-2/S2-2): Produced the widest range of outside view estimates (8%–12%) but converged well in the inside view. Strong source analysis. S1-2's conditional probability chain was exemplary.
- **GPT-5.2** (S1-3/S2-3): Innovative two-gate framework in the outside view. The inside view upward revision was its weakest element—future prompting could emphasize that inside view evidence should update in the direction supported by the preponderance of new information.
- **o3** (S1-4/S2-4, S1-5/S2-5): Consistently the most calibrated model on this question, with the tightest estimates (4-6%) and strongest historical grounding. The chain-of-events model in S2-4 was the most transparent analytical method across all outputs.
