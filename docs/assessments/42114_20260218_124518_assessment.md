# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Ensemble anchoring on historical Aprils without adequate 2026 ramp-up weighting | Medium | S1-1, S1-2, S2-1, S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 instances anchor heavily on April 2022-2025 range (48-61) and apply only modest upward adjustments, producing medians of 55-60. This underweights the 2026 production ramp-up (793 → ~900-1000) and the structural capacity additions (two new A320 FALs). |
| Excessive weight on January 2026 weakness | Medium | S2-1, S2-2, S2-3 | Three forecasters treat Jan 2026 (19 deliveries) as a strong negative signal for April, but January is *always* the weakest month and is driven by holiday shutdowns and acceptance timing, not production capacity. April is structurally different. |
| Wide disagreement on upper tails across ensemble | Low | S2-4, S2-5 vs S2-1, S2-2 | o3 instances set P90 at 85-90 while Sonnet 4.5 instances set P90 at 72-75. The 15-18 unit gap in upper tails reflects fundamentally different views on whether 2026 ramp-up can manifest by April — a legitimate analytical divergence rather than an error. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (2 URLs) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "Airbus April 2025 deliveries" (Google)
2. "Airbus deliveries production ramp 2026" (Google News)
3. "Retrieve Airbus monthly deliveries dataset 2019-2025; highlight April figures; include 2026 guidance and supply-chain commentary" (Agent — 4 steps, 14+ sub-queries)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "Airbus January 2026 deliveries" (Google)
2. "Airbus deliveries 2026 outlook" (Google News)
3. AskNews query on Feb 2026 reporting for YTD deliveries, guidance, and supply-chain issues

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2019-2025 delivery history, esp. April figures | Jan 2026 actuals, Feb 2026 guidance, near-term outlook |
| Content type | Monthly delivery counts, annual totals, production targets | News articles, analyst forecasts, CEO statements |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent (multi-step) | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | April time-series (key reference class), 2026 guidance numbers | January 2026 weakness signal, up-to-date supply chain status |

**Analysis:**
- Excellent query discreteness — historical queries focused on building the April reference class while current queries targeted near-term signals.
- The Agent report was highly valuable, producing a comprehensive April time-series (2019: 70, 2020: 14, 2022: 48, 2023: 54, 2024: 61, 2025: 56) with source citations.
- Historical queries correctly targeted base rate establishment; current queries surfaced the critical January 2026 = 19 datapoint.
- FRED and yFinance were appropriately not used (not financial/economic data question).
- **Gap:** No queries specifically targeted Airbus 2026 guidance from the Feb 19 earnings call (which happens the day after the forecast). This is timing-driven, not a query design flaw.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report appropriately stayed factual — it compiled delivery data and guidance numbers without offering probability estimates. Article summaries correctly reported analyst forecasts (IBA: 900, consensus: 913) as third-party opinions without the research pipeline itself forecasting. Clean separation maintained.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Complete April delivery time-series 2022-2025 (48, 54, 61, 56)
  - January 2026 = 19 deliveries (slowest decade start)
  - 2025 full year = 793 deliveries
  - 2026 targets: ~1,000 (Airbus), 913 (consensus), 890 (Berenberg), ~900 (IBA)
  - Back-end loading: December 2025 = 136 (17% of annual)
  - Supply chain: engine shortages, fuselage panel issues, A220 delays
  - Two new A320 final assembly lines opened in 2025

- **Critical information missed:**
  - April 2021 delivery figure (never located — minor gap since 2022-2025 is sufficient)
  - Monthly breakdown for 2025 beyond January and December (would have helped calibrate seasonality)

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: High quality — Aviation Week, Seattle Times, CNBC, AeroTime all credible
  - Agent report: Excellent — 4-step agentic search produced a well-sourced monthly delivery table with 14+ sub-queries
  - AskNews articles: Mixed — many tangential results (India backlog, helicopter assembly, stock prices) but some relevant (supply chain strains article, 2025 delivery reporting)
  - Question URL scraping: Useful — pulled January 2026 data directly from Airbus Orders & Deliveries pages

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough evaluation of each source with quality ratings. Correctly distinguished factual data from expert opinions. Identified Aviation Week's narrowbody-only limitation. Score: 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three reference classes and selected April deliveries 2019-2025 (ex-2020). Good but could have considered the "April as % of annual total" class more seriously. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 6-week horizon. Good observation about seasonal patterns and back-end loading. Noted January weakness vs historical April patterns. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Mean of 58 from April series (ex-2020). Reasonable but somewhat conservative — the 2026 ramp-up factor was acknowledged but treated as "execution risk" rather than incorporated into the base rate. Score: 3/4

*Numeric-specific:* Central estimate of 58-60 is well-justified from the reference class. Range 42-75 is reasonable but the upper tail at 75 may be too tight given 2026 ambitions.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Comprehensive, with clear identification of expert opinions from named Airbus executives. Good separation of factual data from opinions. Score: 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Selected April 2019-2025 as primary class. Noted the 2022-2025 post-COVID range of 48-61 as the relevant sub-class. Good analysis. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly noted 72 days, April as 6-8% of annual deliveries. Good analysis of seasonal back-end loading. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Centered on 60-65, which is slightly more forward-looking than S1-1. Derived from both historical April average and proportional scaling of analyst consensus (913 × 7.2% = 66). Score: 3/4

*Numeric-specific:* Distribution 45-78 is wider than S1-1, especially on the upper end (78 vs 75). Better reflects uncertainty from the production ramp-up.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient and focused. Correctly rated Airbus official data as highest quality, treated agent report as "primary-derived." Good skepticism about Air Data News as "medium-low to medium." Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three candidate classes and chose April 2022-2025 as primary, with broader set for tail calibration. Thoughtful approach to using different classes for center vs. tails. Score: 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated ~75 days. Good observation that recent Aprils cluster in high-40s to low-60s with rare regime breaks. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Centered on mid-to-high 50s with modest upward tilt to ~60 median. Acknowledged back-end loading limits upside. Wide 10-90 range (38-85) is the widest of the ensemble — appropriately uncertain. Score: 3/4

*Numeric-specific:* The 38-85 range is the most appropriately wide in the ensemble. The lower bound of 38 accounts for more severe supply disruptions than other forecasters considered.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Systematic analysis with clear quality ratings. Treated April delivery series as "approximately correct and directionally robust." Good note about Aviation Week paywall truncation. Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified three classes including "April as % of annual total" approach, which is more analytically sophisticated. Used 930 × 7.7% = 72 as the point estimate — the highest in the ensemble. Score: 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 75 days. Good observation about short lead-time reducing variance. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Centered on 65-70 using the "annual target × April share" methodology. This is analytically stronger than pure historical anchoring because it incorporates the 2026 ramp-up. Upper tail at 88 is reasonable. Score: 4/4

*Numeric-specific:* The 45-88 range reflects a more forward-looking distribution. The 72 central estimate from the % of annual methodology is arguably the most analytically rigorous approach.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and efficient. Correctly identified key sources and their reliability levels. Score: 3/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Used April 2022-2025 mean of 55 with interpolated 2021 estimate (~45). Slightly unusual to include an interpolated value. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Brief but correct. Noted 75-day horizon and back-end loading pattern. Score: 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Centered on 62, using 2025 (56) as modal anchor with upward drift. Set wide P90 at 85. Good calibration. Score: 3/4

*Numeric-specific:* Distribution 45-85 is similar to S1-4. The 62 center is a reasonable compromise between historical average and ramp-up expectations.

- **Score:** 12/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (median) | P10-P90 | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|---------------------|---------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~58-60 | 42-75 | 13/16 | Thorough source analysis | Conservative upper tail |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~60-65 | 45-78 | 13/16 | Good % of annual methodology | Could've weighted ramp-up more |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~60 | 38-85 | 13/16 | Widest uncertainty range, best tail calibration | Center slightly conservative |
| S1-4 | o3 | ~65-70 | 45-88 | 14/16 | Best analytical methodology (annual × April share) | Interpolated 2021 data questionable |
| S1-5 | o3 | ~62 | 45-85 | 12/16 | Good balance of history and ramp-up | Analysis somewhat brief |

---

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input Median |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model, Sonnet 4.5) | ~58-60 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~65-70 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~60-65 |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ~60 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model, o3) | ~62 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied correctly. Identified January weakness as strong evidence, CEO statements as moderate, new assembly lines as weak. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~58-60 → Output P50 ~58.5 (P10: 42, P90: 72). Delta ≈ -1 from outside view median. Adjusted downward due to January weakness. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis of halved/doubled timeframe impacts. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Correctly identified blind spots (supply chain breakthrough vs. quality issue). Status quo assessment reasonable. Score: 3/4

*Numeric-specific:* The P90 dropped from 75 (outside) to 72 (inside), which is a modest compression. The justification (January weakness) is reasonable but possibly over-weighted.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good application of framework. Correctly identified January 2026 weakness as most significant new evidence. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~65-70 (from o3's S1-4) → Output P50 ~55 (P10: 42, P90: 75). Delta ≈ -12 from received outside view. **This is a large downward shift** — S2-2 essentially rejected the o3 outside view and reverted to Sonnet 4.5's natural prior. Score: 2/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis including halved/doubled timeframe scenarios. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Thorough. Good blind spot identification. Score: 3/4

*Numeric-specific:* The massive downward shift from S1-4's base rate to a median of ~55 suggests S2-2 did not meaningfully engage with the cross-pollinated input. It essentially overrode the o3 outside view with its own preference for anchoring on April 2025 (56).

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured. Identified January weakness and CEO engine comments as key. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~60-65 (from Sonnet 4.5's S1-2) → Output P50 ~61.5 (P10: 42, P90: 80). Delta ≈ 0 to -2 from received outside view. Reasonable stability given mixed signals. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with appropriate detail. Score: 3/4

*Numeric-specific:* Maintained a wider P90 (80) than both Sonnet 4.5 instances, showing better appreciation for upside scenarios. Good balance.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Applied strong/moderate/weak framework. Correctly weighted January weakness and engine issues. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~60 (from GPT-5.2's S1-3) → Output P50 ~62 (P10: 35, P90: 90). Delta ≈ +2, modest upward shift. Wider tails than input. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Concise but appropriate. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Good blind spot about "glider" inventory clearing. Score: 3/4

*Numeric-specific:* The P10 of 35 and P90 of 90 give the widest range in the ensemble. The P90 of 90 represents a scenario where ~9.8% of a 900-jet year falls in April — plausible but aggressive.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Systematic. Used April share of annual (7.7%) as structural evidence. Identified analyst consensus of ~880-900 as moderate. Score: 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input ~62 (from S1-5 self) → Output P50 ~62 (P10: 42, P90: 88). Delta ≈ 0. Maintained center while slightly widening tails. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good. Noted production lead-times >4 weeks are largely baked in. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete and well-structured. Good percentage-of-annual reasoning at each percentile level. Score: 4/4

*Numeric-specific:* The percentile-by-percentile annotation with April share percentages (4.7% to 9.8%) is analytically excellent and makes the distribution interpretable.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final P50 | P10-P90 | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (~58-60) | ~58.5 | 42-72 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (~65-70) | ~55 | 42-75 | 11/16 | Partial — overly large downward shift from o3 input |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (~60-65) | ~61.5 | 42-80 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (~60) | ~62 | 35-90 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (~62) | ~62 | 42-88 | 14/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.5 ← o3 S1-4):** Poor engagement. Received an outside view centered on ~65-70 from o3 but shifted all the way down to ~55, essentially ignoring the cross-pollinated input. The January weakness was used as justification, but this represents the model reverting to its own prior rather than genuinely integrating the alternative perspective.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← Sonnet 4.5 S1-2):** Moderate engagement. Received ~60-65 input and produced ~61.5 — stayed close to the input while making its own small adjustments. Reasonable integration.

- **S2-4 (o3 ← GPT-5.2 S1-3):** Good engagement. Received ~60 from GPT-5.2 and produced ~62 with wider tails. Took the GPT-5.2 center seriously while adding its own wider uncertainty bounds.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** Both produced sensible continuations of their own outside views. S2-1 stayed at ~58.5 (from ~58-60 input), S2-5 stayed at ~62 (from ~62 input).

- **Net effect on diversity:** Cross-pollination slightly *reduced* diversity because S2-2 pulled dramatically away from its o3 input back toward the Sonnet 4.5 cluster. The ensemble would have benefited if S2-2 had maintained more of the higher o3 estimate.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood this as a single-month delivery count for April 2026.
- All correctly identified the Airbus Orders & Deliveries page as the resolution source.
- All correctly assessed the forecast window (~72 days).

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. January 2026 deliveries = 19 (confirmed across all 5 instances)
2. 2025 full year = 793 deliveries (universal)
3. April 2025 = 56 deliveries (universal)
4. Recent April range 2022-2025 = 48-61 (universal)
5. 2026 delivery targets: ~1,000 (Airbus), 913 (consensus) (universal)
6. Back-end loading pattern (December 2025 = 136, 17% of annual) (universal)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-5 | Minor | Interpolated April 2021 as ~45 without evidence | Low — used for reference class, not critical |
| S1-1 | Ambiguous | Stated January 2026 (19) is "below 2025's 25" — correct, but implied this is unusual without noting January is always lowest month | Low |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinated facts, dates, events, or sources detected. All key data points are traceable to the research artifacts.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent research pipeline:** The agentic search produced a high-quality April time-series with source citations — the key analytical foundation for this forecast.
2. **Consistent factual accuracy:** All 5 forecasters correctly identified the same key data points and showed no hallucinations.
3. **o3 analytical sophistication:** S1-4 and S2-5 used the "annual target × April share percentage" methodology, which is more analytically rigorous than pure historical anchoring and better incorporates the 2026 ramp-up story.

### Weaknesses
1. **Sonnet 4.5 anchoring bias:** Both Sonnet instances anchored on the April 2022-2025 historical range (48-61) without adequately incorporating the 2026 production ramp-up. This pulled the ensemble median down.
2. **January over-weighting:** Multiple forecasters treated January 2026 (19 deliveries) as a strong negative signal, but January is structurally the weakest month due to holiday shutdowns and acceptance timing. It is weakly predictive of April.
3. **Cross-pollination failure in S2-2:** When Sonnet 4.5 received the o3 outside view (~65-70), it largely rejected it, reverting to its own lower estimate. This undermined the diversity benefit of cross-pollination.

### Why the Forecast May Be Lower Than the Market Median

Your specific question: your median is 59 vs. the bot market median of 63.3, with a tighter and lower IQR.

**Hypothesis for the gap:**

1. **Historical anchoring vs. forward-looking scaling:** Your ensemble (especially the two Sonnet 4.5 instances) anchored on the April 2022-2025 mean (~55) and applied only modest upward adjustments. Other bots may have more aggressively applied the 2026 ramp-up factor. If Airbus delivers ~900 aircraft in 2026 (analyst consensus), April at 7-8% share would be 63-72 — right where the market median sits. Your forecast implicitly assumes April 2026 will look like April 2025, rather than reflecting the ~15% year-over-year increase Airbus is targeting.

2. **Over-weighting January weakness:** Three of your five forecasters cite January 2026 (19 deliveries) as a major bearish signal. But January is always the weakest month — Jan 2025 was 25, Jan 2024 was 30. The January figure is driven by holiday shutdowns and acceptance scheduling, not production capacity. Other bots may correctly treat this as noise rather than signal.

3. **Sonnet 4.5 conservative bias on numeric questions:** Both Sonnet instances produced lower medians (~55-58) than the o3 instances (~62). When averaged equally, the two Sonnet outputs drag the aggregate down. This is a structural feature of your ensemble: 2/5 forecasters are the most conservative model, and cross-pollination failed to correct this when S2-2 rejected the o3 input.

4. **Tighter IQR from compressed upper tails:** Your Sonnet instances set P90 at 72-75, while the o3 instances set P90 at 85-90. The final aggregated P90 (89) is driven by the o3 instances, but the P75 (69.5) is compressed by the Sonnet inputs. The market may be reflecting more upside risk from potential "glider" clearing (dozens of engineless aircraft could be delivered rapidly once engines arrive).

5. **Missing the Feb 19 earnings guidance:** The forecast was made on Feb 18, one day before Airbus's FY2025 earnings and 2026 guidance release. Other bots may have forecasted after this release and incorporated the official 2026 delivery target, which could have anchored their forecasts higher.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

Good research quality and factual accuracy throughout, with analytically strong contributions from the o3 instances. The grade is held back by: (1) Sonnet 4.5 anchoring bias producing a lower-than-optimal central estimate, (2) cross-pollination failure in S2-2, and (3) excessive January-weighting across multiple forecasters.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- For manufacturing/delivery questions, prioritize monthly seasonal pattern data (full 12-month breakdown for at least 2-3 recent years) rather than just the target month.
- Add a query specifically targeting analyst monthly forecasts or production rate estimates, not just annual totals.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Consider adding a "structural break" prompt element that explicitly asks forecasters: "Is this year expected to be fundamentally different from recent years? If so, how should the reference class be adjusted?" This could counteract the anchoring-on-history bias.
- The January datapoint should be contextualized in the prompt — the research pipeline could note that January is structurally the weakest month (always <30 in recent years) to prevent forecasters from over-weighting it.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Tends to anchor conservatively on historical data without adequate adjustment for known structural changes (ramp-up targets, new capacity). Both instances produced the lowest medians.
- **o3:** Produced the most analytically sophisticated analyses (annual × monthly share methodology, percentile-by-share annotation). However, S1-4 had the widest absolute range, contributing to ensemble uncertainty.
- **GPT-5.2:** Solid middle ground. Good engagement with cross-pollinated input. Reasonable calibration.
