## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Aggregated p90 inflated to 6.016 | Medium | Aggregation | The aggregated 90th percentile (6.016%) is far above any individual forecaster's p90 (max 5.95% from F4). This is a CDF-averaging artifact that creates fatter right tails than any single forecaster intended, potentially distorting the submission. |
| F4 distribution inconsistent with consensus | Medium | S2-4 | Forecaster 4 (o3) produced a 60 bp p10-p90 range (5.35-5.95%), roughly double that of F1 and F5, despite all forecasters agreeing on a low-volatility regime. The wide tails pull the aggregate distribution outward. |
| Agent report includes forward-looking analysis | Low | Research | The Agent report section "Implications for forecasting 2026-02-26 value" goes beyond factual data retrieval to offer directional predictions, which should remain the forecasters' domain. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Partial (hit API limit) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | Yes |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not applicable) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No (not applicable) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent, FRED):
1. "OBMMI VA 30-year index history" (Google)
2. "VA mortgage rates Optimal Blue update" (Google News)
3. "Retrieve FRED series OBMMIVA30YF daily values for past two years and summarize trend, mean, volatility; highlight last 30 days" (Agent)
4. "OBMMIVA30YF" (FRED)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "OBMMI VA 30-year rate" (Google)
2. "30-Year VA mortgage rate trend" (Google News)
3. "Provide recent (past month) U.S. articles discussing changes in the Optimal Blue 30-year fixed Veterans Affairs mortgage index and forecasts through late February 2026." (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2-year history through Feb 12, 2026 | Last few days/weeks of Feb 2026 |
| Content type | Statistical data, methodology, trend narrative | Expert polls, rate snapshots, market commentary |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent, FRED | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Base rate data, volatility estimates, historical context | Near-term directional signals, expert consensus |

**Analysis:**
- Good discreteness between query sets. Historical queries properly targeted base rate establishment (FRED data retrieval, trend analysis), while current queries sought near-term directional signals.
- The Agent query was well-crafted and produced an excellent comprehensive statistical summary including 30-day volatility, trend narrative, and recent daily values.
- FRED integration directly retrieved the target series, providing authoritative recent values.
- The AskNews query hit an API limit ("ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded"), but the deep research failed gracefully. The main AskNews results still returned 16 articles, though most were about general mortgage rates rather than VA-specific OBMMI data.
- Critical information gap: No Treasury yield or MBS spread data was retrieved, which would have helped calibrate the relationship between broader rate movements and VA-specific rates.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report includes a section "5. Implications for forecasting 2026-02-26 value" that states the index "suggests further--but modest--downside potential before month-end." This crosses the line from factual reporting into forecasting. Research outputs should remain purely informational. However, the impact is low since forecasters independently derived their own views.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Latest FRED observation: 5.633% on 2026-02-12
  - Two-year statistical profile (mean 6.05%, σ 0.32pp, current low)
  - 30-day volatility: 0.038pp (exceptionally low)
  - Bankrate expert poll: 55% flat, 27% down, 18% up
  - Optimal Blue January report: VA rate 5.64%, refinance surge
  - Recent daily values showing 5.63-5.74% range
- **Critical information missed:**
  - Treasury yield data (10-year, 2-year) for the forecast period
  - MBS spread dynamics (primary-secondary spread)
  - Any scheduled economic data releases between Feb 17-26 (notably, PCE on Feb 26 was identified by one forecaster but not in research)
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Good mix of Forbes daily rate articles, Bankrate expert survey, Fortune historical context. Some older articles (Oct-Dec 2025) of limited relevance.
  - Agent report: Excellent. Comprehensive statistical analysis of the FRED series with daily values, descriptive stats, and trend narrative.
  - AskNews articles: Mixed. Many articles on general conforming rates rather than VA-specific. UK and South Korean mortgage articles were irrelevant noise. Deep research hit API limit.
  - FRED data: Authoritative. Provided the exact series with recent values and historical statistics.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough coverage of all sources with quality ratings (Authoritative/High/Medium/Low). Correctly identified the TradingView page as wrong series. Properly noted dates relative to forecast opening. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Selected "14-day rolling changes in OBMMIVA30YF" as primary reference class, which is appropriate. Identified 3 alternatives and explained why 14-day was best. However, didn't compute formal distributional statistics from the reference class. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 9 calendar days / 6-7 trading days. Good analysis of historical daily movement ranges, seasonal considerations, and no Fed meetings. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchored to 5.63% (latest) and 5.70% (30-day mean). Derived central estimate of 5.65-5.72% with reasoning about support levels and mean reversion. Sound but qualitative rather than quantitative. (3/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Central estimate (p50 ~5.68%) reasonable given recent data
- Distribution shape: slightly right-skewed as justified
- Range: p10=5.55 to p90=5.82 (27 bp spread) - tight but appropriate for low-vol regime

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5)

- **Source Analysis:** Well-organized, similar coverage to S1-1. Correctly identified Send2Press article as "most recent and relevant source." (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** "Daily VA mortgage rate movements over 10-14 day forward-looking windows during low-volatility regimes." Good selection with explicit regime conditioning. Evaluated 3 alternatives. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Computed as "14 days (Feb 17 to Feb 26)" - slightly overestimates the horizon since the question resolves on the value for Feb 26, not Feb 17+14 days. Minor imprecision. Correct observations about no catalysts. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** "Base case 5.60-5.75%, centered near 5.67%." Clear scenario analysis (downside/base/upside). Distribution slightly wider than S1-1 reflecting less certainty about mean reversion. (3/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Central estimate (p50 ~5.67%) consistent with S1-1
- Range: p10=5.52 to p90=5.83 (31 bp) - appropriate
- Asymmetry well-justified

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Best source analysis in the ensemble. Explicitly distinguished facts from opinions for every source. Correctly identified LSEG content as "vendor/promotional." Appropriately cautious about the Agent report ("computed summary, not authoritative data"). (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified "forward 1-2 week changes in OBMMIVA30YF" as best match. Considered related indices and unconditional distribution as alternatives. Good reasoning about why full-history is too broad. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 9 calendar days / ~7 trading days. Strong insight about macro announcement risk requiring fat tails (±30-50 bp should retain "meaningful tail mass"). (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Center in "mid-to-high 5.6s / low 5.7s" with asymmetric tails. Distribution wider than Sonnet models (p10=5.40, p90=5.98) reflecting honest uncertainty about tail risks. (3/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Widest distribution in the ensemble (p10-p90: 58 bp)
- Appropriately accounts for macro tail risk that other forecasters underweight
- Central estimate (p50 ~5.68%) consistent with consensus

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise and efficient. Correctly identified that only FRED + the Feb 10 Optimal Blue report provide "timely, quantitative information." (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent quantitative approach. Computed empirical 10-business-day change distribution (n ≈ 1,800): mean -0.6 bp, σ = 9.3 bp, 10th/90th = ±18 bp. Best reference class derivation in the ensemble. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified ~10 business days. Good detail on macro factors. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Mathematically rigorous: N(μ=5.613%, σ=0.093%), inflated σ 25% for fat tails → σ ≈ 0.116%. Clear calculation chain from reference class to percentiles. (4/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Central estimate (p50 ~5.62%) slightly lower than Sonnet outputs, driven by -2bp drift assumption
- Range: p10=5.45 to p90=5.78 (33 bp)
- Strong quantitative foundation

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Efficient, relevance-focused. Concise but accurate characterization of each source. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Used "daily 10-day-ahead changes over the last two years" with specific empirical statistics: mean -3.8 bp, σ = 8.6 bp, 10th/90th = -15/+9 bp. Notes slight left skew. Second-best quantitative approach. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identified 7 business days. Good catalog of scheduled events (no FOMC, CPI already out, Treasury auctions 18-19 Feb). (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** N(μ=5.59%, σ=0.10%), inflated σ 10% for unknown-unknowns. Clear mathematical derivation with explicit percentile calculations. (4/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Tightest distribution in the ensemble (p10=5.46, p90=5.72, range 26 bp)
- Lowest central estimate (p50 ~5.59%), driven by larger -3.8bp drift assumption
- Methodologically sound but may understate upside tail risk

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (median) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~5.68% [5.55, 5.82] | 12/16 | Clear scenario analysis with support/resistance levels | Qualitative rather than quantitative derivation |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (median, [p10, p90]) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-1 (self-model) | ~5.68% [5.55, 5.82] |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | S1-4 (o3) | ~5.62% [5.45, 5.78] |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.5) | ~5.67% [5.52, 5.83] |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | ~5.68% [5.40, 5.98] |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | ~5.59% [5.46, 5.72] |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly classified FRED data and low volatility as Strong, expert poll and 30-day mean as Moderate, Fed policy as Weak. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input median ~5.68% → Output median ~5.67% (Δ = -1 bp). Shift justified by anchoring to more recent 5.633% value while acknowledging mean reversion. Tails narrowed slightly (10th: 5.55→5.57, 90th: 5.82→5.80). (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good discussion: halved → tighter (5.64-5.68%), doubled → wider (5.55-5.85%). Correct directional analysis. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 7 elements completed meaningfully. Blind spot identified (hawkish Fed communication). Sensitivity check performed. (4/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Update direction and magnitude appropriate: very small shifts justified by close alignment between base rate and current data
- Distribution remains well-calibrated for the 9-day horizon
- Tails reasonable

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.5): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured. Properly noted that S1-4's empirical σ=9.3bp is strongest anchor. Added inflation data (Core CPI 2.5% YoY) as moderate evidence. Identified mortgage-Treasury spread widening (per expert Ken Johnson) as potential factor. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input median ~5.62% → Output median ~5.63% (Δ = +1 bp). Adjusted σ from 11.6bp to ~10bp for shorter horizon (6-7 vs 10 business days). Reasonable. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis with specific σ scaling. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind spot identified (geopolitical shock or data surprise). (3/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Appropriately recalibrated σ for shorter horizon
- Central estimate nearly unchanged from S1-4 input, which is reasonable
- Range (5.50-5.76) moderately tight

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Reasonable categorization. Identified status-quo anchoring + low volatility as Strong. Near-term trackers showing decline as Moderate. Expert polls as Weak. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input median ~5.67% → Output median ~5.66% (Δ = -1 bp). Nudged slightly downward with wider tails, especially on upside (p90: 5.83→5.90). The wider right tail is justified by "snapback" risk near a local low. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but present. Noted halved/doubled horizon effects. (2/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete but somewhat perfunctory. Blind spot: Treasury selloff / MBS spread widening. (3/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Distribution (5.50-5.90, range 40 bp) reflects appropriate uncertainty for the question type
- Slight right skew correctly captures asymmetric risk at cyclical low
- Maintained wider tails from S1-3 input, which is reasonable cross-pollination behavior

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Efficient Strong/Moderate/Weak categorization. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input median ~5.68% → Output median ~5.63% (Δ = -5 bp). The -8bp nudge from the outside view is justified ("continued gentle easing"), but the resulting distribution is the widest in the ensemble (5.35-5.95, range 60 bp). The 10th percentile at 5.35% implies a -28bp move from the latest print, which would be historically unusual in the current low-vol regime. (2/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Very brief. (2/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Identified PCE on Feb 26 as blind spot - the only forecaster to flag this specific event. (3/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Central estimate (5.63%) reasonable but tails too wide
- p10 of 5.35% implies a 3σ move given recent 30-day volatility (0.038pp) - inconsistent with low-vol narrative
- p90 of 5.95% also excessive for a 9-day window
- This forecaster drives the aggregated distribution's fat tails

- **Score:** 10/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good structure. Identified FRED σ and latest print as Strong. Forbes/Bankrate as Moderate. Older articles as Weak. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input median ~5.59% → Output median ~5.60% (Δ = +1 bp). Nudged mean up to 5.60%, reasoning that some of the recent decline may already be reflected in unpublished FRED prints. Tightened σ from 10bp to 9bp. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Brief but proportional. σ scaling by √(days) mentioned. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Identified surprise Treasury yield jump as blind spot. (3/4)

**Numeric assessment:**
- Tightest distribution in the ensemble (5.45-5.75, range 30 bp)
- Central estimate (5.60%) slightly below consensus but well-justified
- Distribution consistent with the low-vol narrative

- **Score:** 12/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input (median) | Final (median) | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|-------------------|----------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~5.68% | ~5.67% | -1 bp | 13/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.5 | ~5.62% | ~5.63% | +1 bp | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | ~5.67% | ~5.66% | -1 bp | 11/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | ~5.68% | ~5.63% | -5 bp | 10/16 | Partial |
| S2-5 | o3 | ~5.59% | ~5.60% | +1 bp | 12/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):** All engaged meaningfully with their received outside views. S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's quantitative analysis) appropriately adopted the empirical σ-based approach while adjusting for shorter horizon. S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet's qualitative view) maintained its wider tails from S1-3 while incorporating the more structured Sonnet base rate. S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's wide distribution) narrowed the center but preserved wide tails, showing partial integration.
- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** Both made minimal updates from their respective outside views, consistent with self-model reinforcement. S2-1 made the smallest adjustment (-1bp), while S2-5 also moved marginally.
- **Diversity impact:** Cross-pollination preserved a healthy spread: medians ranged from 5.60% to 5.67% (7 bp). The main diversity manifests in tail width: S2-4 (60bp range) vs S2-5 (30bp range). This variation is useful for the ensemble since it captures both "low-vol" and "macro-shock-possible" views.
- **Overall effectiveness:** Moderate. Cross-pollination influenced distribution width more than central tendency. The cross-model instances showed clear engagement with received inputs rather than ignoring them.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: the FRED API value for OBMMIVA30YF on or near 2026-02-26.
- All correctly identified the forecast timeframe as 9 calendar days / ~7 trading days.
- All correctly assessed the current state: latest value 5.633% on Feb 12, 2026 (two-year low), in a downtrend from Oct 2024 peak of 6.97%.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Latest OBMMIVA30YF value: 5.633% on 2026-02-12 (all 5)
2. Recent 30-day trading range: 5.63-5.76% (all 5)
3. Low recent volatility (30-day σ ~0.038pp) vs higher 2-year norm (all 5)
4. Fed easing cycle ongoing, no FOMC meeting before Feb 26 (all 5)
5. January Optimal Blue report showed VA rate at 5.64% (4 of 5)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Unverifiable statistics | Claims "n ≈ 1,800 overlapping windows" with specific σ=9.3bp - these numbers appear computed but cannot be independently verified from the artifacts | Low |
| S1-5 | Unverifiable statistics | Claims "mean 10-day change: -3.8 bp, σ = 8.6bp" - same concern as S1-4 | Low |
| S2-4 | PCE date claim | Claims "PCE due morning of 26 Feb" - this is plausible but not confirmed in any research source | Low |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. The empirical statistics cited by S1-4 and S1-5 (10-day σ, change distributions) are plausible and consistent with each other, though they cannot be directly verified from the research artifacts. These appear to be computations from the FRED data rather than fabricated claims.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent data retrieval:** The Agent search produced a comprehensive 2-year statistical summary of the FRED series including daily values, trend narrative, and volatility analysis. The FRED integration provided authoritative current values.
2. **Strong reference class reasoning:** Multiple forecasters (especially S1-4, S1-5) applied rigorous quantitative methods using empirical 10-day change distributions, moving beyond qualitative "rates will probably stay similar" reasoning.
3. **Appropriate anchoring:** All forecasters anchored to the latest FRED observation (5.633%) and recognized the low-volatility regime, producing a tight consensus in central estimates (5.60-5.67%).
4. **Good current information integration:** Bankrate expert poll, Forbes daily rates, and Optimal Blue January report were all identified and weighted appropriately.

### Weaknesses
1. **Aggregated tail distortion:** The CDF-averaging method produced a p90 of 6.016% when no individual forecaster exceeded 5.95%. This 42bp inflation in the right tail is a meaningful artifact that may hurt scoring.
2. **Inconsistent tail calibration across forecasters:** The 2x difference in p10-p90 range between F4 (60bp) and F5 (30bp) -- both o3 models -- suggests the tail calibration isn't driven by well-grounded reasoning in at least one case.
3. **Missing macroeconomic context in research:** No Treasury yield data, MBS spread data, or economic calendar was systematically retrieved, leaving forecasters to rely on LLM knowledge for macro factors.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| **B+** | **Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling** |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The forecast demonstrates strong research quality (especially the Agent-driven FRED analysis), sound reference-class reasoning across the ensemble, and appropriate central estimates. The B+ rather than A- reflects the aggregated distribution's inflated right tail and the inconsistency in tail calibration between same-model forecasters (F4 vs F5).

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add explicit Treasury yield (10-year, 2-year) retrieval to the research pipeline for interest-rate questions, either via FRED or a financial data source. This would help forecasters calibrate the macro-rate relationship.
- Include an economic calendar query to identify scheduled data releases in the forecast window (CPI, PCE, jobs reports, Fed speeches).
- Consider adding a dedicated MBS spread query for mortgage-rate questions.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- The Agent report should be instructed to avoid forward-looking analysis sections. Its role should be purely data retrieval and statistical summary.
- Consider whether the CDF-averaging method should be supplemented with a tail-capping mechanism. The current method can produce fatter tails than any individual forecaster intended, particularly when one forecaster has a much wider distribution than others.
- Consider adding a check that flags when the aggregated p10 or p90 falls significantly outside the range of individual forecaster p10/p90 values.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **o3 (F4 vs F5):** Same model, same data, but 2x difference in distribution width. F4's tails (5.35-5.95) are hard to justify given its own narrative about a 9bp σ environment. Consider whether the prompt could be more prescriptive about tail width relative to stated volatility.
- **Sonnet 4.5 (F1, F2):** Solid and consistent. Qualitative reasoning could be strengthened with more explicit quantitative calculations.
- **GPT-5.2 (F3):** Best source analysis but wider tails than warranted by the data. Good for diversity but may benefit from tighter calibration.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >20% of range (numeric) | No | Median spread 7bp; range is 2.73, so 7bp = 0.3% of range |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates directionally consistent with evidence |
| Factual errors present | No | Minor unverifiable statistics, no clear errors |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Yes | Influenced tail width; maintained diversity |
| Critical info missed in research | Partially | Treasury yields, MBS spreads, economic calendar not retrieved |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Partial | F4's tails are outliers relative to ensemble (p10: 5.35 vs mean 5.47; p90: 5.95 vs mean 5.83) |
