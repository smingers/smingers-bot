## yFinance Stock Return Distribution Tool Analysis

**This section directly addresses the user's primary question: Was the new yFinance tool used, was it successful, what did it produce, and how was it leveraged?**

### Was it used?

**Yes.** The `stock_return_enabled: true` config flag was active. The tool detected the question as a stock close price question via the `"close_price_rises"` JSON metadata in the question description, parsed the ticker (HAL), start date (2026-02-22), and end date (2026-02-28), and computed a 5-trading-day return distribution.

### Was it successfully completed?

**Yes, fully successful.** The `search_stock_return_distribution.json` artifact contains all fields with valid data. No errors occurred. The computation used 10 years of historical data (N=2,510 overlapping 5-day windows from 2010-2026).

### What information did it produce?

The tool produced a `StockReturnData` dataclass with:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Ticker | HAL |
| Window | 2026-02-22 to 2026-02-28 (5 trading days) |
| Current/reference price | $35.11 |
| Return so far | 0.0% (question just opened) |
| **P(positive 5-day return)** | **51.8%** |
| Sample size | 2,510 overlapping windows |
| Mean return | +0.29% |
| Median return | +0.23% |
| Std dev | 6.68% |
| 5th percentile | -9.06% |
| 25th percentile | -3.19% |
| 75th percentile | +3.74% |
| 95th percentile | +9.97% |
| 1-month trailing return | +5.25% |
| 3-month trailing return | +31.89% |
| 30-day realized volatility | 33.6% (annualized) |

### Where was the data sent and how was it leveraged?

The `format_stock_return_context()` function formats the data into a structured text block (`=== STOCK RETURN DISTRIBUTION ===`). Per `base_forecaster.py`, this context was injected into **three** places:

1. **Prepended to historical_context** (outside view prompt): All 5 forecasters received it as the first item in their outside view research context. Visible in `outside_view_prompt.md` — the stock return distribution block appears at the very top of the historical context.

2. **Prepended to current_context** (inside view prompt): All 5 forecasters received it again in their inside view context. Visible in `search_current.json` — the block appears at the start of the current context.

3. **Threaded into `question_details.stock_return_context`** for the agentic search agent: The agentic search agent had access to the programmatic base rate data, which it incorporated into its comprehensive synthesis report.

### How did the forecasters leverage the data?

**Every single forecaster explicitly anchored on the 51.8% base rate.** This is the most important finding:

| Forecaster | Model | Outside View | Inside View | How they used the base rate |
|------------|-------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| S1-1 / S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 50.1% | 50% | Started at 51.8%, adjusted -1.7pp for technical resistance, oil headwinds |
| S1-2 / S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 49.5% | 50% | Started at 51.8%, adjusted -2.3pp for 52-wk high, insider selling, Q1 weakness |
| S1-3 / S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 51.3% | 51% | Started at 51.8%, adjusted -0.5pp for regime variability; moved back up slightly in inside view |
| S1-4 / S2-4 | o3 | 50.8% | 53% | Started at 51.8%, adjusted -1pp (resistance) +1pp (sector support); **largest inside view shift** due to 52-wk high momentum |
| S1-5 / S2-5 | o3 | 48.8% | 49% | Started at 51.8%, adjusted -4pp for overbought + -1pp for oil, +1pp for momentum |

**Key observation:** The tool provided a **common quantitative anchor** that all forecasters used, preventing the common failure mode of stock questions where forecasters either (a) default to vague 50% without justification, or (b) overweight qualitative narratives. Instead, every forecaster explicitly cited the N=2,510 sample size and 51.8% base rate, then made reasoned adjustments in both directions.

### Comparison with the agentic search agent's usage

The agentic search agent (run as part of historical research) also consumed the stock return distribution data. Its step 1 executed:
- `"HAL"` via yFinance (additional real-time data pull)
- `"crude oil price WTI trend 2026"` via FRED

It produced a comprehensive 6-section report that incorporated the base rate, options data, fundamental context, and macro catalysts. The agent report concluded with its own probability assessment (48-52%), which aligns with the final ensemble output but represents a mild bleed of opinion into research context.

### Tool impact assessment

**The stock return distribution tool was a clear success for this question.** Specific wins:

1. **Prevented overconfidence**: Without the tool, forecasters often produce stock price predictions in the 55-65% range based on qualitative narratives. Here, the 51.8% anchor kept all predictions in the appropriately calibrated 49-53% range.

2. **Provided quantitative rigor**: The N=2,510 sample size, percentile distribution, and volatility data gave forecasters concrete numbers to work with rather than vague intuitions.

3. **Consistency across models**: The spread was only 4pp (49-53%), reflecting genuine agreement that this is approximately a coin flip — which is the correct answer for a 5-day stock direction question.

4. **Rich context**: The trailing returns (+5.25% 1-month, +31.89% 3-month) and volatility (33.6%) provided forecasters with additional context about the stock's current regime without requiring separate LLM queries.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Stock Return Distribution | Yes (programmatic) | Yes (prepended) | **Yes** |
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes |
| FRED | Yes (DCOILWTICO) | No | Yes |
| yFinance (via Agent) | Yes (via Agent step 1) | No | Yes |
| Google Trends | N/A | N/A | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes | No | Yes (1 URL) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent, FRED):
1. "HAL historical daily prices csv" (Google) — price history
2. "Halliburton outlook oil services 2026" (Google News) — sector context
3. "Retrieve HAL daily closes 2010-2026 and compute share of 4-day positive moves..." (Agent) — comprehensive synthesis
4. "DCOILWTICO" (FRED) — WTI crude oil prices

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "Halliburton outlook 2026 oil demand" (Google) — sector outlook
2. "Halliburton February 2026 analyst rating" (Google News) — recent analyst activity
3. "Summarize key news from 16-22 Feb 2026 on Halliburton..." (AskNews) — recent news

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Long-term base rates, historical patterns | Last 1-2 weeks |
| Content type | Price data, fundamentals, oil macro | Analyst actions, recent news flow |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent, FRED | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Base rate, oil price trend, sector context | Analyst target raises, recent sentiment |

**Analysis:**
- Queries are well-differentiated between historical (base rate establishment) and current (recent catalyst surfacing).
- The Agent query was particularly effective, synthesizing multiple sub-queries (yFinance for HAL price data, FRED for crude oil, Google/Google News for analyst context) into a comprehensive report.
- FRED's DCOILWTICO series provided high-quality macro context for oil price trends.
- The stock return distribution tool effectively replaced what would have been a manual/LLM-guided yFinance lookup, providing more rigorous and deterministic output.
- Critical gap: No options chain data was directly computed (the agent report mentions it but from secondary sources).

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

**Yes — the Agent report crosses the line.** The agentic search agent's report concludes with a "Probability Assessment for Resolution" section that estimates "48-52%" — this is a forecast embedded in research output. While the analysis is well-reasoned, it introduces the agent's opinion into what should be factual context for the forecasters.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** HAL-specific 5-day base rate (51.8%), current price ($35.11), 52-week high proximity, Q4 earnings beat, Q1 weakness guidance, analyst target raises ($38-40), insider selling, WTI oil price levels, ex-dividend date
- **Critical information missed:** Nothing significant. For a 5-day stock question, the coverage was thorough.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Stock Return Distribution: **Excellent** — deterministic, large-N, directly relevant
  - Google/Google News: **Good** — surfaced relevant Zacks, Morningstar, and sector articles
  - Agent report: **Very good** — comprehensive synthesis with real-time yFinance and FRED data; mild issue with embedded probability assessment
  - AskNews articles: **Mixed** — significant ticker collision noise (HAL.NS, HAL.AX, HALB) diluted the signal, but did surface relevant Halliburton-specific articles (price target raises, dividend announcement)
  - FRED data: **Excellent** — authoritative WTI crude oil prices with trend data
  - Question URL scraping: **Good** — Yahoo Finance page provided useful price and analyst data; 2/5 scraped URLs (Nasdaq, Barchart) returned no useful content

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough 8-source analysis with clear quality ratings. Correctly identifies programmatic data as highest quality, distinguishes fact vs. opinion for each source. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 candidate classes (generic stock, HAL-specific, energy near highs, OFS in bearish oil). Correctly selects HAL-specific 5-day return as best fit. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 5 trading days, notes random walk dominance and high std dev. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear itemized adjustments from 51.8%: -1% (52-wk high), -0.5% (Q1 guidance), -1% (oil macro), +0.5% (options), +0.3% (analyst targets) = -1.7pp to 50.1%. Well-justified. 4/4

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Also thorough, covers 8 sources. Correctly flags StockInvest.us as factual, Zacks as credible expert opinion. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same 4 candidates as S1-1. Correctly selects HAL-specific as most suitable. 3/4 (slightly less developed justification than S1-1)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 5 trading days, notes random walk, mentions high vol. Slightly less quantitative than S1-1. 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Adjustments from 51.8%: -1% (52-wk high), -0.5% (Q1 guidance), -1% (oil macro), +0.5% (analyst targets), +0.5% (sector/oil support), +0.3% (options) = -1.2pp, resulting in ~49.5%. Clearly itemized. 4/4

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Detailed, careful separation of fact vs. opinion. Correctly notes that options data from Agent report is "suggestive, not anchor-grade." 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidates considered; correctly selects HAL-specific 5-day windows as best. Justification is concise and sound. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 5 trading days. Notes high upset rate (~48.2% are down). Good application of calibration reasoning. 3/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Anchors at 51.8%, makes only a small adjustment toward 50% for regime variability, resulting in 51.3%. Appropriately conservative — notes estimation noise and stays within the base rate's 95% CI. 4/4

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Clear, concise categorization of all sources by reliability. Good factual/opinion distinction. 4/4
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same three candidates; correctly selects HAL 5-day windows. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly notes 4-5 trading days (Feb 22 to Feb 28 = Saturday, so effectively Friday close). Computes 1-sigma band from implied vol. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Start at 51.8%, -2pp (52-wk high/mean reversion), +1pp (sector/oil support) = 50.8%. Clean, well-justified. Notes result is within the 95% CI of the base rate estimate — excellent calibration awareness. 4/4

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but covers key sources. Correctly rates programmatic data as highest quality. 3/4 (less depth than peers)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidates; selects HAL-specific. Cites idiosyncratic beta argument for preferring narrow class. 4/4
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 4-5 actual trading days. Computes daily sigma (~2.1%) and 5-day band. Notes even routine noise can cross threshold. 4/4
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Start at 51.8%, -4pp (overbought/weak guidance), +1pp (momentum/positioning) = 48.8%. The -4pp is the largest negative adjustment among all forecasters and is arguably slightly aggressive given the noise in 5-day returns. However, the reasoning (top-decile starting position historically yields 46% positive) is well-supported if the cited statistic is accurate. 3/4

- **Score:** 14/16

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Prediction |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self-model, 50.1%) | 50.1% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3, 50.8%) | 50.8% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6, 49.5%) | 49.5% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2, 51.3%) | 51.3% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model, 48.8%) | 48.8% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1 (50.1%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied well. Correctly identifies base rate (51.8%) and 52-wk high as strong evidence; analyst targets, Q1 guidance, and insider selling as moderate. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 50.1% -> Output: 50%, Delta = -0.1pp). Minimal shift from outside view. Well-justified — no new strong evidence to move further. 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses halved (2-3 days: ~50%) and doubled (10 days: 48-49% toward bearish fundamentals). 4/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 6 elements completed meaningfully. Paraphrase correct, base rate stated, consistency check ("50 out of 100 times"), top evidence listed, blind spot (oil price catalyst), status quo (no change = No). 4/4

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4 (50.8%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good framework application. Notes base rate and 52-wk high resistance as strong; analyst targets, Q1 guidance, insider selling as moderate; Zacks "fully priced" and Morningstar FV as weak. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 50.8% -> Output: 50%, Delta = -0.8pp). Moves from o3's 50.8% toward 50% by incorporating insider selling and "fully priced" narrative from current context. Reasonable shift. 3/4 (mentions the outside view gives "50.8%" but refers to it as "49.5%" at one point — minor inconsistency in the checklist where it says "Outside view base rate previously established: 49.5%")
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addresses halved/doubled timeframes. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed, including blind spot (macro shock). 3/4

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2 (49.5%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Systematic Strong/Moderate/Weak classification. Notes that the "near-high / fully priced" arguments are stale and digested — good critical assessment. Highlights clustered analyst target raises as mildly positive incremental newsflow. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 49.5% -> Output: 51%, Delta = +1.5pp). Moves *upward* from the Sonnet 4.6 outside view — justified by noting bearish points are stale/known while target raises are fresh. This is the only forecaster to explicitly argue for moving back toward (and slightly above) the base rate. 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halved (closer to 50/50), doubled (momentum plays out more). 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Well-completed. Key evidence enumerated concisely. Blind spot: sharp oil-price drawdown or macro risk-off. 4/4

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 (51.3%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Identifies strong (base rate, volatility band), moderate (52-wk high mean-reversion, momentum, analyst upgrades), and weak (soft guidance, WTI dip) evidence. 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 51.3% -> Output: 53%, Delta = +1.7pp). This is the **largest upward shift** in the ensemble. Justified by: +1.5pp for 52-wk high momentum (cites academic studies showing 55-57% follow-through after new highs), +1.0pp for clustered analyst upgrades, -1.0pp for insider selling/narrative. Net +1.5pp. 3/4 (the 55-57% follow-through claim is plausible but unverifiable)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed — halved (closer to 50%), doubled (momentum matters more). 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot: >3% crude jump on supply scare. 4/4

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5 (48.8%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Identifies strong (base rate, volatility band), moderate (52-wk high, momentum, analyst upgrades, option skew), weak (guidance, WTI softness). 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 48.8% -> Output: 49%, Delta = +0.2pp). Minimal shift. Maintains bearish tilt from outside view. Start at 51.8%, -3pp (mean-reversion), +1pp (momentum), -1pp (oil softness), +1pp (option tilt) = 49%. Well-articulated. 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Addressed. 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completed. Blind spot: sudden >3% jump in crude. 4/4

- **Score:** 15/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 50.1% | 50% | -0.1pp | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 50.8% | 50% | -0.8pp | 13/16 | Partial (minor inconsistency in stated outside view) |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 49.5% | 51% | +1.5pp | 15/16 | Yes (argues bearish points are stale, fresh upgrades positive) |
| S2-4 | o3 | 51.3% | 53% | +1.7pp | 14/16 | Partial (momentum claim plausible but unverified) |
| S2-5 | o3 | 48.8% | 49% | +0.2pp | 15/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Did cross-model instances engage meaningfully?** Yes, but the effect is muted by the nature of this question. All outside views were so close to each other (48.8-51.3%) that cross-pollination had minimal material to work with. The cross-model pairs (S2-2 Sonnet receiving o3's 50.8%, S2-3 GPT receiving Sonnet's 49.5%, S2-4 o3 receiving GPT's 51.3%) all produced inside views within 2pp of their received outside view.

- **Over/under-weighting of cross-pollinated input?** S2-2 (Sonnet 4.6 receiving o3's 50.8%) moved *away* from the received input toward 50%, suggesting mild disagreement with o3's slightly bullish positioning. S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT's 51.3%) moved *further bullish* to 53%, adding its own momentum analysis on top. Both are reasonable.

- **Same-model vs cross-model?** S2-1 (self-Sonnet) barely moved (-0.1pp). S2-5 (self-o3) also barely moved (+0.2pp). The cross-model pairs showed slightly larger shifts but still within 2pp. No meaningful diversity difference.

- **Net effect on diversity:** Cross-pollination slightly *increased* diversity — the final range (49-53%) is wider than the outside view range (48.8-51.3%), driven primarily by S2-4's momentum argument pushing to 53%.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: HAL close on Feb 28 > close on Feb 22.
- S1-3 (GPT-5.2) and S1-5 (o3) both noted that Feb 28 is a Saturday, so the effective resolution date is Friday Feb 27 — a nuance other forecasters missed. This doesn't affect the outcome (Yahoo Finance will pull the correct last trading day close) but shows superior attention to detail.
- All correctly identified the reference close price as $35.11.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. HAL-specific 5-day positive return base rate: 51.8% (N=2,510) — cited by all 10 outputs
2. Stock near 52-week high ($35.11 vs. $35.85) — cited by all outputs
3. Q1 2026 guidance for sequential revenue/margin declines — cited by all outputs
4. Ex-dividend date March 4 (after resolution window) — cited by most outputs
5. WTI crude ~$62.53, down 12% YoY — cited by all outputs

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-4 | Unverifiable claim | Claims "52-wk high stocks show 55-57% 5-day follow-through per academic papers" — no specific citation | Low (directional claim is plausible but unverifiable) |
| S1-5 / S2-5 | Unverifiable claim | Claims "HAL posts positive return in only 46% of 5-day windows starting in top decile" — not from provided data | Medium (if incorrect, the -3pp adjustment is too aggressive) |
| S2-2 | Inconsistency | States "Outside view base rate previously established: 49.5%" in checklist, but received S1-4's 50.8% | Low (final prediction unaffected) |

### Hallucinations

The o3 forecasters (S1-4, S1-5, S2-4, S2-5) introduce specific statistical claims about 52-week high follow-through rates that are not present in the provided research context. These aren't clearly hallucinations (they could be from model training data), but they aren't verifiable from the artifacts and represent a risk.

---

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review

### Divergence & Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Divergence metric | std_dev |
| Divergence value | ~1.6pp (std dev of [50, 50, 51, 53, 49]) |
| Trigger threshold | 15.0pp |
| Supervisor triggered? | No |
| Margin below threshold | ~13.4pp |

Supervisor was not triggered. The ensemble achieved strong consensus near 50%, well below the 15pp divergence threshold.

---

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent use of programmatic stock return distribution tool**: The new yFinance-based tool provided a rigorous, deterministic base rate (51.8%) that all 5 forecasters explicitly anchored on. This is exactly the kind of anchoring that prevents both overconfidence and aimless 50% defaults.
2. **Appropriate calibration for question type**: A 5-day stock direction question is fundamentally near-50/50, and the ensemble correctly recognized this. The 4pp spread (49-53%) reflects genuine consensus rather than forced agreement.
3. **Multi-tool research depth**: The pipeline used Stock Return Distribution + Google + Google News + Agent + FRED + AskNews + URL scraping, providing comprehensive coverage from deterministic computation, web search, news aggregation, and government data.
4. **Clear reasoning chains**: Every forecaster articulated specific adjustments from the base rate with directional justification and approximate magnitudes.

### Weaknesses
1. **Agent report includes probability assessment**: The agentic search report concludes with "48-52%" — injecting the agent's opinion into research context that should remain factual.
2. **AskNews ticker collision**: The "HAL" ticker query returned many irrelevant results (Hindustan Aeronautics, Halo Technologies, Halberd Corp), wasting context window space.
3. **Unverifiable statistical claims**: Two o3 forecasters cite specific statistics about 52-week high follow-through rates that aren't from the provided data.
4. **Some scraped URLs returned no data**: 2/5 question URL scrapes (Nasdaq, Barchart) returned empty or generic content.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| **B+** | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

The forecast is well-calibrated and demonstrates excellent use of the new stock return distribution tool. The B+ (rather than A) is due to the agent report's embedded probability assessment, the AskNews noise, and the unverifiable statistical claims from o3. The core forecast quality is high — the 50.6% final prediction is a sensible output for this inherently unpredictable question.

---

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- **Filter AskNews by ticker context**: For stock questions, consider adding company name filtering (e.g., "Halliburton" rather than just "HAL") to avoid ticker collision with HAL.NS, HAL.AX, etc.
- **Prevent agent report probability estimates**: Add a system instruction to the agentic search agent prohibiting probability forecasts in its output — it should provide facts and context only.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **Consider conditional options data**: The stock return distribution tool could optionally include options-implied probabilities if options data is available, reducing reliance on secondary sources for this information.

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **o3**: Tends to introduce unverifiable statistical claims from training data (52-week high follow-through rates). Should be prompted to only cite statistics from provided sources.
- **GPT-5.2**: Showed the most calibration humility in outside view (51.3%), staying closest to the base rate. Its inside view reasoning was also the most analytically distinctive — arguing that bearish points were "stale" while upgrades were "fresh."
- **Sonnet 4.6**: Produced the most systematic and thorough source analyses, but inside view outputs were nearly identical to each other despite receiving different cross-pollinated inputs.

## 9. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp (binary) | No | 4pp spread (49-53%) |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates are directionally consistent with stated evidence |
| Factual errors present | Partial | Minor: unverifiable claims from o3, checklist inconsistency in S2-2 |
| Hallucinations detected | No | No invented facts; unverifiable claims are from model training data |
| Cross-pollination effective | Partial | Limited effect due to narrow outside view range |
| Critical info missed in research | No | Comprehensive coverage for a stock question |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All correctly cite 51.8% from programmatic tool |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | No | S2-4 at 53% is the highest but within ~1 SD |
| Supervisor triggered | No | Divergence well below threshold (1.6pp vs 15pp threshold) |
