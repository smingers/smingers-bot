# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Forecaster 4 EUSS interpretation crashes probability to 12% | Critical | S2-4 (o3) | Forecaster 4 interpreted the "majority of grants" fine-print clause as requiring the 10-year baseline to cover EUSS grants (67% of all ILR grants). Since EUSS is protected by the Withdrawal Agreement and explicitly out of scope, F4 concluded the question resolves No regardless of policy implementation, driving its probability to 12%. This is likely an overread of the fine print, but creates a 60 pp outlier that pulls the weighted average down by ~12 pp. |
| Ensemble divergence (std_dev 25.95 pp) triggered supervisor | High | Aggregation | The 12%-72% range across forecasters produces std_dev of 25.95 pp (threshold: 15 pp), driven almost entirely by Forecaster 4's EUSS interpretation. The supervisor correctly identified and partially resolved this disagreement. |
| Tight resolution window creates binary fragility | Medium | All forecasters | The question resolves on "before May 1, 2026" and the target implementation date is April 2026. Even a small scheduling slip (Easter recess, processing 130k consultation responses) flips the outcome. |
| Employment Law Worldview "Summer 2026" dissent underweighted | Low | S2-1, S2-2, S2-5 | One immigration law analysis (Dec 8, 2025) projected implementation in "Summer 2026 onwards," which would resolve No. Only Forecasters 1 and 3 meaningfully engaged with this signal. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact
- **Low**: Minor issue

## Summary

- **Question ID:** 42230
- **Question Title:** Will the UK increase the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years before May 2026?
- **Question Type:** binary
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-02-20
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Forecast Window:** 70 days
- **Ensemble Prediction:** 57.8%
- **Supervisor Override:** 65% (confidence: MEDIUM)
- **Final Submitted Prediction:** 65%
- **Step 2 Predictions:** S2-1: 72%, S2-2: 72%, S2-3: 62%, S2-4: 12%, S2-5: 71%
- **Spread:** 60 pp (12%-72%)
- **Total Cost:** $1.58
- **Duration:** 353 seconds
- **Community Prediction:** Not available (97 forecasters)
- **One-sentence quality assessment:** The ensemble produced thoughtful analysis of a genuinely uncertain policy-implementation question, but Forecaster 4's creative but likely incorrect EUSS fine-print interpretation created extreme divergence that the supervisor partially but not fully corrected -- the final 65% is reasonable for the core timing question but the EUSS interpretation deserved more decisive resolution.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (16 results) |
| FRED | No | No | No |
| yFinance | No | No | No |
| Google Trends | No | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (4 URLs scraped) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "earned settlement consultation 10 year ILR" (Google) -- targeted the consultation document
2. "indefinite leave 10-year baseline April 2026" (Google News) -- focused on implementation timeline
3. Agent query tracing legislative progress, draft Immigration Rules, statutory instruments, and Hansard records -- comprehensive

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "settlement qualifying period 10 years UK" (Google) -- general current status
2. "Home Office earned settlement 10 years" (Google News) -- latest developments
3. AskNews query on latest developments, legislative progress, and commencement dates -- well-targeted

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Nov 2025 consultation launch through Feb 2026 | Latest Feb 2026 developments, consultation closure |
| Content type | Government consultation document, legal analysis, immigration statistics | News coverage, stakeholder reactions, implementation signals |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Full consultation text, ILR grant statistics, legal framework | Consultation closure, 130k responses, law firm implementation projections |

**Analysis:**
- Query discreteness is good. Historical queries targeted the legislative/regulatory framework; current queries focused on implementation signals and stakeholder reactions.
- The Agent report was well-targeted but could not locate the exact Sett_02 table for YE Sep 2025, leaving the EUSS/non-EUSS breakdown partially unverified. However, the question URL scraping of the GOV.UK statistics page did provide the key figure: 67% EUSS, 32% non-EUSS settlement.
- Question URL scraping was highly productive -- 4 of the 5 URLs in the question text were scraped, yielding the official consultation document, ILR statistics, and the Gallup immigration poll.
- AskNews returned 16 results, though several were irrelevant (Italian tax settlements, Indian medical claims). The relevant UK articles from The Tablet, Birmingham Mail, The Sun, and several Indian outlets provided useful stakeholder perspectives.
- **Gap:** No query targeted UK parliamentary recess dates or the specific 21-day laying period mechanics for Statements of Changes. This would have sharpened the timing analysis.
- **Gap:** No query specifically asked about the EUSS/non-EUSS distinction in the fine-print context, which became the most consequential analytical question.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The research outputs remained appropriately factual. Article summaries reported stakeholder positions and timelines without offering probability estimates. The Agent report compiled legislative history without forecasting. Clean separation maintained.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Home Secretary's explicit April 2026 implementation commitment (Hansard, Nov 2025)
  - Consultation closed Feb 12, 2026 with ~130,000 responses
  - Minister Mike Tapp confirmed intent to proceed (Feb 2, 2026 Westminster Hall debate)
  - Statement of Changes expected March 2026 (Newland Chase)
  - "Staggered starting April 2026" implementation language
  - ILR grant breakdown: 67% EUSS, 32% non-EUSS (YE Sep 2025)
  - Employment Law Worldview "Summer 2026" dissent (Dec 2025)
  - Multiple law firms advising clients to rush existing ILR applications
  - Negative procedure mechanism (no primary legislation required)

- **Critical information partially addressed:**
  - Whether the "majority of grants" fine-print clause would include EUSS
  - Parliamentary sitting dates and Easter recess timing

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News: Good -- surfaced Newland Chase, Mishcon de Reya, Employment Law Worldview, and BBC coverage
  - Agent report: Adequate -- found legislative history but couldn't access the Sett_02 Excel table
  - AskNews: Mixed -- 16 results, ~8 directly relevant, rest irrelevant
  - Question URL scraping: Excellent -- the GOV.UK consultation document, statistics page, and Gallup poll were the most valuable single sources

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self, Sonnet 4.6) | 70% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 68% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | 68% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 66.7% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self, o3) | 68% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Correctly identified Home Secretary's parliamentary commitment and consultation closure as strong evidence. Employment Law Worldview "Summer 2026" dissent identified as moderate counter-evidence. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 70% -> Output 72%, delta = +2 pp. Justified by net adjustments: +3% (pre-drafting), +2% (low resolution bar), +2% (Hansard commitment), -3% (Summer 2026 dissent), -2% (no draft rules). Well-structured. Score: 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good analysis of Easter recess and 21-day laying period. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Good blind-spot: Home Office announces rules in late March but Easter recess prevents 21-day period from completing before May 1. Score: 3/4

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Thorough analysis of 12+ sources. Good use of AskNews articles. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 68% -> Output 72%, delta = +4 pp. Upward: +5 (parliamentary commitment), +3 (consultation closed), +3 (negative procedure), +2 (political incentive). Downward: -4 (70-day brittleness), -3 (Summer 2026 dissent), -2 (resolution requires effect on applicants), -1 (legal challenge). Net +3 pp. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Correct identification that small delays have outsized impact given tight deadline. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Blind-spot: rules announced in April but commencement date of May 1 or later. Score: 3/4

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Best-structured of the ensemble. Correctly identified that the status quo ("if nothing changes") resolves No, creating a meaningful action requirement. Score: 4/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 68% -> Output 62%, delta = -6 pp. The only forecaster to adjust *downward*. Justified by: +3 to +6 (consultation closed, primary signals), -6 to -10 (brittle threshold, fine-print ambiguity). Most careful engagement with EUSS ambiguity without going to Forecaster 4's extreme. Score: 4/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good observation that timing slippage risk is "unusually consequential." Score: 4/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Excellent blind-spot: government lays/commences rules in April but designs transition so no "applicants" are affected pre-May. Subtlest failure mode identified by any forecaster. Score: 4/4

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Focused heavily on the "majority of grants" fine-print clause. Correctly identified the 67% EUSS share. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 66.7% -> Output 12%, delta = -54.7 pp. The dramatic outlier. Reasoning: EUSS grants (67%) are exempt from the 10-year rule, so it wouldn't apply to the "majority of grants," resolving No. Assigned 80% weight to literal reading, 20% to looser reading, yielding 0.8 x 7% + 0.2 x 42% = ~12%. Score: 1/4 -- The interpretation is creative but over-applies a clause designed for a different scenario. The fine print says "If the baseline requirement is increased for *some visa categories but not others*" -- EUSS is not a "visa category" in the standard settlement sense; it's a separate legal framework under the Withdrawal Agreement. The question is clearly about the earned settlement proposal, which doesn't interact with EUSS.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Not meaningfully analyzed -- the EUSS interpretation dominated. Score: 1/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Blind-spot: "Ministers unexpectedly extend the 10-year rule to EUSS via emergency legislation." Reveals the depth of the interpretive commitment. Score: 2/4

- **Score:** 7/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Good source analysis. Correct prioritization. Score: 3/4
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 68% -> Output 71%, delta = +3 pp. Upward: +5 (ministerial commitment), +3 (negative procedure). Downward: -3 (compressed drafting calendar), -2 (phased commencement risk). Clean and well-structured. Score: 3/4
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good YES/NO path analysis. YES: consultation digested -> Statement of Changes late March -> commence 22 April. NO: phased start June 2026 or later. Score: 3/4
- **Calibration Checklist:** Good blind-spot: phased commencement starting June 2026. Score: 3/4

- **Score:** 12/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 70% (S1-1) | 72% | +2 pp | 13/16 | Yes -- modest, well-structured |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 68% (S1-4) | 72% | +4 pp | 12/16 | Yes -- good cross-pollination |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 68% (S1-2) | 62% | -6 pp | 16/16 | Yes -- most nuanced treatment |
| S2-4 | o3 | 66.7% (S1-3) | 12% | -54.7 pp | 7/16 | No -- likely incorrect EUSS interpretation |
| S2-5 | o3 | 68% (S1-5) | 71% | +3 pp | 12/16 | Yes -- clean and proportionate |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.6 <- o3 S1-4):** Good engagement. Received 68% from o3 and moved to 72%, citing ministerial commitment and consultation closure. Genuine integration.

- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2 <- Sonnet 4.6 S1-2):** Excellent engagement. Received 68% and moved to 62%, the only downward adjustment. Demonstrated the value of cross-model perspective -- engaged deeply with timing fragility and fine-print ambiguity.

- **S2-4 (o3 <- GPT-5.2 S1-3):** Problematic. Received 66.7% from GPT-5.2 (which had flagged the EUSS ambiguity as a concern but not dominating) and crashed to 12%. The cross-pollinated input was essentially ignored in favor of a novel interpretive theory. Cross-pollination had negative value here.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** Both made proportionate updates. S2-1 went 70% -> 72%; S2-5 went 68% -> 71%. Consistent and reasonable.

- **Net effect on diversity:** Cross-pollination dramatically *increased* diversity in an unhelpful way. Outside views clustered at 66.7-70% (3.3 pp spread), but inside views ranged 12-72% (60 pp spread), driven entirely by S2-4. Excluding S2-4, the range would be 62-72% (10 pp), a modest and appropriate widening.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: baseline qualifying period must be 10+ years before May 1, 2026.
- All correctly identified the key mechanism: Statement of Changes to Immigration Rules, not primary legislation.
- All correctly identified the April 2026 target date from Hansard.
- All correctly identified the consultation closing date of February 12, 2026.
- **Divergence point:** Interpretation of the "majority of grants" fine-print clause. Four forecasters read this as a tiebreaker for partial-category scenarios -- correctly, in my assessment. Forecaster 4 read it as a structural barrier due to EUSS.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Home Secretary committed to April 2026 implementation (Hansard, Nov 2025) -- universal
2. Consultation closed February 12, 2026 -- universal
3. Negative procedure mechanism (no primary legislation required) -- 4/5
4. 67% EUSS vs. 32% non-EUSS ILR grants in YE Sep 2025 -- 3/5
5. ~130,000 consultation responses received -- via supervisor research
6. Statement of Changes expected March 2026 -- via supervisor research (Newland Chase)

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-4 | Interpretive error | Treated EUSS as a "visa category" subject to the "majority of grants" clause. EUSS is a separate legal framework under the Withdrawal Agreement. The fine print addresses "if the baseline requirement is increased for some visa categories but not others" -- about selective implementation within the earned settlement framework, not about separate treaty-based schemes. | Critical -- drives the 12% outlier |
| S2-1 | Minor ambiguity | Cited "pre-drafting of core rules" as +3% but no evidence of pre-drafting was surfaced | Low |

### Hallucinations

No hallucinated facts, dates, events, or sources detected.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Exceptional outside view consensus:** All five forecasters converged on 66.7-70% using different reference class approaches. This 3.3 pp spread on a genuinely uncertain question demonstrates robust shared analysis.
2. **GPT-5.2's inside view (S2-3) was the strongest individual output:** The only forecaster to adjust downward, with the most nuanced treatment of timing fragility, the subtlest blind-spot scenario, and honest engagement with fine-print ambiguity without going to the EUSS extreme.
3. **Research was highly productive:** Question URL scraping of GOV.UK pages provided the most critical evidence. The supervisor research added the Newland Chase finding ("Statement of Changes expected March 2026, staggered starting April 2026").
4. **Supervisor correctly identified the key disagreement** and resolved it in a well-reasoned direction.

### Weaknesses
1. **Forecaster 4's EUSS interpretation:** The 12% is almost certainly wrong. The "majority of grants" clause is designed for scenarios where the government raises the baseline for some non-EUSS categories but not others. EUSS has no "baseline qualifying period" in the earned-settlement sense.
2. **No forecaster researched parliamentary procedure specifics:** The 21-day laying convention was mentioned but never verified. Easter recess dates and their interaction with the laying period were mentioned only in passing.
3. **130,000 consultation responses underweighted:** Newland Chase noted ~6 weeks for analysis, meaning analysis could extend to late March, compressing the window further.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

The ensemble demonstrated strong analytical capability on a genuinely difficult question. The outside view consensus (66.7-70%) was well-grounded. Four of five inside views produced thoughtful, well-justified updates. GPT-5.2's S2-3 was exemplary. The critical weakness -- Forecaster 4's EUSS interpretation -- was an isolated analytical error that the supervisor partially corrected. The final 65% is reasonable: it reflects the core timing uncertainty (~70% for on-schedule implementation) discounted modestly for fine-print ambiguity and implementation fragility. The grade is held back from B+ by the severity of the Forecaster 4 outlier and the collective failure to investigate parliamentary procedure and recess timing more thoroughly.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- For questions involving UK Immigration Rules changes, the Agent should be explicitly prompted to research parliamentary procedure for Statements of Changes (21-day convention, negative resolution procedure, sitting-day calculations around recess periods).
- When a question's fine print references specific statistics pages, consider having the Agent directly compute the relevant breakdown and flag interpretive implications.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- When ensemble divergence is driven by an interpretive disagreement about resolution criteria (rather than factual or judgment disagreements), the supervisor should weigh this more heavily and consider the question author's likely intent.
- Consider a "fine-print stress test" where forecasters are explicitly asked: "What interpretation of the fine print would produce the opposite resolution? How likely is that interpretation?"

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.6:** Consistent, solid performance. Both instances converged to 72% despite different cross-pollinated inputs, suggesting genuine convergence.
- **GPT-5.2:** Best individual output (S2-3, 16/16). Excels at nuanced uncertainty quantification. The downward adjustment from 68% to 62% was the most analytically honest in the ensemble.
- **o3:** Split performance. S2-5 was solid (71%). S2-4 produced the critical outlier (12%) by fixating on a creative but contextually implausible interpretation. Both o3 instances received similar outside view inputs (~66.7% and 68%) but diverged to 12% and 71%, indicating model-level risk when encountering ambiguous fine print.

## 9. Supervisor Performance Assessment

### Context

The supervisor was triggered automatically due to ensemble divergence of 25.95 pp (threshold: 15.0 pp). Executed using Claude Opus 4.6 at a cost of $0.40.

### Supervisor Input

| Forecaster | Model | Inside View |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 72% |
| 2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 72% |
| 3 | GPT-5.2 | 62% |
| 4 | o3 | 12% |
| 5 | o3 | 71% |

Weighted average: 57.8%

### Disagreement Analysis Quality

The supervisor identified three clear disagreements, ranked by impact:

1. **EUSS and the "majority of grants" clause (MASSIVE impact):** Correctly identified as the dominant source of divergence (~45-60 pp). Root cause correctly identified as part factual, part interpretive.

2. **Timing risk (moderate impact):** Correctly noted the 62-72% range among non-EUSS-focused forecasters. Root cause: different weighting of the same evidence.

3. **"Affecting applicants" before May 1 (minor impact):** Correctly identified as raised primarily by Forecaster 3.

**Assessment:** Excellent disagreement identification. Three-tier ranking is correct, root cause analysis is precise, and the distinction between factual vs. interpretive disagreements is well-drawn.

### Research Quality

The supervisor generated four search queries:
1. `UK ILR grants EUSS proportion 2025 statistics` (Google) -- targeting Disagreement 1
2. `UK settlement qualifying period 10 years statement of changes 2026` (Google News) -- targeting Disagreement 2
3. Agent query on EUSS/non-EUSS grant breakdown -- deepening Disagreement 1
4. `UK earned settlement immigration rules April 2026 implementation timeline` (Google News) -- targeting Disagreement 2

**Key findings:**
- **Newland Chase (Feb 2026):** Statement of Changes expected March 2026; "staggered starting April 2026." Most resolution-relevant new evidence.
- **Agent report:** Confirmed EUSS historically 88-93% of all ILR grants (YE June 2022-2023) but couldn't get exact YE Sep 2025 figures.
- **Mishcon de Reya (Dec 2025):** Cautious -- "Changes *may* be introduced from April 2026."
- **Employment Law Worldview (Dec 2025):** Reiterated "Summer 2026" implementation.

**Assessment:** Research was well-targeted. The Newland Chase finding was the most valuable single addition.

### Updated Forecast Quality

**Supervisor's prediction: 65% (confidence: MEDIUM)**

**Key reasoning:**

1. **EUSS interpretation likely incorrect:** Assigned ~15-20% probability that it would cause No resolution. Well-calibrated -- acknowledges ambiguity without accepting the extreme interpretation.

2. **Timing probability 65-72%:** Based on Newland Chase "March Statement of Changes, staggered April" signal, discounted for "Summer 2026" dissent and 130k consultation responses.

3. **Combined:** ~70% timing x ~88% EUSS doesn't block = ~62%, adjusted to 65%.

**Assessment:** The 65% represents a meaningful improvement over the weighted average of 57.8%. The 7.2 pp upward shift partially corrects for Forecaster 4's outlier while preserving a modest EUSS discount. If the EUSS concern is truly negligible (~5-10%), the "correct" probability would be closer to 67-70%, suggesting the supervisor was slightly conservative but within reasonable range.

|-----------|--------|-------|
| Disagreement identification | Excellent | All three disagreements correctly identified with proper attribution and impact ranking |
| Research targeting | Strong | Queries directly addressed disagreements; Newland Chase finding was high-value |
| Evidence integration | Good | Correctly assessed EUSS interpretation as "likely incorrect" with appropriate uncertainty discount |
| Forecast adjustment | Good | 57.8% -> 65% directionally correct; possibly slightly conservative |
| Confidence calibration | Good | MEDIUM appropriate given unresolved EUSS ambiguity |
| Cost efficiency | Good | $0.40 for resolution of a 60 pp divergence |

**Overall Supervisor Grade: B+**

The supervisor correctly identified that the massive divergence was driven by a likely-incorrect interpretive reading, conducted targeted research, and produced a well-reasoned adjusted forecast. The main limitation is that it could have been more decisive in discounting the EUSS interpretation.
