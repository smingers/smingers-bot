# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Massive downward updates from S1→S2 across all forecasters | High | S2-all | Every forecaster shifted dramatically downward (8-60pp), with S2-5 dropping from 78%→18%. The inside view evidence may not warrant such extreme revisions from well-reasoned base rates. |
| S2-5 outlier at 18% drags final aggregate down | High | S2-5 / Aggregation | S2-5's 18% is 17pp below the next-lowest (S2-2 at 30%) and 29pp below S2-1. This single extreme output pulls the equal-weighted average from ~39.5% to 35.2%. |
| Agent report contains forecasting opinion | Med | Research | The agent report concludes with an explicit probability assessment ("better than 50% probability") rather than sticking to factual synthesis. This may anchor downstream forecasters. |
| Inconsistent weighting of polling credibility | Med | S2-2, S2-5 | S2-2 and S2-5 weight independent polls at 75% probability of being accurate vs government polls at 25%, despite the documented 2022 polling miss where independent polls were far less accurate. |
| No seat-projection model scrutiny | Med | S2-all | All forecasters cite the Polit Pro seat projection (Fidesz 89, Tisza 99) as strong evidence without questioning its methodology, which is based on independent poll averages that may systematically undercount Fidesz. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (hit rate limit on deep research) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No (not relevant) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not relevant) |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No (not MC) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (1 URL scraped) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "2022 Hungarian election seat share" (Google)
2. "2026 Hungarian election polls February 2026" (Google News)
3. "Provide historical seat counts for Fidesz-KDNP in 2014, 2018, 2022 Hungarian elections and latest national polls Feb 2026 including party vote shares and seat projection estimates; assess likelihood of any coalition reaching 133 seats" (Agent)

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "2026 Hungarian election polls seats" (Google)
2. "Fidesz KDNP supermajority 2026 election" (Google News)
3. "What do February 2026 opinion polls suggest about seat projections and the chance of any party winning a two-thirds majority in the upcoming Hungarian parliamentary election?" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Past elections (2014-2022) + current polls | Latest February 2026 polls & campaign news |
| Content type | Electoral system mechanics, seat counts, structural analysis | Polling data, campaign developments, prediction markets |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Base rate establishment, system mechanics, expert thresholds | Campaign dynamics, latest polls, Polymarket data |

**Analysis:**
- The historical and current query sets are moderately discrete. Historical queries correctly target base rate establishment and electoral system mechanics. Current queries surface the February 2026 polling landscape.
- The Agent query was excellent — comprehensive and directly relevant, asking for both historical seats and current projections. It returned a thorough report with specific polling numbers from multiple institutes.
- A notable overlap: query #2 in historical ("2026 Hungarian election polls February 2026") overlaps significantly with current queries. This is a minor inefficiency.
- **Key gap**: No query specifically targeted seat-projection models or electoral simulations. The Polit Pro seat projection was found incidentally but no dedicated search sought out multiple seat models.
- AskNews hit its rate limit on deep research, limiting the depth of current news analysis.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report explicitly offers probability assessments: "the modal forecast is that Fidesz-KDNP remains the most likely (better than 50% probability) to retain two-thirds." This crosses the line from factual synthesis into forecasting. While the analysis is thoughtful, embedding a probability estimate in research may anchor downstream forecasters. Several forecasters did reference the agent's assessment of likelihood, potentially reducing independence.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:**
  - Complete historical seat counts for 2014/2018/2022 under the current system (133, 134, 135)
  - Detailed explanation of the winner-compensation mechanism
  - Full February 2026 polling spread (independent: Tisza +7-16pp; government-linked: Fidesz +7-10pp)
  - Expert threshold analysis (Fidesz needs ~45% for supermajority; Tisza needs ~55-57%)
  - Polymarket odds (Magyar 56%, Orban 42%)
  - Polit Pro seat projection (Tisza 99, Fidesz 89, Mi Hazank 11)
  - December 2025 constitutional vote confirming Fidesz still held 134 seats

- **Critical information missed:**
  - No 2024 EP election results analysis as a recent calibration point (Fidesz ~44%, Tisza ~30%) — only briefly mentioned in one DW article
  - No detailed analysis of the 2022 polling miss — mentioned but not deeply examined
  - No district-level analysis or constituency-level seat models

- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Excellent — surfaced Scheppele analysis, Institute of Geoeconomics, Freedom House, The Nation, DW, Hungarian Conservative
  - Agent report: Strong synthesis but overstepped by offering probability estimates
  - AskNews articles: Good breadth across European outlets (Euronews, La Razon, DW, Do Rzeczy); rate limit prevented deep research
  - Question URL scraping: Useful — the NYT/Krugman blog on winner-compensation was directly relevant

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Good coverage of all 8 sources with quality and bias assessments. Correctly identifies Hungarian Conservative as potentially biased. Distinguishes facts from opinions in The Nation article. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 reference classes and correctly selects "Hungarian elections under current system" (3/3). Acknowledges the small sample and current conditions being meaningfully different. Reasonable but doesn't quantify the adjustment from 100% rigorously. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 51-day window and notes polling trends are relatively stable. References historical patterns under the current system. Adequate but brief. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from 100% base rate (3/3 elections), considers both Fidesz and Tisza pathways, arrives at 55%. The derivation is qualitative rather than quantitative — no explicit calculation or Bayesian update. The final estimate of 55% is reasonable given the evidence. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Probability of 55% is defensible. Considered both Yes pathways (Fidesz supermajority likely; Tisza supermajority near-impossible).
- Did not provide a precise quantitative framework for how the 100% base rate was adjusted to 55%.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough coverage of same 8 sources with similar quality assessments. Correctly notes the agent report is a secondary compilation requiring skepticism. Good separation of fact vs. opinion. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Excellent — identifies 4 candidate reference classes including European parliamentary democracies (rightly rejected as too broad) and competitive authoritarian systems (medium suitability). Correctly selects Hungary 2014/2018/2022. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** States 51-52 days. Notes that "in systems with strong mechanical amplification, the key determinant is whether one bloc wins enough SMDs." Identifies late-breaking scandal, opposition coordination, and rule changes as potential disruptors. Good. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Starts from 3/3 = 100%, regresses toward 65-80% range accounting for small-sample and upset risk. Final estimate of 72.6% is well-justified. Clear reasoning about why it should be high but not near-certain. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- 72.6% is a strong outside-view anchor. Properly considers that "any party" includes the remote possibility of an opposition supermajority.
- The calibration discussion is thoughtful: "Even robust incumbencies sometimes fall short of supermajority thresholds without losing outright."

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but accurate. Labels each source with fact/opinion distinction. Notes Hungarian Conservative's "low-to-moderate reliability due to alignment with pro-government ecosystem." Correctly calibrates Agent report as "useful synthesis... warrants skepticism." (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 4 classes including the broader authoritarian-incumbent class (~70-80%). Correctly selects Hungary 2014-2022 as best match. Good evaluation of suitability for each class. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** States 51-52 days. Notes key uncertainties: voter alignment/mobilization, tactical coordination. Observes that structural seat-bonus patterns are features of the conversion mechanism, not temporary. (3/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Strong: starts at 100%, regresses to ~65-80%, centers on low-to-mid 70s. Final estimate of 72.6% matches S1-2 exactly. Clear reasoning for why it shouldn't be >85% but should be meaningfully above 50%. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Nearly identical probability to S1-2 (72.6%), arrived at independently. Good convergence on a well-reasoned outside-view anchor.
- Appropriately notes that upsets are common in electoral politics.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Detailed and methodical. Lists all 8 sources with clear fact/opinion separation. References specific data points (2018: 49.3% vote -> 133 seats; 2022: 53.5% -> 135 seats). Notes that Hungarian Conservative's "interpretation is partisan." (4/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Outstanding — considers 3 candidate classes including all Hungarian elections since 1990 (4/8 = 50%) and elections under current system (3/3 = 100%). Chooses class 2 tempered by broader authoritarian-incumbent class. Uses explicit numerical blending. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 52 days. Notes median late-campaign shift since 2010 is ~2pp. States large late swings (>=6pp) have not occurred in Hungary since 2006. Excellent use of historical volatility data. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Rigorous quantitative approach: blends 100% and 75% with equal weights -> 87.5%. Applies explicit discount factors: -12pp for government trailing in some surveys, -5pp for possible rule change, +3pp for opposition supermajority possibility. Arrives at 73%. Best-structured derivation in the ensemble. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- 73% is well-derived and the most methodologically transparent estimate.
- Correctly notes the asymmetry: supermajority is much easier for Fidesz than any opposition bloc.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Good coverage. Labels each source with quality assessment. Correctly notes Hungarian Conservative's bias and treats Agent report with appropriate caution. (3/4)
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies 3 classes including all Hungarian elections since 1990 (4/8 = 50%), elections under current system (3/3 = 100%), and other European mixed systems (~0%, correctly rejected). Uses Bayesian pseudo-count (Jeffreys prior) to get ~83%. Rigorous. (4/4)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** States 52 days. Notes that in prior cycles, "final seat outcome was highly correlated with polling averages 2 months out provided the governing party was already above ~45% vote share." This is a key nuance. (4/4)
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Bayesian approach: Jeffreys prior gives ~83%, adjusts for structural continuity (+5pp -> 88%), election cancellation risk (x0.98 -> 86%), upset frequency (-8pp -> 78%). Arrives at 78%. Highest outside-view estimate but well-justified through explicit computation. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- 78% is the highest S1 estimate and reflects a strong prior from the structural system.
- The Bayesian pseudo-count approach is the most formally rigorous method used.

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 55% | 12/16 | Balanced consideration of both pathways | Qualitative rather than quantitative derivation |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 62% | 13/16 | Good reference class breadth | Slightly vague adjustment mechanics |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self-model) | 55% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 73% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1 (55%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Comprehensive framework with Strong/Moderate/Weak categories and 11 evidence items. Correctly identifies structural electoral system and historical base rate as strongest evidence for Yes, and independent polling lead as strongest for No. Polymarket signal correctly weighted as moderate. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 55% -> Output: 47%, delta = -8pp). Direction is justified — current polling evidence does suggest some downward revision. Magnitude is reasonable. The update process is transparent with explicit adjustments. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses halved/doubled timeframes. Notes prediction would be "essentially the same" if halved and "might shift slightly toward uncertainty" if doubled. Adequate but brief. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Completes all 6 elements meaningfully. Paraphrase is accurate. Base rate stated. Consistency check ("47 out of 100 times") is reasonable. Key evidence listed. Blind spot identified (2022 polling miss repeating). Status quo considered. (4/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- Update direction (downward from 55%) matches the evidence direction (polling showing Fidesz potentially below threshold).
- Final 47% is internally consistent with the stated reasoning and evidence weighting.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4 (73%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Very detailed framework with 11 evidence items across Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Strong evidence includes the Polit Pro seat projection (Fidesz 89 seats), independent polls, and structural bias. Good use of the DW December 2025 constitutional vote as moderate evidence. (4/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 73% -> Output: 30%, delta = -43pp). This is a very large downward update. The reasoning uses a probability decomposition: P(gov polls accurate)=25%, P(indep polls accurate)=75%, yielding ~20% before blending with base rate. The 25/75 weighting of poll credibility is questionable — it effectively dismisses government-linked polls despite some track record. The magnitude seems too large. (2/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Good — notes halved timeframe would yield "roughly similar or slightly lower" and doubled would "widen the probability distribution." Explicitly connects the 52-day window to polling informativeness. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (73%). Consistency check reasonable. Key evidence listed (5 items). Blind spot: government polls being accurate would make 30% too low. Status quo considered. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The 43pp downward update is among the largest in the ensemble. The probability decomposition approach is methodologically interesting but hinges on the 75%/25% credibility split that may be overconfident about independent polls' accuracy.
- The acknowledgment that "this seems too low given the base rate of 73%" suggests the forecaster recognized the tension but resolved it by heavily weighting current evidence over structural priors.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2 (62%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Well-structured with Strong/Moderate/Weak categories. Correctly identifies structural electoral system and historical pattern as strong evidence for Yes. Notes that the Polit Pro seat model directly addresses resolution criteria. Moderate evidence includes government polls, Polymarket, and the 2022 polling miss. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 62% -> Output: 43%, delta = -19pp). Uses explicit adjustment framework: starts at base, applies adjustments for seat projection, government polls, Mi Hazank vote splitting, and structural advantages. The reasoning is transparent but somewhat unstable — recalculates mid-stream from ~60% down to 43%. (3/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses halved (~26 days: "more predictive; slightly lower") and doubled (~104 days: "more uncertainty; widen"). Notes 52-day window is "short enough that the current polling picture is highly informative." (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with numbered items. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (62%). Consistency check: "43 out of 100 times." Key evidence listed. Blind spot identified (polls systematically wrong, Fidesz sweeps districts). Status quo considered (continued Tisza lead favors "No"). (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- 43% is a moderate update from 62%. The direction is justified by polling evidence.
- The internal recalculation mid-reasoning (going from ~60% down to 43%) suggests some anchoring instability.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 (72.6%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong framework. Lists evidence items with strength tags. Correctly identifies independent polls and Polit Pro seat model as strong evidence against supermajority. Government polls and structural advantages as moderate evidence for. Campaign controversies as weak. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 72.6% -> Output: 38%, delta = -34.6pp). Uses explicit numerical adjustments from 72%: -20pp (unified challenger), -20pp (polling picture), +5pp (structural bias), +2pp (post-election coalition). Arrives at ~40%, then applies "Bayesian dampening for model risk (x0.45)" -> 18%, but catches this and adjusts back up to 38%. The near-application of the arbitrary dampening factor is concerning. (2/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Concise but adequate. Notes halved -> "trim a further 2pp"; doubled -> "add 3pp." Connects to polling predictive power. (3/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (72%). Consistency check: "38 of 100 times." Key evidence listed (5 items). Blind spot: "final-week surge in rural turnout + split in anti-Fidesz vote." Status quo considered. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- The 38% prediction is reasonable but the derivation includes an opaque "Bayesian dampening x0.45" step that was nearly applied before being corrected. This suggests some instability in the reasoning process.

- **Score:** 11/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5 (78%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Clear Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Highlights 5 independent pollsters showing Tisza leading, Polit Pro seat model, and historical low volatility as strong evidence. Government polls and prediction markets as moderate. (3/4)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 78% -> Output: 18%, delta = -60pp). This is an extreme update — the largest in the ensemble by far. Uses explicit adjustments: -25pp (unified challenger), -20pp (polling picture), +5pp (structural bias), +2pp (post-election coalition). This yields 40%. Then applies "Bayesian dampening for model risk (x0.45)" -> 18%. The x0.45 multiplier is arbitrary, unjustified, and makes the final estimate an extreme outlier. (1/4)
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Concise. Halved: "trim a further 2pp." Doubled: "add 3pp." Adequate but minimal. (2/4)
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (78%). Consistency check: "18 out of 100 times, a supermajority happens." Key evidence listed (4 items). Blind spot: "Massive, coordinated last-month smear or rule change swings 5-6pp to Fidesz." Status quo considered. (3/4)

**Question-type-specific assessment:**
- 18% is an extreme outlier. The consistency check ("18 out of 100 times") should have triggered reconsideration — in a system where 3/3 past elections produced supermajorities, and the structural system is specifically designed to produce them, 18% implies this election is radically different from all precedent.
- The x0.45 "Bayesian dampening" factor has no clear derivation and transforms a reasonable 40% estimate into an extreme outlier.

- **Score:** 9/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 55% | 47% | -8pp | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 73% | 30% | -43pp | 12/16 | Partial — too large |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 62% | 43% | -19pp | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 72.6% | 38% | -34.6pp | 11/16 | Partial — dampening arbitrary |
| S2-5 | o3 | 78% | 18% | -60pp | 9/16 | No — extreme and unjustified |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):** S2-2 received S1-4's high outside-view (73%) and made the largest justified update (-43pp to 30%), heavily driven by the Polit Pro seat projection and independent polling. S2-3 received S1-2's moderate outside-view (62%) and updated to 43% (-19pp), a more balanced adjustment. S2-4 received S1-3's high outside-view (72.6%) and updated to 38% (-34.6pp). All three cross-model instances engaged meaningfully with their received outside view, but all shifted in the same direction (down), suggesting the current evidence dominated the cross-pollinated input rather than creating genuine diversity.

- **Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 (Sonnet 4.6, self) made the smallest update (-8pp), staying closest to its outside-view anchor. S2-5 (o3, self) made the largest update (-60pp), which is paradoxical — self-model cross-pollination should theoretically produce more continuity, not less. The extreme S2-5 result reflects an idiosyncratic "Bayesian dampening" factor rather than meaningful engagement with S1-5's reasoning.

- **Diversity impact:** Cross-pollination did not increase diversity in this case. All forecasters moved in the same direction (downward). The final spread (18%-47%) is driven primarily by S2-5's outlier, not by genuine analytical disagreement. Without S2-5, the range would be 30%-47% (17pp), which is still meaningful but much less extreme.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances correctly understood the resolution criteria: any party/coalition acquiring >=133 of 199 seats.
- All correctly identified April 12, 2026 as the election date and the ~52-day forecast window.
- All correctly assessed that a Tisza supermajority is near-impossible, making this effectively a question about whether Fidesz retains 133+ seats.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Fidesz-KDNP won supermajorities in all three elections under the current system (2014: 133, 2018: 134, 2022: 135 seats)
2. The winner-compensation mechanism amplifies the leading party's seat share, with ~45% vote share historically sufficient for supermajority
3. February 2026 polls are sharply divided: independent polls show Tisza ahead by 7-16pp; government-linked polls show Fidesz ahead by 7-10pp
4. Mi Hazank likely to cross the 5% threshold, creating a three-way race
5. Polymarket favors Magyar as next PM at ~56%

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-2 | "Publicus off by 20 points" | This claim from the Hungarian Conservative is stated as fact without independent verification. It may refer to a specific metric or be exaggerated. | Medium |
| S2-3 | Polit Pro as authoritative | Treated as strong evidence despite being based on one model with non-transparent methodology | Medium |

### Hallucinations

No clear hallucinations detected. All key facts (seat counts, poll numbers, expert quotes, dates) are traceable to the provided research sources.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent structural understanding**: All forecasters demonstrated sophisticated understanding of Hungary's electoral system, the winner-compensation mechanism, and why supermajorities are structurally likely in this system.
2. **Strong source analysis**: Consistent, high-quality evaluation of source credibility, with appropriate skepticism toward both partisan polls and partisan media.
3. **Comprehensive evidence framework**: Most forecasters used structured Strong/Moderate/Weak evidence categorization and explicitly traced the direction of each evidence item.

### Weaknesses
1. **Systematic over-discounting of base rate**: Every forecaster shifted dramatically downward from S1->S2. The median S1 estimate was 72.6% and the median S2 estimate was 38%, a 34.6pp drop. This suggests the ensemble systematically over-weighted current polling data relative to structural priors.
2. **Uncritical acceptance of Polit Pro seat model**: All forecasters treated the Polit Pro projection (Fidesz 89, Tisza 99) as near-authoritative despite it being based on independent poll averages that may systematically undercount Fidesz.
3. **S2-5 outlier**: The 18% estimate with its arbitrary x0.45 "Bayesian dampening" is poorly justified and significantly distorts the final aggregate.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

The research quality is excellent and the outside-view analysis is among the best in the assessment corpus. The weakness lies in the inside-view updates, where all forecasters shifted too aggressively in the same direction, and one extreme outlier (S2-5 at 18%) drags the final aggregate down. The final prediction of 35.2% may be somewhat too low given the structural system and historical base rate, but the core reasoning is sound and the evidence gathering is thorough.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- Add a dedicated query for seat-projection models from multiple sources (not just Polit Pro) to triangulate the seat estimate
- Search specifically for analysis of the 2022 polling miss to calibrate how much to trust current polling divergences
- Include the 2024 European Parliament results as a recent calibration data point (Fidesz ~44%, Tisza ~30%)

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- Consider adding a "maximum allowable update" guardrail: when the S1->S2 shift exceeds some threshold (e.g., 30pp), require the forecaster to explicitly justify why the inside view evidence warrants such a large revision from a well-reasoned base rate
- The Agent research prompt should include instructions to avoid providing probability estimates, keeping the output factual

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.6** (S2-1): Best-calibrated inside-view update (-8pp). Produced the most balanced final estimate.
- **Sonnet 4.6** (S2-2): Over-corrected (-43pp) due to a 75/25 credibility split favoring independent polls that may not be warranted.
- **GPT-5.2** (S2-3): Solid middle-ground reasoning but the mid-stream recalculation from ~60% to 43% suggests anchoring instability.
- **o3** (S2-4): The "Bayesian dampening" factor nearly caused the same extreme output as S2-5. The factor was caught and corrected here but not in S2-5.
- **o3** (S2-5): The x0.45 dampening factor is the primary issue. o3 appears prone to applying ad hoc mathematical transformations that aren't well-grounded. This should be monitored across other forecasts.

## 8. Comparison Flags

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Output spread >30pp (binary) | Nearly (29pp) | 18%-47%; would be 17pp without S2-5 outlier |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates were downward, consistent with polling evidence direction |
| Factual errors present | Minor | "Publicus off by 20 points" claim unverified independently |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | No | All outputs shifted in same direction; no diversity generated |
| Critical info missed in research | Partial | 2024 EP election results not analyzed; district-level models absent |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | All base rate derivations were methodologically sound |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | S2-5 at 18% is a clear outlier |
