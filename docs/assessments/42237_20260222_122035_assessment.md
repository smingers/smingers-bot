## Critical Issues Summary

**Complete this section FIRST after reading all artifacts. List the most significant problems that affected forecast quality.**

**Note:** Methodological diversity and forecast spread are NOT inherently issues. Only flag instances where reasoning is flawed, evidence is misinterpreted, or analytical tools are misapplied to the specific question.

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Resolution window misinterpretation: **S2-3 (inside view)** treated "Events before this date do not count" (forecast opening Feb 22) as meaning only deaths from Feb 22 onward count toward the 900 threshold, requiring ~900 deaths in ~38 days (~24/day) instead of YTD through Mar 31. S1-3 (outside view) had the correct window (Jan 1–Mar 31) and gave 14.7% from a conservative historical prior; the wrong window was introduced in S2-3 | Critical | S2-3 | Resolution criteria state "year-to-date sum of dead plus missing through the end of March 2026 for 'Mediterranean' is at least 900" — i.e. Jan 1–Mar 31. S2-3's interpretation produced 14% vs majority 60–98%; supervisor correctly resolved this and set 82%. |
| AskNews deep research hit usage limit (403) during current search | Med | Research | "Error running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012" in search_current.json; inside-view research lacked deep-research layer. |
| Mid-February daily rate slowdown underweighted by S1-1/S1-2 | Low | S1-1, S1-2, S2-1, S2-2 | Data showed ~3.6/day Feb 11–22 (524→567) vs ~12.8/day through Feb 10; S2-4 and supervisor explicitly incorporated this. High forecasters (98%, 93%) did not adjust for slowdown risk. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical); Yes (supervisor) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (current; deep research failed) |
| FRED / yFinance / Google Trends | No | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes | No | Yes (implied by search content) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (from `query_historical.md`):
1. "Mediterranean migrant deaths March 2025 IOM" (Google)
2. "2026 Mediterranean migrant deaths to-date" (Google News)
3. "Retrieve IOM Missing Migrants Mediterranean cumulative deaths Jan 1–Mar 31 for each year 2016-2025 and current 2026 total." (Agent)

**Current Queries** (from `query_current.md`):
1. "Missing Migrants 2026 Mediterranean deaths" (Google)
2. "Mediterranean shipwreck February 2026 death toll" (Google News)
3. "Provide the latest 2026 year-to-date death and missing figures for Mediterranean crossings from IOM's Missing Migrants Project and summarize major fatal incidents reported in January and February 2026." (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Q1 by year (2016–2025), 2026 YTD | 2026 YTD, recent incidents (Jan–Feb) |
| Content type | IOM cumulative totals, annual/Q1 patterns | IOM updates, incident reports (Cyclone Harry, Zuwara, Crete) |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Agent report: 524 by Feb 10, rate ~12.8/day, projection 900–1,150+ Q1; historical annual totals | Independent 567 by Feb 22; AFP/IOM 567 central Med; Crete capsizing; 375 Jan alone |

**Analysis:**
- Historical queries established 524 dead/missing Jan 1–Feb 10 (IOM/Le Monde), annual totals, and Agent projection. Current queries confirmed 567 (The Independent, AFP), 375 in January alone (Al Jazeera/IOM), and ongoing incidents (Crete, Libya). Good separation.
- Historical research correctly framed the question as YTD through Mar 31; Agent report stated "year-to-date sum" and projected Q1 2026. Current research did not contradict this.
- Critical numbers (524, 567, 375, 484, 53 off Zuwara, Cyclone Harry ~380 missing) were surfaced and used by forecasters. AskNews deep research was unavailable.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report (historical) concludes "Verdict: YES — with very high confidence" and "Probability assessment: >97%." That blurs into forecasting; forecasters appropriately used it as evidence (524, rates, trajectory) rather than adopting its probability. Other summaries stay factual.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** 524 Jan 1–Feb 10 (IOM/Le Monde); 567 Mediterranean by ~Feb 20–22 (Independent, AFP); 375 January alone (IOM/Al Jazeera); 484 central Med by Feb 9; Zuwara 53; Cyclone Harry ~380 missing (MRCC); Crete Feb 21 (5+ dead, ~20 missing); IOM "worst start to a year in over a decade"; historical annual totals and Q1 comparators.
- **Critical information missed:** None identified. Supervisor queries later confirmed YTD interpretation and dataset filterability.
- **Source quality by tool:** Agent synthesis and IOM-attributed figures (Le Monde, Independent, AFP, Al Jazeera) were high value. NGO estimates (e.g. 1,000 feared missing) were correctly treated as upper bounds.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Evaluates 7+ sources (ECRE, Euronews, Al Jazeera, Vatican News, New Humanitarian, Euro-Med/Mirage, Agent); distinguishes IOM-attributed figures (524, 375) from NGO estimates; notes "year-to-date sum" and "Mediterranean" match resolution.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Offers "annual Q1 Mediterranean deaths," "years with exceptional early mortality events"; selects the latter given 524 by Feb 10 and IOM "unprecedented."
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Resolution April 1; 524 by Feb 10; ~38 days remaining; at 12/day projects 1,112; at 7/day crosses 900.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Only 376 more needed over 49 days (7.7/day) vs established 12.8/day; "No" would require near-zero deaths for 5+ weeks; 98.5%.

**Question-type-specific:** Binary 98.5%; Yes/No pathways clear; considers data revision/definition as ~1% uncertainty.

- **Score:** 15/16 (strong; minor rounding without explicit slowdown scenario)

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Same sources; "524 dead/missing 1 Jan–10 Feb (IOM)" and "≥375 in January (IOM)" as key anchors; distinguishes advocacy from IOM data.
- **Reference Class Selection:** "Mediterranean Q1 death trajectories when early-year pace is high"; 2026 above any comparable period.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** ~37 days left; 524+ by Feb 10, likely 550–600+ by Feb 22; need ~300–330 more; 8–9.5/day required vs 12.8/day established.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** "Even at 50% of established pace" threshold nearly met; only "No" is near-complete cessation for 37 days; 97.5%.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough (ECRE, Euronews, Al Jazeera, Vatican, New Humanitarian, Euro-Med, Agent); notes Agent projections are "inside-view trend extrapolation" not outside-view baserates; "year-to-date" and seasonality discussed.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Chooses "annual totals + typical Q1 share"; concludes Q1 ≥900 is "historically rare but not impossible," ~10–20% long-run, nudged to mid-teens for variance.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** **Correct:** Explicitly states "Outcome window (as written in resolution criteria): **Jan 1–Mar 31, 2026** (Q1), resolving Apr 1, 2026." Treats Q1 as a whole seasonal period; "900 by end of March" is a high threshold historically.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** From annual totals and Q1 share (~15–30% of annual), Q1 ≥ 900 is ~10–20% long-run; variance and uncertainty push to mid-teens → 14.7%. Conservative but correctly windowed.

- **Score:** 13/16 (source and reference-class work good; timeframe correct; base rate is conservative and light on using the strong 2026 YTD data — 524/567 — which other forecasters used to lift probability)

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Six sources with dates and quality; only IOM- or authority-attributed numbers trusted (524 by 10 Feb, 375 January); Euro-Med "524 Jan 1–Feb 5" aligned with others.
- **Reference Class Selection:** "Share of Q1 deaths already recorded by 10 February"; 2016/2025 ratio ~0.50–0.55; projects Q1 ≈950–1,050; conservative 0.60 multiplier still gives 874 + 30 ≈ 904.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 38 days; 376 needed; 9.9/day required; historical Feb 11–Mar 31 in active years 5–10/day; seasonality supports 8/day.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 92% with explicit data-lag and slowdown risk (7–10% joint probability of missing 900).

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Seven sources; 524 and 375 as IOM anchors; "ratio method" from 1 Jan–10 Feb to 1 Jan–31 Mar.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Multiplier from early-Feb to end-Mar (median 1.7, mean 1.9); P(multiplier ≥1.72) ≈55%; adds record start and Cyclone Harry clustering; subtracts model/lag uncertainty → 67%.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 38 days remain; 35–45% of Q1 deaths typically after 22 Feb; ample time for incidents.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 45–60% from ratios; +20 for record start, −5 for lag/uncertainty; 67%.

- **Score:** 15/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 98.5% | 15/16 | Clear math (7.7/day needed vs 12.8), IOM anchors | No explicit mid-Feb slowdown |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 97.5% | 15/16 | Same; "likely 550–600+ by Feb 22" | Same |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self) | 98.5% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 92% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | 97.5% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 14.7% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self) | 67% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments (abbreviated)

- **S2-1:** Keeps 98%; cites 567 by Feb 20, 590+ by Feb 22, 8.1/day needed; checklist complete. **Score:** 15/16.
- **S2-2:** 92% → 93%; Independent 567, pace 11.1/day, 333 needed in 37 days; reporting lag risk 5–8%. **Score:** 15/16.
- **S2-3:** **Introduces resolution error:** S1-3 had correctly used Jan 1–Mar 31. S2-3 paraphrases window as "from forecast opening 2026-02-22 through end of 2026-03-31" (citing "events before this date do not count"); 900 in ~38 days ≈24/day; 14%. Receives 97.5% but rejects it because it wrongly treats pre–Feb 22 deaths as not counting. **Score:** 5/16 (evidence weighting and checklist present but built on wrong criteria introduced in this step).
- **S2-4:** Receives 14.7%; **correctly** treats YTD (567 by Feb 22, 333 needed, 9.0/day); incorporates Cyclone Harry verification lag and "sharp fall in daily rate mid-Feb (~3.6/day)"; 60%. **Score:** 15/16.
- **S2-5:** 67% → 72%; 567 baseline, multiplier model, +3 (trend) +4 (March) +2 (Harry) −3 (lag) −1 (Ramadan). **Score:** 15/16.

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 98.5% | 98% | −0.5 | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 92% | 93% | +1 | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 97.5% | 14% | −83.5 | 5/16 | No (introduced wrong window in S2; rejected correct view) |
| S2-4 | o3 | 14.7% | 60% | +45.3 | 15/16 | Yes (correct YTD interpretation) |
| S2-5 | o3 | 67% | 72% | +5 | 15/16 | Yes |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- **S2-2** (receives S1-4 at 92%): Stayed at 93%; consistent with shared YTD interpretation and strong data.
- **S2-3** (receives S1-2 at 97.5%): **Introduced** the wrong window: S1-3 had correctly used Jan 1–Mar 31. S2-3 reinterpreted "events before this date do not count" as defining the resolution window (Feb 22–Mar 31 only), rejected the 97.5% as "misaligned," and kept 14%. The error originated in S2-3, not in the received outside view.
- **S2-4** (receives S1-3 at 14.7%): **Meaningfully engaged:** Used the low base as a prior but applied correct YTD window and evidence (567, 9/day needed, Cyclone Harry backfill, mid-Feb slowdown) → 60%. Demonstrates correct resolution reading and evidence weighting.
- **S2-5** (self): Raised 67% → 72% on current data and multiplier.
- **Conclusion:** Cross-pollination worked where resolution was shared (S2-2, S2-5). S2-4 correctly overrode S1-3’s wrong window. S2-3’s error was criteria-based, not fixable by receiving another forecaster’s number.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- **All five** forecasters' **outside views (S1)** used or implied the correct resolution window: IOM dataset, **year-to-date** sum of dead+missing through **end of March 2026** for "Mediterranean" ≥ 900. S1-3 explicitly states "Outcome window (as written in resolution criteria): **Jan 1–Mar 31, 2026** (Q1)." Primary source: missingmigrants.iom.int/region/mediterranean.
- **S2-3 (inside view only)** misinterpreted "Events before this date do not count" (forecast opening Feb 22) as defining the resolution window, thus counting only deaths from Feb 22–Mar 31. The resolution criteria text explicitly says "year-to-date sum … through the end of March 2026," which is Jan 1–Mar 31. The error was introduced in the inside-view step, not carried over from S1-3.
- Timeframe (resolve April 1; data through Mar 31) was otherwise stated correctly.

### Factual Consensus

1. IOM reported 524 dead/missing Jan 1–Feb 10, 2026 (Le Monde, Euro-Med, Agent).
2. By ~Feb 20–22, IOM/MMP figure was 567 Mediterranean (Independent, AFP).
3. January 2026 alone: at least 375 dead/missing in central Mediterranean (IOM via Al Jazeera). Zuwara Feb 6: 53; Crete Feb 21: 5+ dead, ~20 missing.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-3 | Resolution window | Treated resolution as Feb 22–Mar 31 only (introduced in inside view; S1-3 had correct Jan 1–Mar 31) | Critical: produced 14% vs correct YTD interpretation |

### Hallucinations

None identified. Incident counts and IOM attributions match the research pack.

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review

### Divergence & Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Divergence metric | std_dev |
| Divergence value | 33.61 |
| Trigger threshold | 15 (binary) |
| Supervisor triggered? | Yes |
| Supervisor model | Claude Opus 4.6 |
| Supervisor confidence | HIGH |
| Supervisor cost | $0.27 |

### Stage 1: Disagreement Analysis

**Quality of disagreement identification:** The supervisor correctly identified the main split: **resolution window** (S2-3 at 14% vs others 60–98%). It characterized Forecaster 3 (S2-3) as interpreting the window as "only deaths from Feb 22 onward" and the others as "year-to-date (Jan 1–Mar 31) cumulative total." (Note: S1-3 had in fact used the correct Jan 1–Mar 31 window and gave 14.7% from a conservative prior; the Feb 22–only reading was introduced in S2-3.) The supervisor also identified (2) IOM verification lag for Cyclone Harry missing (~380) and (3) recent daily rate (mid-Feb slowdown vs overall pace). Root causes were correctly tagged: criteria interpretation vs factual (lag, rate).

### Stage 1: Search Query Quality

| # | Query | Source | Targets Which Disagreement? | Redundant with Round 1? |
|---|-------|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | IOM Missing Migrants Mediterranean 2026 deaths February | Google News | Rate, current total | Partial (current round had similar) |
| 2 | IOM Missing Migrants Project data update frequency verification lag | Google | Lag for missing persons | No (new) |
| 3 | What is the current IOM Missing Migrants Project year-to-date total for Mediterranean dead and missing as of late February 2026, and does the dataset allow filtering by incident date to show only incidents from February 22 onward? Also, have the missing persons from recent large incidents (e.g., boats lost during storms in early-mid February) been added to the dataset yet? | Agent | Window + lag | No (directly targets criteria and lag) |
| 4 | IOM Mediterranean missing boats Cyclone Harry 2026 | Google News | Harry verification | Partial |

**Assessment:** Queries 2 and 3 were well targeted at resolvable factual/criteria issues. Query 3 explicitly asked whether the dataset allows filtering by incident date (Feb 22 onward) and confirmed YTD total — directly supporting resolution of the window dispute.

### Stage 2: Supervisor Research Quality

**Novelty:** Supervisor research reiterated 524 (Feb 10), 567 (Feb 22), 533 (Feb 16), and confirmed dataset is filterable by incident date and region; data lag and underreporting were discussed. No major new figure beyond round 1; the **clarification** that "year-to-date sum" is Jan 1–Mar 31 and that the dataset tracks YTD was the key output.

**Relevance:** Directly relevant to (1) window interpretation and (2) lag/verification.

### Stage 2: Supervisor Reasoning & Reconciliation

**Reasoning quality:** Supervisor stated that "year-to-date sum" unambiguously means Jan 1–Mar 31 and that the metadata "Forecast Opening Date" refers to when forecasting opens, not the resolution window. It sided with the majority (correct) interpretation. It then addressed lag (partially resolved: 567 by Feb 22 shows substantial verification) and rate (524→533→567 implies ~3.6/day Feb 10–22, but YTD ~10.7/day). Scenario analysis: if March returns to ~12/day → 1,011; if ~9/day → 900; if stays ~4/day → 715. It balanced YTD pace, likely March increase, and Cyclone Harry backfill against mid-Feb slowdown and verification lag → **82%**.

**Reconciliation approach:** It did not simply split the difference; it rejected the wrong criteria reading (introduced in S2-3) and re-anchored on correct YTD math (Jan 1–Mar 31), then applied a modest discount from the highest (93–98%) for slowdown and lag → 82%. Confidence HIGH was appropriate.

**Supervisor Score:** 15/16 (strong disagreement ID, targeted queries, correct resolution of window, sound 82% with clear rationale; minor: research mostly reinforced round 1 rather than adding many new facts).

### Supervisor Impact Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Ensemble weighted average (pre-supervisor) | 67.4% |
| Supervisor prediction (post-supervisor) | 82% |
| Adjustment magnitude | +14.6 pp |
| Was the adjustment an improvement? | Yes — corrected for one forecaster’s critical resolution-window error; 82% is well-justified given YTD 567 and required ~9/day. |

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Research:** Strong IOM-anchored numbers (524, 567, 375), multiple reputable sources, Agent synthesis, and supervisor follow-up on criteria and lag.
2. **Majority reasoning:** S1-1, S1-2, S1-4, S1-5 and S2-1, S2-2, S2-4, S2-5 used correct YTD window and sensible rates/multipliers.
3. **Supervisor:** Correctly identified and resolved the resolution-window disagreement; targeted queries; 82% with clear scenario analysis and HIGH confidence.
4. **Cross-pollination:** S2-4 meaningfully overrode S1-3’s wrong prior with correct criteria and evidence (60%).

### Weaknesses

1. **Critical criteria error:** S2-3 (inside view) misinterpreted the resolution window as Feb 22–Mar 31 only (S1-3 had correctly used Jan 1–Mar 31), producing 14% and large spread (84 pp).
2. **AskNews limit:** Deep research unavailable for current round.
3. **Mid-Feb slowdown:** Some high forecasters (98%, 93%) did not explicitly model the ~3.6/day Feb 11–22 slowdown; supervisor and S2-4 did.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B+**

Research and majority reasoning were strong; resolution criteria were correctly applied by four of five forecasters and by the supervisor. The critical error in S1-3/S2-3 was cleanly identified and corrected by the supervisor, and the final 82% is well-justified. The single critical error and the 84 pp spread (driven by that error) prevent an A.

---

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

- Monitor AskNews usage to avoid silent loss of deep research.
- For resolution-critical questions, consider a single explicit "resolution criteria" check query (e.g. "IOM Missing Migrants: what does year-to-date through March 2026 mean for Mediterranean?") to reduce criteria misinterpretation risk.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

- In the prompt or fine_print, explicitly state that "year-to-date" or "through end of March" means **January 1 through March 31**, and that "Events before this date do not count" refers to the **forecast opening date** for scoring, not to which incidents count toward the resolution metric. This would reduce the chance of a repeat of Forecaster 3’s reading.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- GPT-5.2 (S2-3): In the inside-view step, resolution criteria must be read from the question’s resolution_criteria field; "Events before this date do not count" in tournament metadata refers to forecast opening, not to the definition of the outcome variable. S1-3 had the correct window (Jan 1–Mar 31); S2-3 introduced the wrong Feb 22–Mar 31 reading. When in doubt, prefer the explicit wording ("year-to-date sum … through the end of March 2026") over metadata fine print.
