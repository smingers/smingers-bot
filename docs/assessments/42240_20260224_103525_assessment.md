# FORECAST QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| GPT-5.2 "near threshold = coin flip" error | Critical | S1-3 | GPT-5.2 arrived at 41.8% from a 0/12 base rate by reasoning that "when a process sits near a threshold, small scheduling choices can flip the outcome" — confusing proximity to the resolution boundary with genuine 50/50 uncertainty. No causal mechanism was provided for why 0/12 historical cases would suddenly become ~40%. |
| Cross-pollination amplified rather than corrected | High | S2-4 | o3 received S1-3's inflated 41.8% and further elevated it to 66%. While o3's structural reasoning is valid (April 9 = second Thursday + 33-day rule), starting from a contaminated 41.8% base produced an over-inflated final estimate. |
| AskNews returned entirely irrelevant results | Medium | Research | All 10+ AskNews articles about "Cannes 2026 lineup unveiling date" returned Cannes Lions, AI festivals, and staffing articles — zero articles about Official Selection announcement timing. The current research stage provided no actionable signal for this question. |
| Large supervisor revision without explicit justification for magnitude | Low | Supervisor | Supervisor moved from 25.6% ensemble to 50%, nearly doubling the probability — but did not fully explain why such a large upward revision was warranted rather than a more moderate adjustment toward ~40%. |

## Summary

- **Question ID:** 42240
- **Question Title:** Will the Cannes Film Festival publish its 2026 official selection before April 10, 2026?
- **Question Type:** binary
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-04-10
- **Forecast Window:** 45 days
- **Final Prediction:** 50% (supervisor override of 25.6% ensemble)
- **Step 2 Predictions:** S2-1: 4%, S2-2: 9%, S2-3: 4%, S2-4: 66%, S2-5: 45%
- **Spread:** 62 percentage points (4% to 66%); std_dev = 28.36
- **Total Cost:** $1.60 (ensemble) + $0.60 (supervisor) = $2.20
- **Duration:** 385 seconds
- **One-sentence quality assessment:** The two o3 instances independently discovered the key structural insight (April 9, 2026 is the second Thursday and 33 days before May 12), the supervisor correctly resolved the ensemble disagreement, but GPT-5.2's fundamental reasoning error — treating threshold proximity as genuine uncertainty — introduced a critical flaw that one cross-pollination instance amplified rather than corrected.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes (both stages) |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes (both stages) |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical only) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (current only) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No (not relevant) |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No (not relevant) |
| Google Trends | If relevant | No | No (not relevant) |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (Cannes press releases URL in resolution criteria) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries:**
1. `Cannes 2025 official selection press release date` (Google)
2. `Cannes official selection announced April 2024` (Google News)
3. `Give publication dates of Cannes Film Festival "Official Selection" press releases from 2014-2025 and note whether each was before 10 April. Also mention any years with delayed announcements and reasons.` (Agent)

**Current Queries:**
1. `Cannes 2026 official selection announcement` (Google)
2. `Cannes 2026 lineup unveiling date` (Google News)
3. `Provide recent February 2026 film-industry reports indicating when the Cannes Film Festival will announce the 2026 Official Selection list, citing any statements from festival officials or press releases.` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2014–2025 announcement dates | Feb 2026 trade press, official statements |
| Content type | Official press releases, trade reports | Recent news, any pre-announcements |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Established 0/12 base rate; year-by-year dates confirmed by Agent report | Confirmed no announcement yet; found festival May 12–23 dates |

**Analysis:**

The two query sets are appropriately discrete. Historical queries correctly target base rate establishment — the Agent query in particular is excellent: it asks for the entire 2014–2025 dataset with annotation about pre-April 10 status. This produced a comprehensive year-by-year agent report that became the primary evidence base for all five forecasters.

Current queries correctly targeted the right information (any pre-announcement of 2026 press conference date), but found nothing useful. The AskNews query was well-formulated but the tool returned entirely irrelevant articles — Cannes Lions, AI events, and staffing articles. This was likely a tool coverage gap, not a query design failure.

The Agent query used in historical research could also have been deployed for the current phase (e.g., "have any trade publications or Cannes officials mentioned the 2026 press conference date?"), which might have surface more relevant results than AskNews did.

One notable absence: the research did not identify the specific day of the week for each historical announcement date, which turned out to be the crucial insight. Forecasters 4 and 5 (o3) independently computed this from the Agent report dates, but an explicit query like "what day of the week did each announcement fall on?" would have made this visible to all forecasters.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report stayed factual, providing a year-by-year table of announcement dates with notes on COVID disruptions. It correctly concluded "no announcement before April 10 in any normal year" without assigning probability estimates. This is appropriate — research should inform, not forecast.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** Complete 2014–2025 announcement date history; 2025 announcement was April 10 (earliest on record); 2024 was April 11; 2026 festival confirmed for May 12–23; no pre-announcement of 2026 selection date as of Feb 24, 2026.
- **Critical information missed:** Day-of-week pattern for historical announcements was not explicitly surfaced (though derivable from dates). No result confirming the "second Thursday of April" pattern or the 33-day lead time rule — both had to be inferred by individual forecasters from the Agent report data.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News: Good — surfaced high-quality trade articles (Screen Daily, Deadline, Le Monde) confirming 2024 and 2025 announcement dates
  - Agent report: Excellent — comprehensive year-by-year synthesis was the single most valuable research output for this question
  - AskNews articles: Poor — all articles were irrelevant; returned zero actionable intelligence about 2026 announcement timing

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** 4/4 — Evaluates all 7 sources with explicit quality ratings (high/medium/low), distinguishes fact from speculation (IndieWire vs. Le Monde), identifies Agent report as useful but noting approximate dates. Well-structured.
- **Reference Class Selection:** 4/4 — Identifies three reference classes (direct Cannes dates, major festival timing, institutional change), clearly evaluates fit, selects direct Cannes 2014–2025 as most suitable with strong justification.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 3/4 — Correctly identifies 45-day window, notes April 10 threshold, describes trend from April 17 (2014) to April 10 (2025). Minor gap: does not identify April 9 as a Thursday or calculate the 33-day lead time from the May 12 opening.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 3/4 — 0/12 clearly stated; upward adjustment to 4% is reasonable but without explicit Laplace formula. Correctly notes that non-zero probability is warranted due to trend and genuine uncertainty.

**Binary-specific:** Derived 4% from 0% base rate with trend adjustment. Considered both Yes (trend continuation) and No (structural constraints, leadership continuity) pathways explicitly. Probability is consistent with the stated evidence.

**Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** 4/4 — Thorough evaluation of all 7 sources, similar quality to S1-1. Adds pandemic-adjusted class explicitly.
- **Reference Class Selection:** 3/4 — Uses pandemic-adjusted base (0/10 excluding 2020–21) which is sensible but doesn't evaluate alternative classes as thoroughly; simply states they are "less suitable."
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 3/4 — Correctly identifies window, trend, and 45-day remaining. Notes "roughly one day earlier per year on average" trend. Does not identify the Thursday pattern or 33-day rule.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 3/4 — 0/12 (or 0/10 pandemic-adjusted) clearly stated; 3.5% final estimate is reasonable and appropriately calibrated. No explicit Laplace calculation.

**Binary-specific:** 3.5% is tightly reasoned and consistent. Explicitly notes "April 10 itself would not count" — good precision about resolution criteria. Considers both pathways.

**Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** 3/4 — Good source evaluation overall; appropriately flags the Agent report dates as "~" approximations requiring caution. Slightly redundant in listing the same sources as others but adds nuance about reliability.
- **Reference Class Selection:** 3/4 — Uses two classes with a "recency-weighted modifier" — a sophisticated approach. However, the weighting methodology is implicit rather than explicit.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 2/4 — **Significant flaw:** Correctly identifies the 45-day window but then draws the wrong inference. The output states "because the threshold is only 0–1 days away from the recent norm, I assign a substantial (but <50/50?) chance of being earlier." This confuses resolution boundary proximity with genuine 50/50 uncertainty — the question cutoff of April 10 was presumably chosen to be near the historical range precisely to be a close call for *humans*, but that doesn't mean the event has a ~50% probability of occurring before it.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 1/4 — **Critical error:** Explicitly states "Despite zero prior instances strictly before April 10, I treat 'before April 10' in 2026 as a meaningful upset risk, not a tail event" — then assigns 41.8%. The reasoning that the process is "near a threshold" does not provide a causal mechanism for why a 0/12 historical rate suddenly becomes ~40%. No Laplace correction, no structural mechanism, no conditional probability tree — just assertion that proximity to the threshold means coin-flip-like odds.

**Binary-specific:** 41.8% is flagrantly inconsistent with the stated evidence. The output acknowledges 0 prior instances but produces a near-moderate probability. This is a fundamental calibration failure: treating the resolution question's design as evidence about the event's probability.

**Score:** 9/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** 4/4 — Clean, structured evaluation of all 7 sources. Concise and accurate quality assessments.
- **Reference Class Selection:** 4/4 — Explicitly identifies 3 reference classes, selects Class 1 (all Cannes normal years 2014–2025) as most germane with clear justification. Notes Class 3 (pandemic years) as atypical.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 4/4 — Excellent: calculates ~9.4 Apr 2026 expected date from linear drift, correctly notes that April 9 is a Thursday in 2026 ("2026 calendar shows 9 Apr is a Thursday"), uses conditional probability framing for whether trend continues.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 4/4 — Applies Laplace correction explicitly (1/(n+2) = 1/12 ≈ 8%); builds a conditional probability tree: P(Cannes tries earlier date) × P(that date < Apr 10 | trying earlier) × P(drift continues) = 0.30 × 0.70 × 0.50 ≈ 10%; correctly rounds to 9%.

**Binary-specific:** 9% is the most analytically rigorous S1 estimate. Explicitly notes "I am forecasting true probability, not hedging." Accounts for Laplace, structural drift, and Thursday alignment.

**Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** 4/4 — Provides an explicit 10-year table of announcement dates with year, date, and trend summary. More detailed factual grounding than other instances.
- **Reference Class Selection:** 3/4 — Identifies 3 classes, selects most suitable, but doesn't evaluate fit of alternatives in as much depth as S1-4.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 3/4 — Lists all 10 data points, calculates σ ≈ 2.4 days, notes "non-pandemic outliers only skew later, never earlier." Good statistical foundation but doesn't compute the Thursday alignment or 33-day lead time.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 3/4 — Explicit +2%+2%+1% adjustments summing to 5%; correctly accounts for asymmetry (cut in half from 10% because direction must be earlier). Reasonable but less mathematically rigorous than S1-4.

**Binary-specific:** 5% is well-calibrated for an outside view. Explicitly considers structural continuity (same leadership), possible upside shocks, and historical asymmetry (force-majeure only pushed later, never earlier).

**Score:** 13/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 4% | 14/16 | Thorough source evaluation, appropriate calibration | Didn't discover April 9 Thursday pattern |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 3.5% | 13/16 | Good pandemic-adjusted base rate; precise about resolution criteria | Same gap as S1-1 on structural analysis |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 41.8% | 9/16 | Careful source quality flags; recency-weighted class | Fundamental error: treats threshold proximity as coin-flip uncertainty |
| S1-4 | o3 | 9% | 16/16 | Laplace correction, conditional probability tree, identifies Thursday alignment | Minor: conditional probabilities somewhat speculative |
| S1-5 | o3 | 5% | 13/16 | Explicit data table, σ calculation, asymmetry correction | Doesn't fully leverage structural calendar insight |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self-model) | 4% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 9% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | 3.5% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 41.8% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 5% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** 4/4 — Correctly labels 0/12 history as Strong, festival timing as Moderate, trend as Weak. Correctly identifies that all current AskNews/Google articles are irrelevant to timing.
- **Update from Base Rate:** 4% → 4%, Δ = 0. Correct: "No current sources indicate any deviation from historical norms for 2026." Current information provides no evidence to shift from the base rate. No update is the right update.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 3/4 — Explicitly addresses halved (~March 17 → near 0%) and doubled (~May 20 → 95%+). Good conceptual coverage but brief.
- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 — All 6 elements meaningful: paraphrase of resolution criteria, base rate stated (0% raw → 4% adjusted), consistency check ("4 out of 100"), five key evidence items with strength ratings, blind spot (strategic early announcement), status quo check.

**Binary-specific:** No update direction error. The 4% final probability is internally consistent with the stated reasoning. Maintains appropriate conservatism given no new evidence.

**Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** 4/4 — Same Strong/Moderate/Weak framework applied correctly. Notes the received o3 outside view at 9% includes Laplace correction and structural analysis.
- **Update from Base Rate:** 9% → 9%, Δ = 0. Correctly assesses: "+2-3% for secular trend, -1-2% for absence of signals ≈ neutral." Appropriate maintenance of the received base rate.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 3/4 — Same halved/doubled analysis as S2-1; adequate but not deeply analytical.
- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 — All elements present, including the important blind spot: "If Cannes decided to move significantly earlier due to competitive pressure from other festivals or streaming platforms, my forecast would look too low."

**Binary-specific:** Correct recognition that the received outside view (o3's 9%) was the most rigorously derived, and maintaining it in the absence of new evidence is correct. The Sonnet 4.6 instance appropriately engaged with and accepted the o3 structural analysis.

**Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** 4/4 — Comprehensive and accurate: lists 21 AskNews articles with quality ratings, correctly classifies all as irrelevant to timing. Identifies historical pattern as Strong, trend as Moderate, absence of signals as Moderate.
- **Update from Base Rate:** 3.5% → 4%, Δ = +0.5%. Correct direction and appropriate minimal magnitude given no new evidence. This is GPT-5.2 self-correcting from its S1-3 error of 41.8% — the conservative 3.5% anchor from Sonnet 4.6 pulled GPT-5.2 back to appropriate calibration.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 3/4 — Same halved (near 0%) / doubled (95%+) analysis; adequate.
- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 — Explicit and thorough: paraphrase, base rate 3.5%, consistency line "4 out of 100," 4 key evidence items, blind spot (Cannes could publish a "first wave"), status quo tilt.

**Binary-specific:** GPT-5.2's self-correction to 4% after receiving Sonnet 4.6's conservative outside view demonstrates that cross-pollination can effectively override a model's natural prior. However, this creates a troubling asymmetry: GPT-5.2 gave 41.8% from its own outside view but 4% when given someone else's — suggesting the model's anchoring is highly sensitive to the received input.

**Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** 3/4 — Applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong: 33-day lead time (2024, 2025), Thursday day-of-week preference, festival opens May 12; Moderate: festival logistical routines. The structural calendar argument is correctly classified as strong. However, the absence of any current evidence about a 2026 press conference date isn't explicitly labeled as meaningful (should reduce probability somewhat).
- **Update from Base Rate:** 41.8% → 66%, Δ = +24.2%. Directionally consistent with the structural argument (April 9 is convergently predicted), but the magnitude is inflated because it starts from GPT-5.2's already-inflated 41.8%. The structural argument is genuine, but if starting from a 9% base (like S1-4), an update to ~66% would represent a 57pp jump — extremely large. Starting from 41.8%, the 24pp further jump appears more moderate but isn't.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 3/4 — Notes that with 45 days remaining, "if the horizon were halved (≈22 days), probability would fall ~10 pts." Provides genuine directional analysis, though brief.
- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 — All 8 elements present: title re-stated, base rate referenced, consistency line ("66 out of 100"), five key facts listed, blind spot (Paris security event), status quo bias check (correcting "mechanical anchoring on 10 Apr").

**Binary-specific:** The structural reasoning in S2-4 is actually the strongest analytical work in the ensemble — o3 independently verified that April 9 is the second Thursday AND is 33 days before May 12, confirmed 4 consecutive years of the pattern, and identified the 2019 exception. The 66% probability itself may be in the right neighborhood (supervisor later arrived at 50%), but the path to that estimate was compromised by GPT-5.2's contaminated starting point.

**Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** 4/4 — Correctly identifies Strong evidence (Thursday pattern, 8/9 recent years = second Thursday of April), Moderate evidence (same leadership, May 12–23 festival dates), Weak evidence (Easter timing, digital-first speculation).
- **Update from Base Rate:** 5% → 45%, Δ = +40%. This is the most dramatic update in the ensemble. o3, starting from its own conservative 5% outside view, independently rediscovered the structural calendar argument and applied a full +45pp upward revision. The reasoning is explicit and principled: "+45 pp because the 'second-Thursday' algorithm (observed 8 of last 9 occasions) happens this year to fall on 9 Apr." This is the strongest evidence of the structural insight being independently derived.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** 2/4 — Brief: "~15 pp reduction" if halved, "slightly higher uncertainty only" if doubled. Less analytical than other instances.
- **Calibration Checklist:** 4/4 — All 6 elements present; blind spot about Cannes "first wave teaser" is a genuine consideration.

**Binary-specific:** The +40pp jump from 5% to 45% is large but principled — o3 explicitly attributed it to the "second-Thursday" mechanism. The key check: is the structural reasoning sound? Yes — April 9 is demonstrably the second Thursday of April 2026, and the pattern held 8/9 recent non-pandemic years. The 45% reflects ~20% probability the pattern slips to third Thursday, plus small probability of other delays. This is well-calibrated.

**Score:** 13/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 4% | 4% | 0 | 15/16 | Yes (no new evidence → no change) |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 9% | 9% | 0 | 15/16 | Yes (same reasoning) |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 3.5% | 4% | +0.5% | 15/16 | Yes (correctly anchors to conservative outside view) |
| S2-4 | o3 | 41.8% | 66% | +24.2% | 13/16 | Partial (structural reasoning valid; contaminated starting point) |
| S2-5 | o3 | 5% | 45% | +40% | 13/16 | Yes (structural argument correctly and independently derived) |

**Step 2 Total: 71/80**

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**S2-2 (Sonnet 4.6 ← o3 9%):** Effective. Sonnet 4.6 correctly recognized that the received o3 outside view was analytically superior (Laplace correction, Thursday alignment, conditional probability tree) and maintained it without unnecessary adjustment. This is the ideal cross-pollination behavior: the receiving model deferred to the better-reasoned input.

**S2-3 (GPT-5.2 ← Sonnet 4.6 3.5%):** Highly effective at correcting GPT-5.2's natural prior. GPT-5.2 had produced 41.8% in its own outside view (S1-3) but correctly anchored at 3.5% → 4% when receiving the conservative Sonnet 4.6 outside view. This demonstrates that cross-pollination can serve as a genuine error-correction mechanism — but it also reveals that GPT-5.2's estimates are highly sensitive to anchoring. A model that gives 41.8% from its own base view and 4% after receiving another's is exhibiting very high variance in its calibration.

**S2-4 (o3 ← GPT-5.2 41.8%):** Counterproductive. o3 received GPT-5.2's inflated 41.8% and further elevated it to 66%. While o3's structural reasoning (second Thursday, 33-day rule) is correct and would justify a substantial upward revision from a properly calibrated 5-9% baseline, starting from 41.8% produced a final estimate of 66% — about 20pp higher than S2-5 (which reached 45% from the same structural argument but a correct 5% baseline). The cross-pollination propagated and amplified the GPT-5.2 error rather than correcting it.

**Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):** Both behaved appropriately. S2-1 maintained 4% with no new evidence (correct). S2-5 made a large but principled +40pp update to 45% based on the structural calendar discovery (correct). The self-pollinated o3 instance (S2-5) demonstrated that when o3 develops its own structural insight without contamination, it arrives at 45% rather than 66% — suggesting 45% is the more calibrated o3 estimate for this question.

**Overall:** Cross-pollination increased diversity (final S2 spread: 4%–66%) but in a mixed way. The Sonnet 4.6 cross-model instances both performed well (S2-2 maintained a good prior, S2-3 corrected GPT-5.2), but the o3 cross-model instance (S2-4) amplified the ensemble's most significant error. The net effect of cross-pollination was that GPT-5.2's S1 error affected not just GPT-5.2 but also one o3 instance, shifting the ensemble mean upward from where it would have been otherwise.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All five instances correctly understood that the question resolves Yes only if the official Cannes website press release is dated **before** April 10 — correctly noting that April 10 itself would not satisfy the criteria (a subtlety several instances made explicit). S2-3 (GPT-5.2) confirmed "Yes only if official Cannes site posts an 'Official Selection' announcement dated **before Apr 10, 2026** (not teasers; first wave counts)" — accurate and precise.

The May 12–23 festival dates were correctly identified from the recruitment article in AskNews, corroborating the historical timing context.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. In all 12 modern-era years (2014–2025, excluding COVID), the Official Selection was announced on or after April 10 — never strictly before it.
2. The 2025 announcement was April 10 (the earliest on record); the 2024 announcement was April 11.
3. The Cannes Film Festival 2026 runs May 12–23.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | Logical error | Treats "announcement dates are near the April 10 threshold" as evidence that the probability is near 50% — conflating resolution question design with event probability. | Critical: inflated S1-3 by ~35pp |
| S1-1 (Sonnet 4.6) | Minor ambiguity | Notes "some dates (2015–2019, 2022–2023) are approximated rather than precisely confirmed" without engaging with the day-of-week implications | Low: didn't affect final estimate |
| S2-1 (Sonnet 4.6) | Possible error | States "Raoul Peck documentary article states a documentary will 'premiere on February 25, 2026, at the Cannes Film Festival' — this appears to be an error" — correct identification of an anomaly | Low: correctly flagged and dismissed |

### Hallucinations

No fabricated facts, dates, or sources were detected. All cited sources (Screen Daily, Deadline, Le Monde, Agent report dates) were consistent across instances and corroborated by multiple outputs. The Agent report dates (2014–2025) were used consistently without contradiction.

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review

### Divergence & Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Divergence metric | std_dev |
| Divergence value | 28.36 |
| Trigger threshold | 15.0 |
| Supervisor triggered? | Yes |
| Supervisor model | Claude Opus 4.6 |
| Supervisor confidence | MEDIUM |
| Supervisor cost | $0.60 |

### Stage 1: Disagreement Analysis

**Quality of disagreement identification:** Excellent. The supervisor correctly identified the three core disagreements:
1. Whether the "second Thursday of April" pattern predicts April 9, 2026 (the largest driver)
2. What base rate methodology is appropriate (raw 0% vs. structural 40%+)
3. Whether the 33-day lead time from festival opening is a reliable predictor

These three disagreements account for essentially all of the 62pp ensemble spread. The supervisor accurately attributed which forecasters held which positions: "Forecasters 4 (66%) and 5 (45%) argue structural Thursday pattern... Forecasters 1, 2, and 3 focus on raw historical record."

**Root cause classification:** Good. The supervisor correctly distinguished verifiable factual disagreements (exact dates, day-of-week pattern) from judgment-based disagreements (how much weight to give the structural pattern vs. raw base rate). However, it could have noted that S1-3's 41.8% was not actually based on the Thursday argument — GPT-5.2 derived its inflated estimate from a different (flawed) reasoning path entirely. The supervisor grouped all three "conservative" forecasters together without recognizing that forecasters 1, 2, and 3 had three different bases for their low estimates (conservative base rate, conservative base rate, and flawed threshold reasoning respectively).

### Stage 1: Search Query Quality

| # | Query | Source | Targets Which Disagreement? | Redundant with Round 1 Research? |
|---|-------|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | Cannes 2024 2025 official selection announcement exact date | Google | Disagreement 3 (33-day lead time) | Partial — round 1 had dates but not verified day-of-week |
| 2 | Cannes film festival 2026 press conference date | Google News | All three (any pre-announcement) | No — round 1 found nothing, this tries Google News |
| 3 | Agent: Give year-by-year dates from 2017–2025 with day-of-week, exact date, days before festival opening | Agent | Disagreements 1 and 3 directly | No — round 1 Agent asked for dates but not day-of-week |
| 4 | Cannes 2026 festival dates May official selection April | Google News | All three (calendar alignment) | Partial — May 12-23 was known, but query may surface new timing info |

**Assessment:** The queries are well-targeted. The Agent query (query 3) is particularly excellent — it explicitly asks for day-of-week and lead time information that would directly verify the "second Thursday" and "33-day rule" claims. This is a case where the supervisor correctly identified that the round 1 research had the raw dates but not the structural analysis, and designed a query to fill that gap. No queries were wasted on judgment-based disputes, which is appropriate.

### Stage 2: Supervisor Research Quality

**Novelty vs. redundancy:** Moderately novel. The supervisor's Agent report confirmed:
- The announcement has fallen on a Thursday in every confirmed year (2019, 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025)
- The "second Thursday" pattern holds for 2022, 2024, and 2025 consecutively
- The 2021 lead time was 33 days (June 3 → July 6); 2022 ~33 days; 2024 33 days (April 11 → May 14); 2025 33 days (April 10 → May 13)
- The 2019 exception: third Thursday (April 18); only 26-day lead time (not 33)

The Thursday/lead-time data was new relative to the round 1 Agent report, which had the dates but no day-of-week analysis. The Easter 2026 concern (April 5–6 holiday, France Easter Monday) was a genuinely new consideration introduced by the supervisor's analysis.

**Relevance:** The new research was directly relevant to the identified disagreements. No irrelevant tangents.

### Stage 2: Supervisor Reasoning & Reconciliation

**Reasoning quality:** Good. The supervisor explicitly addressed all three disagreements:
1. "The research strongly supports forecasters 4 and 5" on the April 9 second-Thursday prediction
2. "The raw '0/10 years before April 10' base rate... is factually correct but misleading" because the second Thursday had never previously fallen before April 10 — an important structural insight
3. Introduced the Easter 2026 concern as a new factor: "April 9 falls on the Thursday after Easter Sunday... In France, Easter Monday is a public holiday, and many people take the full week off. This could plausibly push the press conference to April 16."

The Easter factor was properly calibrated ("Cannes hasn't consistently avoided Easter-adjacent dates") — the supervisor looked at historical Easter proximity rather than just asserting Easter would cause a delay.

**Reconciliation approach:** Appropriate. The supervisor sided with the better-supported forecasters (4 and 5) on the factual questions, but maintained MEDIUM confidence due to genuine residual uncertainty (Easter week, 2019 exception, razor-thin margin). Final 50% is a significant upward revision from the 25.6% ensemble average, representing a thoughtful reconciliation rather than simple averaging.

The transition from 25.6% to 50% is a 24.4pp upward move. This is large but justifiable: the supervisor correctly determined that three of the five forecasters (1, 2, 3) had essentially missed the structural calendar argument entirely, and the structural argument is genuinely strong (two independent methods converging on April 9). However, the supervisor could have been more explicit about why 50% rather than, say, 45% (which S2-5 produced from first principles without contamination).

**Binary-specific:** Supervisor moved from 25.6% ensemble to 50% — nearly doubled. The direction was correct (the structural argument justifies a significant upward revision from the overly conservative ensemble). The magnitude is defensible: with two methods pointing to April 9 and three years of consecutive pattern, 50% reflects genuine uncertainty about whether the pattern holds in 2026 (Easter, 2019 exception, possible ad-hoc delay).

### Supervisor Scoring Rubric

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Disagreement Identification** | 4/4 | All three disagreements correctly identified, sides accurately characterized |
| **Query Generation** | 4/4 | Tightly targeted; Agent query for day-of-week data is excellent; Google News for 2026 pre-announcement is correct |
| **Research Novelty** | 3/4 | Confirmed Thursday pattern and 33-day rule (genuinely new analysis not in round 1); Easter concern is novel; somewhat redundant with what o3 had already computed informally |
| **Reasoning & Reconciliation** | 3/4 | Correctly sides with structural argument; Easter consideration is appropriate; 50% with MEDIUM confidence is well-calibrated; magnitude of upward revision (25.6% → 50%) could be more explicitly justified |

**Supervisor Score: 14/16**

### Supervisor Impact Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ensemble weighted average (pre-supervisor) | 25.6% |
| Supervisor prediction (post-supervisor) | 50.0% |
| Adjustment magnitude | +24.4pp (↑ 95%) |
| Was the adjustment an improvement? | Likely yes — the structural argument (second Thursday = April 9 = 33 days before May 12) is genuinely important and was missed by 3 of 5 forecasters; the supervisor correctly elevated the probability, though resolution will confirm |

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **o3 instances discovered the key structural insight independently.** Both S1-4 (outside view, 9%) and S2-5 (inside view, 45%) identified that April 9, 2026 is the second Thursday of April and approximately 33 days before the May 12 festival opening — the most analytically important observation for this question. This structural reasoning is what ultimately drove the supervisor's 50% estimate.
2. **Supervisor correctly identified and resolved the ensemble disagreement.** The supervisor's Agent query was perfectly designed to verify the day-of-week/lead-time claims, the research confirmed them, and the reasoning appropriately elevated the probability while maintaining MEDIUM confidence for genuine residual uncertainties.
3. **Historical research pipeline was highly effective.** The Agent query for year-by-year Cannes announcement dates was the single most valuable piece of research in the pipeline — it provided the comprehensive data foundation that all forecasters used for their base rates.

### Weaknesses
1. **GPT-5.2 committed a fundamental calibration error** by treating "proximity to resolution threshold" as "proximity to 50% probability." The 41.8% estimate from a 0/12 base rate, justified solely by the observation that the process is "near the cutoff," reflects a confusion between the question design and the event probability. This is the most significant individual error in the run.
2. **Cross-pollination amplified the GPT-5.2 error.** S2-4 (o3 receiving S1-3) should have been a case where o3's strong analytical capabilities corrected GPT-5.2's inflated estimate. Instead, o3 further elevated it to 66%. While o3's structural reasoning is correct, the contaminated starting point produced an overestimate even with good reasoning.
3. **Current research stage added no signal.** AskNews returned entirely irrelevant results for a question about the timing of a film festival selection announcement. There is no evidence the AskNews queries were designed or configured to find film industry trade press (Variety, Deadline, Screen Daily) — the most likely sources for any pre-announcement of the 2026 press conference date.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

The pipeline produced a defensible final answer (50%) through partially flawed mechanics. The structural calendar insight was discovered and validated; the supervisor correctly resolved the ensemble disagreement; the historical research was excellent. However, GPT-5.2's fundamental calibration error and its propagation through cross-pollination represent a significant quality gap that the supervisor had to compensate for rather than the pipeline preventing.

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements
- **Add a day-of-week query to historical research** for questions where the day of the week pattern might be important. For recurring annual events (festivals, elections, central bank meetings), asking "what day of the week did X occur each year?" could surface structural patterns before the forecasting stage rather than requiring forecasters to derive them independently.
- **Improve AskNews query targeting for cultural/entertainment questions.** AskNews appears to return irrelevant results for this question type. Consider using Google News instead for film industry questions, or configuring AskNews searches with domain restrictions to trade publications (variety.com, deadline.com, screendaily.com).
- **Consider a dedicated "calendar analysis" tool or prompt** that explicitly computes: (a) the second/third Thursday of each month, (b) lead times from event dates to resolution, (c) alignment with public holidays. For questions near calendar thresholds, this structural calculation is often more informative than historical base rates.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements
- **GPT-5.2 shows a systematic anchoring vulnerability.** GPT-5.2 produced 41.8% from its own outside view but 4% from a received conservative outside view — a 37pp swing based purely on the anchor. Consider either (a) giving GPT-5.2 a stricter base rate calculation prompt that requires explicit Laplace or other corrections before allowing upward adjustments, or (b) using GPT-5.2 in roles less dependent on independent base rate derivation.
- **Cross-pollination could be made more resistant to bad inputs.** When a receiving model's structural reasoning is strong (o3 in S2-4), it should be weighted more than the received outside view estimate. Consider adding a prompt instruction: "If your own structural analysis leads you to a substantially different probability than the received outside view, you should trust your own structural analysis and explicitly explain the discrepancy rather than treating the received estimate as an anchor."

### Model-Specific Feedback
- **Sonnet 4.6 (S1-1, S1-2, S2-1, S2-2):** Consistent, well-calibrated, good source analysis. Weakness: Sonnet 4.6 instances did not discover the structural Thursday/lead-time pattern in either the outside or inside view. Adding a structural calendar analysis prompt might help unlock this.
- **GPT-5.2 (S1-3, S2-3):** High variance — shows excellent calibration when anchored to a good outside view (S2-3: 4% is well-reasoned) but exhibits a "near-threshold → coin-flip" reasoning failure when deriving estimates independently (S1-3: 41.8%). This is a systematic prompt-engineering issue rather than a fundamental model limitation.
- **o3 (S1-4, S1-5, S2-4, S2-5):** The standout performer for structural analysis. Both outside view instances applied Laplace corrections and conditional probability trees. Both inside view instances independently discovered the second-Thursday/33-day calendar argument. S2-5 at 45% (uncontaminated) is likely closer to the "correct" probability than S2-4 at 66% (contaminated by GPT-5.2's S1-3). The supervisor's 50% split between these two is reasonable.

## Post-Resolution Analysis (Complete After Resolution)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Actual Outcome | TBD (resolves 2026-04-10) |
| Final Prediction | 50.0% |
| Brier Score (binary) | TBD |

### Retrospective
- TBD after resolution. Key question: did Cannes announce on April 9, 2026 (Yes) or on/after April 10 (No)?
- The structural argument (second Thursday = April 9, 33-day rule converging on same date) was strong; the main uncertainty was the Easter week timing (April 5–6 holiday) and the ~20% historical rate of slipping to the third Thursday.
- If Yes: o3's structural analysis and the supervisor's reconciliation were well-calibrated. The 50% estimate appropriately reflected meaningful probability of this outcome.
- If No: The Easter week effect or a third-Thursday slip occurred. The 50% estimate was well-positioned for this outcome as well.
