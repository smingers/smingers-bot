## Critical Issues Summary

**Complete this section FIRST after reading all artifacts. List the most significant problems that affected forecast quality.**

**Note:** Methodological diversity and forecast spread are NOT inherently issues. Only flag instances where reasoning is flawed, evidence is misinterpreted, or analytical tools are misapplied to the specific question.

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| AskNews deep research hit usage limit (403) during current search | Med | Research | "Error running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)'" in search_current.json. Inside-view research had only standard article summaries, not the extra deep-research layer. |
| Single-candidate concentration underweighted by high forecasters | Low | S2-1, S2-2, S2-3 | S2-1/S2-2/S2-3 (73%, 62%, 72%) stayed well above 60% despite the question hinging on one film (Super Mario Galaxy, Apr 3). o3 instances (S2-4, S2-5) explicitly modeled concentration risk and landed at 45%. |

**Severity definitions:**
- **Critical**: Fundamentally compromises the forecast (e.g., misunderstood resolution criteria, hallucinated key facts, calculation errors that propagate)
- **High**: Significantly affects forecast quality (e.g., missed critical recent information, wrong update direction, major logical flaw)
- **Medium**: Notable weakness but core forecast intact (e.g., incomplete source analysis, suboptimal reference class, over/under-weighted evidence)
- **Low**: Minor issue (e.g., formatting, slight imprecision, redundant analysis)

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes (implied by query labels) |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (current; deep research failed) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (BOM, Screen Rant, etc.) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (from `query_historical.md`):
1. "2026 film release schedule" (Google)
2. "2026 blockbuster billion box office" (Google News)
3. "Provide list of major movies releasing worldwide Jan to Apr 2026 and any industry forecasts or analyst commentary on their expected global box office, especially likelihood of surpassing $1 billion." (Agent)

**Current Queries** (from `query_current.md`):
1. "2026 blockbuster movie release schedule" (Google)
2. "early 2026 film billion box office" (Google News)
3. "Which films launching Jan-Apr 2026 are projected by analysts to top one billion dollars worldwide?" (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Full Jan–Apr 2026 slate; base-rate and precedent | Recent news, tracking, analyst updates |
| Content type | Release calendars, analyst lists, Agent synthesis | News articles, trade reports, China/Spring Festival |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent, question URLs | Google, Google News, AskNews (deep research failed) |
| Unique contribution | Agent report with IndieWire/UpcomingOnScreen-style “near lock” for Mario; BOM 2026 YTD snapshot | AskNews set (China box office, Koimoi, CNBC franchise piece); no deep-research layer |

**Analysis:**
- Query sets are partially overlapping (release schedule, “billion” framing) but historical emphasized base rates and Agent synthesis; current emphasized recent news and analyst/trade sentiment. Appropriate split.
- Historical queries successfully established the 2026 slate, BOM 2026 YTD (no film near $1B), and Super Mario Galaxy (Apr 3) as the dominant pre–May 1 candidate. Agent report summarized multiple analyst takes (e.g., “near lock,” $1.5B forecast).
- Current queries surfaced CNBC franchise-underperformance piece, Hollywood Reporter weekend numbers, Koimoi on Michael (Apr 24), Chinese Spring Festival totals, and ScreenRant/Comicbook listicles. AskNews usage-limit error prevented the “deep research” step from running.
- Critical information: BOM 2026 snapshot and resolution nuance (2026-earned gross) came from question-URL scraping and historical pack; current round added franchise-risk and China/market context. No major tool mischoices; Agent was used only for historical, which fits design.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research remains largely factual: BOM totals, release dates, analyst quotes, and trade projections. The Agent report does state a conclusion (“The probability is high… The question resolves **Yes** with high probability”) and thus blurs into forecasting; forecasters appropriately treated it as synthesized evidence rather than adopting its probability. No other outputs inappropriately assign probabilities.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** BOM 2026 YTD (top film ~$152M); Super Mario Galaxy Movie Apr 3 release; original 2023 film crossed $1B in ~21–26 days; Variety/IndieWire-style “sure thing”/“near lock” for sequel; Avatar/Zootopia as 2025 releases (correctly not counted for 2026); CNBC franchise underperformance; China Spring Festival totals (no single film near $1B); Michael Apr 24 (too few days before May 1).
- **Critical information missed:** None identified. AskNews deep research could have added another layer but was capped by usage limit.
- **Source quality by tool:** Question-URL scraping (BOM, Screen Rant, etc.) and Agent synthesis were high value. Google/News and AskNews surfaced useful trade and news; Koimoi/Comicbook are lower-tier but used appropriately as sentiment/trailer data.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Explicitly evaluates 9 sources (BOM, Screen Rant, RT, IMDb, THR, NBC, Screen Rant projections, Variety, Agent). Correctly flags NBC/Avatar/Zootopia as 2025 releases not counting toward 2026 BOM page; distinguishes opinion (Screen Rant writer) from trade (Variety) and synthesis (Agent).
- **Reference Class Selection:** Offers three classes (films crossing $1B by May 1; sequels to $1B+ animated films; analyst-consensus blockbusters) and selects the narrow, favorable class: sequels to $1B+ animated films releasing in April with ~4 weeks to deadline.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** States window Feb 24–May 1 (~66 days); Mario Apr 3 → ~28 days; original crossed $1B in ~3 weeks; notes 3–5 weeks typical for eventual $1B hits.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Builds from P(Mario crosses $1B before May 1) ≈ 70–80% via conditional (P($1B+ hit) × P(within 28 days | $1B+)); adds small P(other film). States ~72–78% then sets 78%.

**Question-type-specific:** Binary probability 78%; considers both Yes (Mario hits in time) and No (underperformance, delay, or no other film).

- **Score:** 15/16 (strong source and reference-class work; base rate is clearly derived; minor rounding to 78% without explicit sensitivity).

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Covers same 9 sources; explicitly clarifies Avatar/Zootopia on 2025 BOM page; distinguishes Screen Rant opinion from Variety/IndieWire and Agent synthesis.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three classes (any year $1B by May 1; animated sequels to $1B films; April release with ~4 weeks to cutoff). Chooses #3 as “near-perfect analog.”
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Window ~65 days; Mario Apr 3 → ~28 days; original ~21 days to $1B; no other Jan–Mar candidate.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** “60–70%” for sequel to $1B+ animated film; adds uncertainty (15–20% underperform, ~5% delay, ~5% residual) → 75–80%, sets 77%.

**Question-type-specific:** Binary 77%; Yes/No pathways clear.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Each source tagged (BOM factual but backward-looking, Screen Rant opinion, RT/IMDb/THR factual dates, NBC caveated for resolution window, Gower Street moderate, Variety “strongest expert-media,” Agent suggestive). Net: only plausible pre–May 1 path is April breakout → Mario.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three classes; chooses “sequels/follow-ups to $1B family/animation hits, ~4 weeks before cutoff.” Notes uncertainty on sequel conversion and “speed to $1B” (leggy family films).
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Now 2026-02-24, deadline 2026-05-01; Mario ~Apr 1–3 → 28–30 days; $1B within ~30 days “common for event films” but “less guaranteed for animated/family.”
- **Base Rate Derivation:** “Modestly better than coin flip”; anchor below 50% for “no film by May 1” in many years; adjustment for Mario analog pulls up; “upset” rate (sequel underperform, speed, BOM lag) keeps it “a bit above 50%.” **52.4%.**

**Question-type-specific:** Binary 52.4%; explicitly restrains from “near-certain” and stresses timing/speed risk.

- **Score:** 14/16 (strong discipline; base rate a bit light on explicit numeric derivation).

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Nine sources with quality labels (BOM “purely factual,” NBC “irrelevant for resolution,” Screen Rant “low–medium,” Agent “treat with caution”). Factual takeaways: no 2026 film >$152M; only mega-franchise pre–May 1 is Mario (3 Apr); billion-dollar performance still achievable (Avatar/Zootopia as context).
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three classes with counts: (1) years with any film $1B by May 1 → 4/17 ≈ 24%; (2) years with pre-May ultra-high-profile franchise release → 4/7 hit by May 1 (57%); (3) Jan–Apr wide releases $100M+ domestic → 6/22 ~27%. Chooses #2, “major franchise film in window.”
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 67 days to resolution; historical $1B-by–May-1 films did so in ≤24 days of release; early-April opener has time, late-April effectively none.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 57% +5 (pandemic fade) −10 (single candidate) −10 (idiosyncratic flop risk) ≈ 42%. Cross-check with “upset” rate among 7 early-window mega-releases (3 failed) → 43% upset, consistent with 42%.

**Question-type-specific:** Binary 42%; base rate driven by reference class, not journalistic optimism.

- **Score:** 16/16 (explicit counts, adjustments, and cross-check).

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Eight sources with reliability and relevance (BOM high quality; NBC high reliability, low relevance; Screen Rant moderate facts, low forecasts; Agent “unverified”). Chooses broadest base-rate class and minimizes cherry-picking.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Class 1: years 2010–2025, incidence of Jan–Apr release reaching $1B by May 1. Lists 2015 (Furious 7), 2017 (Beauty and the Beast), 2019 (Captain Marvel, Endgame), 2023 (Mario) → 4/16 ≈ 25%.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 67 days; successful films 17–26 days after release (or 5 for Endgame); film opening by ~10 Apr can in principle still pass $1B by May 1.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 25% +5 pp (structural: faster international rollouts, IP clustering) = 30%. Cross-check: no result below 10% or above 40% justified; “one-in-three” without film-specific info.

**Question-type-specific:** Binary 30%; deliberately outside-view, no film-specific boost.

- **Score:** 15/16 (clear, conservative; slight room for more explicit “why not lower/higher”).

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 78% | 15/16 | Source nuance (BOM 2026 vs 2025), conditional decomposition | Rounding to 78% without sensitivity |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 77% | 15/16 | Same; “near-perfect analog” reference class | Similar |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 52.4% | 14/16 | Discipline, speed-to-$1B and BOM lag risks | Base rate less numerically explicit |
| S1-4 | o3 | 42% | 16/16 | Explicit reference-class counts, adjustments, upset cross-check | None notable |
| S1-5 | o3 | 30% | 15/16 | Broad base rate (25%), minimal adjustment | Very conservative |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete | Superficial | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self-model) | 78% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 42% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | 77% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 52.4% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 30% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong/Moderate/Weak applied; Strong: Mario Apr 3 + original 21-day $1B, multiple $1B+ forecasts; Moderate: CNBC franchise underperformance, 28-day window; Weak: 2026 year hype, franchise fatigue.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 78% → Output 73%, Δ = −5 pp. Justified by explicit conditionals (release on time, $1B+ hit, within 28 days) and franchise-underperformance trend; 73% “slightly below” outside view.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved (to ~Mar 15) → ~5–10%; doubled (to ~Jul 1) → ~95%+.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Resolution criteria, base rate, consistency, key evidence, blind spot (Mario underperform 40–50%), status quo all present.

**Question-type-specific:** Update direction (slight down) matches evidence (CNBC, conditionals); 73% internally consistent.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: Mario Apr 3, 2023 crossed $1B in ~26 days, Gower Street 2026; Moderate: Michael Apr 24 (7 days), no other pre-May candidate; Weak: China strength, Koimoi.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 42% (o3) → Output 62%, Δ = +20 pp. Justified by “strong direct precedent” of 2023 Mario and “adequate time window,” with “single-candidate” and sequel-risk acknowledged; 62% “meaningful upward shift” from outside view.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved → ~2–3%; doubled → ~85–90%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Resolution, base rate, consistency, evidence, blind spot (delay, China, flop), status quo.

**Question-type-specific:** Large upward move from received 42% is justified by inside-view precedent; 62% plausible.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: Mario 2023 $1B in ~3 weeks; schedule (only Mario pre–May 1). Moderate: CNBC macro/franchise fatigue; Gower Street sentiment. Weak: China, Koimoi/Michael.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 77% → Output 72%, Δ = −5 pp. Justified by “tighter-than-it-looks” cutoff/BOM lag, sequel pace risk, lack of competition; “still well above 50%” due to analog and landscape.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved → near 0–5%; doubled → >85–90%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Paraphrase, base rate, consistency, top evidence, blind spot, status quo.

**Question-type-specific:** Slight down from 77% consistent with evidence; 72% coherent.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: Mario 2023 day-26 $1B; BOM shows no 2026 title close. Moderate: Trailer engagement, Gower Street; Weak: Koimoi, other March titles.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 52.4% → Output 45%, Δ = −7.4 pp. Adjustments: single path −6, predecessor speed +5, sequel drop-off −4, buzz +3, Michael/China +2; net −7 from base. Then film-specific Fermi (0.95×0.65×0.80 + other) ≈ 50% vs rough 28%; weighted 70% film / 30% base → 43%, round 45%.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved → ~5%; doubled → “Yes” very likely.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Paraphrase, base, consistency, evidence (≤20 wds), blind spot, status quo.

**Question-type-specific:** Down from 52.4% to 45% reflects concentration and sequel risk; 45% defensible.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: only SMG (3 Apr) has ≥26 days; Mario 2023 hit $1B in 26 days, Endgame 5, F7 17. Moderate: trailer metrics, Gower Street. Weak: Koimoi Michael, Chinese blockbuster.
- **Update from Base Rate:** Input 30% → Output 45%, Δ = +15 pp. Slate scarcity −10, SMG precedent +15, volatility/date slippage −5, China −2 → 28%; film-specific 0.95×0.65×0.80 + 1% ≈ 50%; 0.7×50% + 0.3×28% ≈ 43% → 45%.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved → ~5%; doubled → >90%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Criteria, base, consistency, evidence, blind spot (delay/boycott, <$200M open), status quo.

**Question-type-specific:** Up from 30% to 45% reflects film-specific path; 45% consistent.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 78% | 73% | −5 | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 42% | 62% | +20 | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 77% | 72% | −5 | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 52.4% | 45% | −7.4 | 15/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 30% | 45% | +15 | 15/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.6, receives S1-4 at 42%):** Engaged substantively with the low o3 base rate, then raised to 62% using inside-view precedent (2023 Mario, 28 days). Did not simply revert to Sonnet’s typical 75%+; the +20 pp is explicitly justified.
- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2, receives S1-2 at 77%):** Slightly lowered 77% → 72% on cutoff/BOM lag and sequel pace; stayed in the same ballpark as the received view while adding caution.
- **S2-4 (o3, receives S1-3 at 52.4%):** Moved down to 45% using concentration risk and film-specific Fermi; meaningfully incorporated the received 52.4% into a more conservative combined view.
- **S2-1 and S2-5:** Same-model (S1-1 and S1-5); S2-1 stayed high (73%), S2-5 moved up from 30% to 45%. Diversity in final outputs (73, 62, 72, 45, 45) is partly due to cross-pollination: S2-2 and S2-4 pulled toward middle/low from different starting points.
- **Conclusion:** Cross-pollination was effective. Cross-model instances did not ignore their inputs; they updated in direction and magnitude consistent with evidence. Spread (28 pp) reflects genuine disagreement on reference class and single-candidate risk, not failure to engage.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances treated resolution as: at least one film on Box Office Mojo’s **2026** worldwide page with ≥$1B **earned in 2026** before May 1, 2026. Avatar: Fire and Ash and Zootopia 2 (2025 releases) were consistently excluded from counting toward Yes.
- Timeframe (Feb 24 – May 1, 2026; Mario Apr 3 → ~28 days) was stated correctly.
- Current state (no 2026 film near $1B as of snapshot; Mario as primary candidate) was accurate.

### Factual Consensus

1. BOM 2026 YTD leader ~$152M; no 2026 film at $1B yet.
2. Super Mario Galaxy Movie scheduled Apr 3 (or Apr 1/3); original 2023 crossed $1B in ~21–26 days.
3. Resolution depends on 2026-earned gross on BOM 2026 page; 2025 releases do not count.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| — | None identified | — | — |

### Hallucinations

None identified. Release dates, BOM figures, and analyst attributions (Variety, Gower Street, IndieWire-style “near lock”) match or sensibly summarize the research pack.

---

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review (Optional)

### Divergence & Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Divergence metric | *(not recorded in artifacts)* |
| Ensemble spread (max − min) | 28 pp (73% − 45%) |
| Binary trigger threshold (config) | 15 |
| Supervisor triggered? | No |
| Supervisor artifacts | None (no supervisor_*.md / supervisor_result.json) |

Supervisor was not triggered. With binary threshold at 15 and a 28 pp spread, the divergence metric used by the pipeline may differ from raw spread (e.g., standard deviation ≈ 12.4 pp). No supervisor section is completed; no cost or confidence to report.

---

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Resolution criteria:** Correct handling of “2026 worldwide” and exclusion of 2025 releases (Avatar/Zootopia) across all forecasters.
2. **Research use:** BOM snapshot, Agent synthesis, and current news (CNBC, Koimoi, China, trade) were used to identify the single main candidate (Mario Apr 3) and risks (franchise fatigue, concentration).
3. **Reference-class diversity:** Useful spread between broad base-rate (S1-5: 25% → 30%), conditional franchise-window (S1-4: 42%), and film-specific analog (S1-1/S1-2: 77–78%, S1-3: 52.4%).
4. **Cross-pollination:** S2-2 and S2-4 meaningfully updated from received outside views; updates were justified and evidence-based.
5. **Calibration checklists:** All five inside-view outputs completed paraphrase, base rate, consistency, evidence, blind spot, and status quo.

### Weaknesses

1. **AskNews limit:** Current round lost the deep-research component (403), reducing optionality for additional checks.
2. **Wide spread:** 28 pp (73% to 45%) may complicate interpretation; the split is driven by reference-class and single-candidate risk rather than by resolution misunderstanding.
3. **Template model names:** Template uses “Sonnet 4.5”; config and metadata use Claude Sonnet 4.6. Assessment uses 4.6 for consistency with artifacts.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

Strong research and resolution handling; clear reasoning and cross-pollination. One medium issue (AskNews deep research unavailable) and wide but justified spread. No critical or high-severity issues.

---

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

- Monitor AskNews usage/limits to avoid silent loss of deep-research layer; consider fallback or graceful degradation messaging when limit is hit.
- Optional: add one explicit “resolution criteria” check query (e.g., “Box Office Mojo 2026 worldwide page what counts as 2026 earnings”) if similar year-bound questions recur.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

- None required for this run. Optional: surface divergence metric and threshold in metadata when supervisor is not triggered so assessors can verify.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- Sonnet 4.6 (S1-1, S1-2): Strong source and reference-class work; consider explicit sensitivity when rounding to a single percentage.
- GPT-5.2 (S1-3): Good outside-view discipline; slightly more explicit base-rate math would strengthen scoring.
- o3 (S1-4, S1-5): Strong reference-class rigor and cross-checks; S2-4/S2-5’s concentration-risk framing improved balance of the ensemble.
