## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent report includes probability estimate | Medium | Research / S1-All | The agentic search report ends with "the probability is moderate but not high — perhaps 25–40%," which is 4–7× the ensemble's final 6%. Most forecasters correctly discount this as an AI estimate, but it pollutes the research with forecasting output that should be factual-only. |
| Divergent base rate methodologies between model families | Medium | S1-1, S1-2 vs. S1-4, S1-5 | Sonnet 4.6 instances used a Poisson/uniform calculation yielding 12–13% outside-view probabilities; o3 instances used empirical window-count yielding 5–6%. The 7pp gap in starting priors is significant, though the empirical method is more appropriate for this non-uniform distribution. |
| Conflicting attribution of 2024 Magritte sale | Low | S1-4, S1-5 | Both o3 instances treat the Magritte as the sole pre-May $100M+ instance in their base rate, but they disagree: S1-4 says "Christie's London 28 Feb 2024"; S1-5 says "Sotheby's London 2 Mar 2024." The agent report only confirms it was Christie's in 2024 without a specific month. The exact date drives whether it counts as a pre-May observation, affecting the empirical base rate. |
| Sotheby's press page returned 404 | Low | Research | The primary resolution source `https://www.sothebys.com/en/press` returned HTTP 404. No Sotheby's press releases were directly scraped to verify absence of announcements. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes (both stages) |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes (both stages) |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (historical only) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (current only) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes — 3 of 4 URLs scraped (Sotheby's returned 404) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (Google, Google News, Agent):
1. `$100 million painting auction record` (Google)
2. `Christie's spring 2026 evening sale estimate` (Google News)
3. `List all ≥$80 m painting auction results at Christie's, Sotheby's, Phillips since 2010 and note any announced 2026 consignments expected above $100 m.` (Agent)

**Current Queries** (Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. `Christie's Sotheby's painting $100 million sale` (Google)
2. `upcoming $100m painting auction 2026` (Google News)
3. `List any Christie's, Sotheby's, or Phillips press releases since 2025 announcing a painting selling for 100 million dollars or more.` (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Long-run base rate (2010–2025) | Immediate calendar (Feb–Apr 2026) |
| Content type | Historical results list, consignment outlook | Upcoming sale calendars, press releases |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Empirical frequency data, $80M+ result table, 2026 consignment confirmation of absence | Confirmed no announced $100M+ lots, surfaced current market trend data |

**Analysis:**
- The query sets are well-differentiated: historical queries establish base rates; current queries surface absence-of-announcement evidence. There is minimal overlap.
- The Agent query was optimally designed — a compound research request covering both the historical list and 2026 consignment outlook, yielding the most informative single output in the run.
- The AskNews query correctly targeted current-period press releases rather than duplicating the historical search.
- The Google News current query `upcoming $100m painting auction 2026` returned several off-topic results (cryptocurrency auctions) and only 3 usable results, suggesting a suboptimal query for this stage.
- Critical gap: `https://www.sothebys.com/en/press` returned HTTP 404, preventing direct scraping of Sotheby's press releases — one of the three named resolution sources. Christie's press releases page and Phillips press page both returned structural/cookie-only content (not truly content-blocked, but near-useless). The resolution criteria primary sources were effectively inaccessible via scraping.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Yes — the Agent report concludes with: "The probability is moderate but not high — perhaps 25–40% — given the compressed timeframe and absence of announced qualifying lots." This is a probability estimate embedded in a research output. It is higher by 4–7× than the ensemble's eventual 6%, and its stated reasoning ("compressed timeframe and absence of announced qualifying lots") actually supports a *lower* probability than 25–40%, creating an internal inconsistency. All five forecasters correctly flagged this estimate as AI-generated and discounted it, but its presence in the research context is an issue for less critical readers.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** (1) No $100M+ painting consignments announced for the resolution window; (2) Christie's March 5, 2026 "Art of the Surreal" sale top lot ~£9.5M — well below threshold; (3) Sotheby's April/May sales feature Rothko at $10–15M as the top individual painting; (4) Historical frequency data showing ~1–2 nine-figure painting sales per year with strong May/November concentration; (5) November 2025 Klimt $236.4M sale as the most recent nine-figure event (pre-window); (6) Market structural decline (fine art down 35% from 2022 peak); (7) Shift toward private sales (Christie's +41%, Sotheby's +17% in 2024).
- **Critical information missed:** Exact date of the 2024 Magritte *L'empire des lumières* sale (the sole claimed pre-May $100M+ datapoint in the base rate calculation). The artprice.com article on $100M+ sales returned a content extraction failure; artnet.com and artsy.net returned 403 errors for some relevant articles.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: Good — Christie's press releases were accessible via site-specific extraction; Wikipedia and CultureType provided reliable historical facts
  - Agent report: High value for reference class data; compromised by including a probability estimate
  - AskNews articles: Very high volume (25 articles) with strong recency; CNN, Artsy, Artnet, New York Post confirmed Klimt sale; Wallpaper\* and NEWSIS confirmed upcoming Sotheby's sales
  - Question URL scraping: Largely ineffective for the auction house press pages themselves (returned cookie/structural content or 404)

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough. Evaluates each source individually, correctly labels Christie's/Phillips press pages as non-functional, calls the Verus Art blog "commercial source" with appropriate caution, and — crucially — explicitly flags the Agent report's 25–40% estimate as an "opinion from an AI agent, not an identifiable human expert." This is the clearest treatment of the contaminated agent output across all five instances. **4/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three candidate classes: (1) annual base rate ~77–85%; (2) specific pre-May window; (3) conditional on no announced consignment. Correctly selects class #2 (the pre-May window) as most appropriate and explains why. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 65-day window. Notes that major spring NY sales "typically occur in May, which falls AFTER the deadline." Identifies Christie's March 5 Surreal sale as the only announced sale in window. Good. **4/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses informal Poisson reasoning: "annual base rate of ~80% × (1-2 qualifying sale weeks before May 1 out of ~8 total) ≈ 12–16%." Mathematical structure is sound but relies on uniform distribution assumption being partially violated by seasonality. Arrives at 13%, acknowledging the estimate is rough. **3/4**

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Both YES and NO pathways considered explicitly
- 13% reflects strong structural reasoning about pre-May window rarity, absence of announcements
- Mild over-estimate vs. the empirical 6% base rate from o3 instances — the informal Poisson approach doesn't fully capture how strongly sales cluster in May/Nov

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Good but slightly less thorough than S1-1. Evaluates each source, correctly notes the Agent's 25–40% is a "rough reference rather than authoritative." Slightly less explicit on the promotional bias of Verus Art. **3/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three candidate classes, same as S1-1. Selects pre-May window as most appropriate with good justification. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly identifies 65-day window. Lists historical examples with dates, noting most major spring NY sales fall after May 1. Provides a specific list of historical $100M+ events by month/season. **4/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Uses Poisson: "1.25 events/year × 65 days → 20% if uniform." Then applies seasonality adjustment to 8–12%, then adjusts down for no announced lots. The 20% uniform calculation is presented but the final 12% relies on judgment ("seasonal clustering strongly away from this window"). Mathematical pathway is explicit but the seasonality discount magnitude is asserted rather than derived. **3/4**

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- YES/NO paths both addressed
- 12% is slightly higher than warranted given the empirical base rate from the o3 instances but within reasonable range

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Systematic and detailed. Evaluates all 10 sources individually with quality labels, dates, and fact/opinion distinctions. Correctly identifies the Agent report's estimate as "a working dataset for base rates, not ground truth." Treats all market commentary opinions as non-authoritative. **4/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identifies three candidate classes using the same framework as Sonnet instances but more formally: (1) random 2-month window; (2) late-winter/early-spring period; (3) annual rate with adjustment. Selects (3) with justification that it uses a larger sample while still requiring seasonality adjustment. Methodologically sound. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Explicitly applies a Poisson formula: `P(≥1) = 1 - e^(-0.18) ≈ 16%`. Correct math. Then applies seasonality penalty. Notes window ends "right before May's main New York auctions." **4/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Most mathematically explicit of all five outside-view instances. Derives ~16% from Poisson, explicitly acknowledges non-uniform distribution, then applies "half to two-thirds" seasonality discount to arrive at "high single digits to low teens," settling on 9.8%. The discount magnitude is judgmental but the overall procedure is clear. **3/4**

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Both pathways explicitly considered
- 9.8% represents a reasonable intermediate position between Sonnet (12–13%) and o3 (5–6%)

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Concise but accurate. Evaluates all seven key sources correctly, labels the Agent report as useful for "long-run frequency counts" but treats its judgment about "no such consignments exist" as requiring caution. **3/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses reference class 2 (Jan-April period) directly, explicitly rejecting the annual base rate as ignoring seasonality. Strongest methodological justification for the choice. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Derives empirical count: "15 nine-figure painting sales; 13 occurred in May or November evening sales, 1 in June (Sotheby's London 2023), 1 in late February (Christie's London 28 Feb 2024)." This is the most data-grounded timeframe analysis, using a direct count rather than inference. Notes that major sale weeks fall after May 1. **4/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Clear derivation: 1/16 Jan-April windows = 6%, then adjusted -2pp for no announcement, +1pp for fat-tail surprises = 5%. The empirical count is the correct approach for a non-uniformly distributed phenomenon. Minor issue: the sole pre-May data point (Feb 2024 Magritte) has conflicting attribution between S1-4 (Christie's) and S1-5 (Sotheby's), suggesting some uncertainty about whether this observation is correctly placed. **3/4**

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- Clear consideration of upside tail (surprise consignment, short-notice white-glove sale) prevents over-anchoring
- 5% is the most conservative of all outside-view estimates; well-justified by empirical count

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Solid, same structure as S1-4. Correctly identifies primary sources vs. secondary. Notes that the Agent report's judgment about consignment absence should be "treated cautiously but accept the listed historical data." **3/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Explicitly counts "32 Mar-Apr windows" across 16 years (treating each year as 2 windows) — a slightly different framing than S1-4's "16 Jan-April windows." Both are legitimate but the double-counting of windows (two per year) inflates the denominator, making the base rate 1/32 ≈ 3.1% vs. S1-4's 1/16 = 6%. This methodological choice is not explicitly justified. **3/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Lists scheduled March London sales, April Hong Kong, notes NY May sales are after deadline. Accurate and correctly sourced to the Christie's press release. **4/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 3.1% raw base rate (1/32), adjusted +1.5pp trend, +2pp late-announcement, -1pp soft market = 5.5% → 5.6%. The adjustments are sensible but the trend adjustment is weakly justified. **3/4**

**Question-type-specific assessment (binary):**
- The disagreement with S1-4 on auction house attribution (Sotheby's vs. Christie's for the 2024 Magritte) is a factual inconsistency, but doesn't materially affect the estimate since both instances use it as the sole pre-May data point
- 5.6% is very close to S1-4's 5% — the two o3 instances converge despite slightly different methodology

- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 13% | 15/16 | Explicitly flags agent probability contamination; excellent source critique | Informal Poisson slightly over-estimates by not fully capturing seasonal clustering |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 12% | 14/16 | Good reference class selection with historical examples | Seasonality discount magnitude asserted without derivation |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 9.8% | 15/16 | Most explicit mathematical framework; systematic source analysis | "Half to two-thirds" seasonality discount is still judgment-based |
| S1-4 | o3 | 5% | 14/16 | Empirical window count is the correct methodology for seasonal data | Slight uncertainty about the 2024 Magritte date/attribution |
| S1-5 | o3 | 5.6% | 13/16 | Same empirical approach; adds trend adjustment | "32 windows" framing inflates denominator without justification; attribution discrepancy with S1-4 |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self-model) | 13% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 5% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | 12% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 9.8% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 5.6% (but uses 3% raw base) |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses Strong/Moderate/Weak framework explicitly. Strong negative: no announced lots, timing mismatch. Moderate negative: market softening, private sales trend. Weak positive: Klimt demand capacity, possible unannounced special sale. Well-applied. **4/4**
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 13% → Output: 9%, Δ = -4pp). Justifies each downward adjustment quantitatively: -4pp for no announced lots, -1pp for market softening/private sales, +0pp residual. Direction correct, magnitude appropriate. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicitly addresses halving (~32 days → 5–7%) and doubling (~130 days → 25–35%, captures May NY sales). Well-analyzed. **4/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (13%). Consistency check: "9 out of 100 times." Key evidence listed (5 items). Blind spot identified (estate emergency consignment → 5–8% upside). Status quo stated. **4/4**

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction matches evidence direction (all key current evidence negative)
- 9% is internally consistent: "no announced qualifying lots" is the primary driver of the -4pp adjustment
- The private sales trend factor is correctly identified but may be somewhat over-weighted given it's a structural shift rather than immediately relevant to this specific 65-day window

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses Strong/Moderate/Weak framework. Strong negative: Klimt pre-window (Nov 2025) = no qualifying sale has occurred; no announced consignments; historical seasonality (1/16 windows). Moderate negative: market decline, risk-averse guarantees. Weak positive: November 2025 rebound shows capacity, possible unannounced sale. **4/4**
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 5% → Output: 3%, Δ = -2pp). Starts from S1-4's 5% base. Adjustments: -2pp no announced lots; -1pp market decline; -1pp recent Klimt sale (reducing probability of "another one so soon"); +0.5pp fat tail; +0.5pp November rebound; net -3pp → 2%, then recalibrates to 3% to avoid over-adjusting. The upward recalibration from 2% to 3% is appropriately conservative. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicit: halved (~32 days → 2–3%), doubled (~128 days to July → 15–20%, captures May NY sales). **4/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (5%). Consistency check: "3 out of 100." Key evidence (4 items, all factually valid). Blind spot (estate consignment → 10–15%). Status quo clear. **4/4**

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The cross-pollination effect is clearly visible: this Sonnet 4.6 instance, anchored to o3's 5%, produces 3% vs. the self-anchored S2-1's 9%
- The -1pp adjustment for "recent Klimt sale reduces probability of another so soon" is a novel argument not made by other instances — it's reasonable but weakly justified given that historic nine-figure sales don't appear to exhibit mean-reversion within a season

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses S/M/W framework explicitly. Strong negative: no announced lots, timing mismatch (dominant factors). Moderate negative: art market softening, private sales trend. Weak positive: stock market boom driving art demand, Klimt capacity. Correctly weights the evidence. **4/4**
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 12% → Output: 9%, Δ = -3pp). Starts from the 12% received from Sonnet S1-2. Adjustments: -4pp no announced lots; structural timing already embedded in outside view; -1pp market softening and private sales; +0pp residual. Net -5pp → 7%, then chooses 8–9% given some uncertainty. Sets final at 9%. The arithmetic is slightly inconsistent (12% - 5% = 7% but output is 9%), suggesting a floor effect from uncertainty rather than mechanical calculation. Direction is correct. **3/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Explicit: halved (~32 days → 5–7%), doubled (~130 days → 25–35%). Well-done. **4/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** Very comprehensive. Paraphrase accurate. Base rate stated (13% from own outside view — notably uses its own S1-3 outside view as the reference, not the received S1-2 = 12%). Consistency check included. 5 key evidence items. Blind spot (estate/emergency consignment). Status quo stated. **4/4**

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction correct
- The slight arithmetic inconsistency (should be ~7-8% but outputs 9%) is minor — likely reflects rounding up from uncertainty
- Notably, S2-3 states "Outside view base rate: 13%" in the checklist but it received S1-2's 12% outside view and its own S1-3 was 9.8%. This is a minor inconsistency in the checklist — it appears to be substituting S1-1's outside view (13%) as the "outside view" reference point.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Uses Strong/Moderate/Weak labels. Strong: seasonality and window excluding May marquee week; no announced $100M+ consignments. Moderate: market softness, no upcoming trophy chatter. Weak: Salvator Mundi-style surprise possible; November 2025 Klimt proves demand. **4/4**
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 9.8% → Output: 6%, Δ = -3.8pp). Applies a quantified seasonality discount: `9.8% × 0.25 = 2.5%`, then adds 2pp for surprise tail → 4.5%, rounded to 6%. The 0.25 seasonality factor (claiming only 25% of nine-figure events are in this window) is the sharpest discount applied in the ensemble. The factor is directionally correct but possibly too aggressive: if even 1 of 16 historical windows yielded a qualifying sale, that's ~6%, close to what S1-4 derived. The 0.25 multiplier applied to 9.8% gives 2.5%, below even the empirical base rate. Rounding to 6% is sensible but the mechanical discount is slightly over-applied. **3/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Concise but complete: halved (65d→32d → ~3%), doubled (130d → ~15%). **3/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Paraphrase accurate. Uses 9.8% as starting base rate (correctly uses cross-pollinated input). Consistency check: "About 6 out of 100 times." 4 key evidence items. Blind spot (Picasso estate emergency consignment in April). Status quo clear. **4/4**

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- Update direction correct
- 6% is consistent with the empirical base rate derived by S1-4 and S1-5, which is encouraging — the o3 inside-view instance converges to what o3 would have derived on its own even starting from the GPT-5.2 Poisson estimate

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Three-level framework. Strong negative: 90%+ of $100M+ painting sales in May/November; no catalogued lot ≥$100M in March-London or April-HK catalogues; soft 2024–25 turnover. Moderate positive: trophy demand alive (Klimt $236M); Sotheby's Breuer HQ opening demonstrates ambition. Weak: rumor mill "can move fast." **3/4** (the "Sotheby's Breuer HQ" point is remotely relevant at best; the "unverified Frida Kahlo estate testing market" rumor is a borderline hallucination — no source for this appears in the research)
- **Update from Base Rate:** (Input: 5.6% → Output: 3%, Δ = -2.6pp). However, S2-5 actually reverts to 3% raw base rate rather than 5.6%: "Outside view base rate for Mar–Apr window 2010-25 = 3%." This is the empirical 1/32 count rather than S1-5's adjusted 5.6% — it essentially ignores S1-5's trend and surprise adjustments and reanchors at the raw count. Adjustments: +0.5pp trend, +1pp late-announcement, -1.5pp no announced lots = 3%. The reversion to raw base rate is slightly inconsistent with instruction to use the cross-pollinated outside view as the starting point. Direction correct. **3/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Concise: halved (≈1 month → lower, London sales over; only HK remains), doubled (≈130 days → >20%, includes mid-May NY season). **3/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** Condensed format but complete. Paraphrase accurate. Outside view: 3%. Consistency check present. 5 key evidence items. Blind spot (da Vinci/Michelangelo special April sale). Status quo clear. **4/4**

**Binary-specific assessment:**
- The "unverified Frida Kahlo estate testing market" mention is a weak hallucination risk — no research source supports this claim
- Otherwise sound analysis; 3% is at the lower bound of the ensemble
- The reversion to raw 3% base rather than using S1-5's 5.6% means cross-pollination was partially absorbed

- **Score:** 13/16

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 13% | 9% | -4pp | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 5% | 3% | -2pp | 16/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 12% | 9% | -3pp | 15/16 | Yes (minor arithmetic) |
| S2-4 | o3 | 9.8% | 6% | -3.8pp | 14/16 | Yes (seasonality factor slightly aggressive) |
| S2-5 | o3 | 5.6% | 3% | -2.6pp | 13/16 | Partial (reverts to raw base rate, minor hallucination risk) |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**S2-2 (Sonnet 4.6, receives S1-4/o3):** This is the clearest cross-pollination effect in the run. S2-1 (Sonnet receiving its own Sonnet outside view at 13%) produces 9%, while S2-2 (Sonnet receiving o3's outside view at 5%) produces 3% — a 6pp gap between the two Sonnet instances. S2-2 meaningfully engaged with S1-4's lower anchoring point and the o3-specific argument about "empirical window count." Cross-pollination directly lowered the final Sonnet prediction by 6pp.

**S2-3 (GPT-5.2, receives S1-2/Sonnet 4.6):** Engaged with the Sonnet outside view framework (Poisson-based 12%) but applied its own stronger downward adjustments, arriving at 9%. This is consistent engagement — GPT-5.2 used the Sonnet methodology as a starting anchor and independently verified the direction of updates. The cross-pollination contributed to methodological diversity rather than model-specific anchoring.

**S2-4 (o3, receives S1-3/GPT-5.2):** Started from GPT-5.2's 9.8% Poisson estimate. o3 applied a strong seasonality discount (×0.25) to arrive at 6% — which coincidentally matches what the o3 instances would have derived from their own base rate. The cross-pollination appears to have had limited effect here; the o3 model's analytical style (empirical discounting) dominated over the cross-pollinated anchor.

**Same-model instances (S2-1, S2-5):**
- S2-1 (Sonnet, receives self): 13% → 9%, typical -4pp inside-view downward adjustment
- S2-5 (o3, receives self): ~5.6% → 3%, the most aggressive inside-view discount in the ensemble

**Overall:** Cross-pollination substantially increased diversity. The spread of 6pp (3%–9%) is primarily driven by S2-2 (Sonnet anchored by o3) being 6pp lower than S2-1 (Sonnet anchored by self). Without cross-pollination, the two Sonnet instances would likely have produced similar outputs (~9%), reducing the ensemble's effective model diversity. The mechanism worked as intended.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

All five instances correctly understood the resolution criteria:
- Public auction only (not private) — correctly flagged the Christie's Rothko CNBC article title (appeared in Google search) as a private sale
- Painting specifically (not sculptures or other media)
- Auction must be at Christie's, Sotheby's, or Phillips specifically
- Minimum $100M including buyer's premium (confirmed via Barnebys explainer)
- Before May 1, 2026 (not calendar year 2026)

All instances correctly identified that the November 2025 Klimt $236.4M sale predates the resolution window (opens Feb 25, 2026) and does NOT count.

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Christie's "Art of the Surreal" March 5, 2026 London sale — top lot ~£9.5M, far below threshold
2. No $100M+ painting consignment publicly announced for any spring 2026 sale window through April 30
3. Klimt *Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer* $236.4M at Sotheby's, November 2025 — outside resolution window
4. Annual base rate of nine-figure painting sales: ~1–2 per year since 2013, concentrated in May and November
5. Spring New York marquee week typically occurs in mid-May — after the May 1 deadline
6. Art market in soft phase: Sotheby's sales -23% in 2024; global fine art down 8.8% H1 2025

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-4 | Magritte attribution | States the 2024 Magritte sold at "Christie's London 28 Feb 2024" — auction house correct (Christie's) but "London" is unconfirmed; the agent report doesn't specify city or month | Low |
| S1-5 | Magritte attribution | States "Sotheby's London 2 Mar 2024" — both the auction house (should be Christie's) and the date are uncertain; directly contradicts S1-4 | Low |
| S2-5 | Unverified claim | Mentions "anecdotal talk of a Frida Kahlo estate testing market (unverified)" — no source in research supports this | Low |

### Hallucinations

One minor hallucination risk detected: S2-5's reference to Frida Kahlo estate market rumors has no basis in the research artifacts. All other factual claims are traceable to sources in the search results. No instances hallucinated auction results, dates, or sale prices that contradict the research.

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review

### Divergence & Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Divergence metric | Inside view spread (max - min) |
| Divergence value | 6pp (9% − 3%) |
| Standard deviation | ~2.7pp |
| Trigger threshold | 15pp (binary) |
| Supervisor triggered? | No |
| Supervisor model | N/A |
| Supervisor confidence | N/A |
| Supervisor cost | $0.00 |

**Supervisor not triggered.** The 6pp spread and ~2.7pp standard deviation across inside-view predictions are well below the 15pp binary threshold. This is appropriate: all five instances agreed on the qualitative direction (narrow off-season window, no announced lots, structural timing) with only quantitative variation in the starting base rate. The disagreement was methodological (Poisson vs. empirical count) rather than factual, making supervisor intervention unlikely to resolve the gap. The divergence was 9pp short of the threshold — a comfortable margin.

---

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Strong evidence identification:** All instances correctly identified the three dominant factors — structural timing (May NY sales post-deadline), absence of announced qualifying consignments, and soft art market conditions — and applied consistent directional updates.
2. **Cross-pollination effectiveness:** The mechanism created meaningful diversity. The Sonnet 4.6 instance anchored to o3's 5% (S2-2 → 3%) versus Sonnet anchored to self (S2-1 → 9%) demonstrates genuine model-diversity benefit, not just superficial variation.
3. **Source criticism:** S1-1 (Sonnet) stands out for explicitly identifying and discounting the agent report's embedded 25–40% probability estimate as AI-generated opinion — a methodological issue that all five instances handled appropriately but S1-1 articulated most clearly.

### Weaknesses
1. **Base rate divergence between model families:** Sonnet instances used informal Poisson yielding 12–13% outside views; o3 instances used empirical window count yielding 5–6%. The 7pp gap in outside-view anchors flows through to the inside-view spread. The empirical count approach (o3) is more appropriate for this highly seasonal, non-uniform distribution, making the Sonnet outside views somewhat elevated.
2. **Agent research contamination:** The agentic search output includes a 25–40% probability estimate that is internally inconsistent with the agent's own evidence (absence of announced lots = lower probability) and 4–7× above the ensemble's final output. While all forecasters handled this appropriately, it represents a systematic pipeline quality issue.
3. **Sotheby's press page inaccessible:** One of the three named resolution sources (Sotheby's press) returned HTTP 404. This means the pipeline could not directly confirm the absence of Sotheby's press releases in the resolution window — a limitation in evidence gathering for the highest-stakes source.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: [B]**

The ensemble correctly identified all material factors, reached a well-calibrated 6% that reflects the empirical base rate for pre-May $100M+ painting sales, and demonstrated effective cross-pollination. Deductions for: divergent base rate methodologies between model families creating an unnecessarily wide outside-view spread; embedded probability contamination in the agentic research; and one minor hallucination in S2-5.

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

1. **Enforce factual-only constraint in agentic search output:** The agent report ending with "the probability is moderate but not high — perhaps 25–40%" should be filtered by the pipeline or the prompt should explicitly instruct the agent not to provide probability estimates. This is the highest-priority fix.
2. **Add an artnet / The Art Newspaper whitelist:** Multiple artnet.com articles returned HTTP 403, and these are primary sources for auction market reporting. A specialized scraper or API access for art market publications would substantially improve research quality for art-related questions.
3. **Handle failed primary source scraping more explicitly:** When named resolution sources (Sotheby's press, Christie's press) fail to return content, this should be flagged in the research summary as "failed to access primary source" rather than silently passing null content. Forecasters would benefit from knowing the source was attempted but unavailable.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

1. **Normalize base rate methodology guidance:** The prompt should clarify whether forecasters should use empirical counts or Poisson estimates for seasonal questions. For art auction questions, the prompt might note "auction sales cluster heavily in May and November — uniform distribution assumptions will overstate probabilities in off-season windows."
2. **Cross-pollination anchor acknowledgment:** S2-5 reverted to the raw 3% empirical base rate rather than using S1-5's adjusted 5.6% as the inside-view starting point. The Step 2 prompt might more explicitly instruct: "use the Step 1 prediction from the outside view you received as your base rate, not the raw reference-class base rate."

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.6:** Strong source criticism and evidence weighting. Tends to use informal Poisson for base rates, which systematically over-estimates for seasonal questions. Consider explicit instruction to use empirical window counts for non-uniform phenomena.
- **GPT-5.2:** Most explicit mathematical framework of the three model families; slight arithmetic inconsistency between stated adjustments and final output (12% - 5pp = 7%, but reports 9%). Introduce a "sanity check: does my arithmetic lead to my stated answer?" step in prompting.
- **o3:** Best base rate methodology (empirical window count); may over-apply seasonality discounts mechanically (×0.25 factor in S2-4 is somewhat aggressive). Watch for the reversion pattern (S2-5 reverting from S1-5's 5.6% to raw 3% base rate) which partially defeats cross-pollination intent.
