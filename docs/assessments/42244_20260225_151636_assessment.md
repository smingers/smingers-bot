## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Erroneous PGA TOUR URL returned 2025 results labeled as 2026 | Critical | Research / S1-2 | The fine_print URL (pgatour.com/2026/masters/past-results) was scraped and returned Rory McIlroy's 2025 Masters victory data (McIlroy -11, Rose T2, playoff) under a 2026 URL template. This poisoned all forecasters with "future results." |
| S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) credited the erroneous 2026 results source | Critical | S1-2 | Despite acknowledging the temporal paradox, S1-2 ultimately weighted the PGA TOUR data as "strong evidence" and produced McIlroy 72%, Scheffler 7% — a wildly distorted outside view that bore no relation to market consensus or historical base rates. |
| Agent report hallucinated Scheffler's Augusta record | Medium | Research | The agentic search report listed Scheffler's Augusta finishes as "2022: T3, 2023: WON, 2024: WON (back-to-back)" — incorrectly attributing the 2023 win to Scheffler when Rahm actually won that year. S1-4 and other forecasters caught this inconsistency. |
| S2-3 cross-pollination negated — GPT-5.2 received S1-2's corrupted view | Medium | S2-3 | Because S1-2's input was based on the erroneous source (McIlroy 72%), S2-3 was forced to reject it entirely and produce an independent market-based analysis. The intended cross-model diversity benefit was lost for this instance. |

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (3-step agent, 8 sub-queries) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes (53 articles returned) |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant (MC only) | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (2 URLs: Masters.com failed, PGA TOUR succeeded) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, Agent):
1. "Masters Tournament past winners" (Google) — historical champions list
2. "2026 Masters early odds favorites" (Google News) — pre-tournament betting markets (Oct 2025 and earlier)
3. "Compile statistics on Scheffler, McIlroy, Rahm and DeChambeau at Augusta (2020-2025 finishes, strokes-gained, scoring averages). Note any 2025-26 injuries, coaching or equipment changes, and list top OWGR contenders without a Masters win as of Feb 2026." (Agent) — comprehensive player profiling

**Current Queries** (tools: Google, Google News, AskNews):
1. "2026 Masters odds Scheffler Rahm" (Google) — current betting lines
2. "Early favorites 2026 Masters tournament" (Google News) — current market/field previews
3. "Provide reports on recent performances, injuries, and betting expectations for Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, and other top golfers in the run-up to the April 2026 Masters Tournament at Augusta National in the United States." (AskNews)

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Pre-2026 Masters history + early odds (Oct 2025 and earlier) | Feb 2026 betting lines + recent form |
| Content type | Winners lists, Augusta stats, OWGR, player profiles | Bookmaker odds, Genesis Invitational results, caddie news |
| Tools used | Google, Google News, Agent | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Deep player statistics, injury history, OWGR rankings, field profiling | BetMGM/DraftKings/FanDuel Feb 2026 odds, McIlroy's T-2 at Genesis, Scheffler's first-round scoring struggles |

**Analysis:**
- The historical and current query sets are well-separated. Historical focus is on base rates and player profiles; current focus is on recent market prices and pre-tournament form.
- Historical queries correctly targeted base rate establishment (winners lists, Augusta-specific performance data).
- Current queries effectively surfaced recent decision-relevant data (multiple independent bookmaker consensus as of Feb 2026, most recent form at Genesis Invitational).
- The Agent was an excellent choice for the complex, multi-part historical research task — it executed 8 sub-queries and produced a comprehensive 7-section report.
- AskNews returning 53 articles for the current round provides exceptional coverage depth.
- Critical gap: The Masters.com URL (the primary resolution source) failed to scrape successfully (content extraction failed). This is acceptable since historical records were obtained from ESPN, NBC Sports, and Fox Sports.
- The PGA TOUR URL scraping — included because it appears in the question's fine_print — returned misleading data (see Critical Issues Summary).

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

The Agent report's "2026 Masters Outlook" section includes forward-looking probability-like statements ("Scheffler (World No. 1) is the clear favorite as two-time defending champion," "Fleetwood... is a new and significant contender"). These are narrative assessments, not explicit probability estimates, and appropriately remain at the qualitative level. No research output assigns explicit numerical probabilities. This is appropriate behavior.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** Current betting consensus from multiple bookmakers (BetMGM +275, DraftKings +300, FanDuel +300 for Scheffler); McIlroy's 2025 Masters win and career Grand Slam; historical base rates (no repeat champion since Tiger 2001-02, favorites win ~13% historically); recent form (Genesis Invitational: McIlroy T-2, Scheffler T-12 with noted first-round struggles); OWGR rankings as of Feb 2026; key contenders without Masters wins (Åberg, Morikawa, Fleetwood, Schauffele); player injury status.
- **Critical information missed:** The erroneous PGA TOUR URL was a data quality failure rather than a genuine information gap. No significant gaps in market, form, or historical data.
- **Source quality by tool:**
  - Google/Google News results: High. Multiple reputable sources (Yahoo Sports, CBS Sports, Irish Independent, Sporting News UK, GolfMagic, Pro Golf Now) providing current and accurate betting lines and form data.
  - Agent report: Mixed. Excellent multi-source synthesis with one significant hallucination (Scheffler's 2023 win claim) that was flagged by multiple forecasters.
  - AskNews articles: High. 53 articles covering February 2026 period comprehensively, including BetMGM odds, Genesis results, McIlroy form, and caddie discussion.
  - Question URL scraping: Problematic. Masters.com failed entirely; PGA TOUR URL returned 2025 results under a 2026 URL, creating the core data quality issue for this run.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source's quality, distinguishes fact from opinion, identifies expert sources | Good but incomplete coverage | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Identifies multiple classes, evaluates fit, chooses appropriate one with justification | Reasonable class but weak justification | Questionable class or no alternatives considered | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correctly states window, examines historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation from reference class, mathematically sound, acknowledges uncertainty | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent. Correctly identified the PGA TOUR "2026 results" data as a probable artifact — noting the identical details to 2025 results (McIlroy -11, Rose T2, Reed T3, Scheffler 4th, DeChambeau T5) and explicitly labeled it "almost certainly a data error." Rated all other sources with appropriate credibility levels. Distinguished fact from opinion throughout. **4/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified four relevant classes (betting favorites winning, repeat champions, World No. 1 performance, named players vs. field). Selected the combination of Class 4 with betting market implied probabilities. Good justification, though could have evaluated tradeoffs more explicitly. **3/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 43-day window, noted four consecutive Augusta top-4 finishes for Scheffler. Referenced the historical pattern that "most recent winners had odds between +1,000 and +3,000." **3/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Used betting market implied probabilities as anchors (+360 Scheffler → ~22%, +425 McIlroy → ~19%, +1400 Rahm/DeChambeau → ~7%), applied modest adjustments for overbet favorites, arrived at 20/16/8/8/48. Reasonable calculation but didn't explicitly remove bookmaker margin. **3/4**

**Multiple choice specific:**
- Probabilities assigned to all 5 options; correctly sums to 100%.
- Considers correlations implicitly through the "Other" bucket.
- The 48% "Other" reflects appropriate field depth humility.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Identified the PGA TOUR temporal paradox but then *failed to dismiss it*. Despite explicitly reasoning: "This source either (1) represents actual results that have already occurred (contradicting the stated date), or (2) is a fabricated/simulated source" — the model then proceeded to partially credit it as evidence. This is a fundamental analytical failure. Describes the contradiction but reaches the wrong conclusion. **1/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Identified reasonable classes (betting favorites, repeat champions, named vs. field), but the base rate derivation was immediately superseded by the erroneous source. **2/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated "approximately 6 weeks." **3/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Pre-tournament betting would give reasonable probabilities, but the final derivation abandoned these in favor of the erroneous source: "Given that the question framework includes this source as a 'historical document'... I'll weight it heavily." Final output: Scheffler 7%, McIlroy 72%, Rahm 4%, DeChambeau 4%, Other 13%. This is completely divorced from market consensus and rational base rates. **1/4**

**Multiple choice specific:**
- Sums to 100%, but the distribution is analytically indefensible without the erroneous source.
- Failed to consider that the betting markets (which this forecaster acknowledges at 22-25% Scheffler, 18-20% McIlroy) comprehensively contradict a 72% McIlroy allocation.

- **Score:** 7/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Thorough and methodical. Explicitly dismissed the PGA TOUR "2026 results" as "not credible as evidence today (2026-02-25) because the tournament is in the future." Categorized each source with quality assessment (High/Moderate/Low). Also flagged agent report inconsistencies. The cleanest source analysis of the five outside views. **4/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three well-defined reference classes (all Masters 1934-present, OWGR era 1990-2025, post-2010). Clear evaluation of each. Selected betting-odds implied probabilities as primary baseline, sanity-checked against historical base rates. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated ~6-7 weeks. Noted that even dominant players are "more like mid-teens true probability favorites at majors" in this horizon. **3/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Applied explicit de-vigging calculation (÷1.35 overround): Scheffler 21.7% → 16.1%, McIlroy 19.0% → 14.1%, Rahm 6.7% → 5.0%, DeChambeau 6.7% → 5.0%, Other ~60%. Transparent and mathematically sound. **4/4**

**Multiple choice specific:**
- All options assigned; sums to 100%.
- "Other golfer" correctly identified as plurality (~60%), reflecting strong field-depth humility.
- GPT-5.2 explicitly notes "I am aiming for 'true probability,' not 'pick the likeliest name'"—excellent calibration mindset.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Excellent and concise. Correctly dismissed PGA TOUR 2026 data as "chronologically impossible." Uniquely among all five forecasters, explicitly called out the agent report's inconsistency: "it states Scheffler won 2023 and 2024 back-to-back, conflicting with the other sources showing Rahm won 2023 and Scheffler won 2024." Evaluated sources in order of reliability. **4/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three candidate classes with empirical frequencies derived from 2010-2025 data (n=16): "Pre-tournament favourite won 2/16 times (~13%)," "World top-5 players won 10/16 (~62%)," etc. Best reference class work of all five. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Directly referenced historical precedent: "in each of the last 11 Masters the eventual winner was already inside the top-10 of the betting market six weeks out." This is precisely the right way to use the timeframe context. **4/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 5-step calibration process with explicit bookmaker margin removal (25%), historical favorite-win rate adjustment, and each step documented. Arrived at 20/14/9/6/51. Excellent methodology. **4/4**

**Multiple choice specific:**
- All options assigned; sums to 100%.
- Acknowledges "markets habitually price the very favourite a little too short — favourites have won 13% vs market-implied ~20-25%," correctly redistribting downward from market.

- **Score:** 16/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Solid. Correctly dismissed PGA TOUR 2026 data. Referenced key sources appropriately. Less detailed than S1-4 but covers all critical sources. **4/4**
- **Reference Class Selection:** Three reference classes, selected "OWGR-top-25 players with pre-event odds < 30/1" as the reference class. Strong empirical grounding: "only 3 of last 26 winners came from outside the top-25 OWGR." **4/4**
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correctly stated 44 days. Noted market stability 6 weeks out and that "implied odds six weeks before the Masters are already quite stable." **3/4**
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Used de-vigged odds (25% overround assumption) and applied mild favorite bias correction (-2pp Scheffler, +2pp Others). Final: 17/12/9/6/56. Clear methodology. **3/4** (Slightly less explicit than S1-4 on the exact calculation steps.)

**Multiple choice specific:**
- All options; sums to 100%.
- Correctly identifies that 50-55% for "Other" is realistic given that the strong "Other" contenders (Åberg, Schauffele, Fleetwood, Morikawa) are actually within OWGR top-25.

- **Score:** 14/16

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction (Sch/McI/Rah/DeCh/Other) | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|--------------------------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 20/16/8/8/48 | 13/16 | Correctly identified PGA TOUR error; good source hierarchy | Incomplete overround adjustment; 4 reference classes but weaker selection justification |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 7/72/4/4/13 | 7/16 | Recognized temporal paradox | Failed to dismiss erroneous source; produced analytically indefensible distribution |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 16/14/5/5/60 | 15/16 | Best source evaluation; transparent de-vigging calculation | Slightly conservative (60% Other), could engage more with course-specific factors |
| S1-4 | o3 | 20/14/9/6/51 | 16/16 | Uniquely flagged agent report error; empirical base rates; 5-step calibration | None significant |
| S1-5 | o3 | 17/12/9/6/56 | 14/16 | Clear reference class with OWGR-top-25 filter | Less explicit calibration arithmetic than S1-4 |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Correctly applies Strong/Moderate/Weak framework, identifies key facts | Uses framework but imperfectly | Superficial weighting | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified, explains shift from outside view | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Addresses how prediction changes if window halved/doubled | Mentions but incomplete analysis | Superficial treatment | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | Completes all elements meaningfully | Most elements present | Partial completion | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input (Sch/McI/Rah/DeCh/Other) |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self-model) | 20/16/8/8/48 |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 20/14/9/6/51 |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | 7/72/4/4/13 (corrupted) |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 16/14/5/5/60 |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 17/12/9/6/56 |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: Multiple independent bookmakers (BetMGM +275 = 26.7% implied, DraftKings +300, FanDuel +300); Scheffler's Augusta-specific record; back-to-back rarity. Moderate: McIlroy's current form (leads SG:Approach, T-2 Genesis), Scheffler's first-round struggles. Weak: caddie speculation, post-Grand Slam motivation, Augusta 17th lengthening. Well-structured and complete. **4/4**
- **Update from Base Rate:** (S1-1: 20% Scheffler → 25%, McIlroy: 16% → 13%, Rahm: 8% → 8%, DeChambeau: 8% → 7%, Other: 48% → 47%). Scheffler increases because multiple current bookmakers have moved him to +275-300 (shorter than early +360-425 odds). McIlroy decreases appropriately for back-to-back rarity and post-Grand Slam motivation uncertainty. All adjustments directionally justified. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "If timeframe halved (~21 days): probabilities would barely change. If timeframe doubled (~86 days): we'd be post-Masters." Clear and appropriate analysis of the specific window. **3/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** All 7 items completed: paraphrase ✓, base rate stated ✓, consistency check ✓, key evidence ✓, blind spot ✓, status quo ✓, technicalities check ✓. **4/4**

**Multiple choice specific:**
- Updates preserve sum = 100%.
- Relative probabilities adjusted sensibly (Scheffler up, McIlroy down, slight compression of lower options toward historical base rates).
- Blind spot correctly identified as "Scheffler injury in next 6 weeks" — the highest impact scenario.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: betting market consensus across multiple books (BetMGM +275, DraftKings +300, FanDuel +300), Scheffler's Augusta record and 2025 major wins. Moderate: McIlroy's caddie concerns, Scheffler's first-round pattern, DeChambeau's final-round struggles, historical base rates. Weak: Kim qualification story, retirement speculation, Tiger return. **4/4**
- **Update from Base Rate:** (S1-4: 20% Scheffler → 23%, McIlroy: 14% → 15%, Rahm: 9% → 9%, DeChambeau: 6% → 5%, Other: 51% → 48%). Explicitly stated percentage calculations for each adjustment. Small but principled moves. Market convergence on Scheffler +275-300 (vs. early +360) justified the 3pp increase. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "If halved (~3 weeks): stable, current form carries more weight. If doubled (~3 months): more uncertainty, wider distribution." Clear. **3/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with all 7 items plus explicit sum verification. **4/4**

**Multiple choice specific:**
- Notes the market implies roughly: "Scheffler 25% + McIlroy 13% + Rahm 9% + DeChambeau 8% + field 45%."
- Good cross-check between model output and market implied probabilities.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2

- **Evidence Weighting:** Correctly re-established first principles. Strong: convergent sportsbook markets and structural base rate. Moderate: current form signals (McIlroy form, Scheffler first-round dip). Weak: caddie chatter, DeChambeau's final-round trend. Explicitly corrected the outside view: "Key correction vs outside-view: the PGA TOUR past results page shows 2026 Masters already happened — I treat it as non-evidence." **4/4**
- **Update from Base Rate:** (S1-2: 7/72/4/4/13 → S2-3: 26/14/9/8/43). This is not a standard "update" — it is a complete rejection and reconstruction from market data. The direction is correct (undoing S1-2's McIlroy inflation), but the cross-pollination purpose was defeated. The magnitude shift (+19pp Scheffler, -58pp McIlroy) is justified given the erroneous input, but S2-3 essentially ignored the outside view entirely. **3/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "If halved → lean slightly to market leaders (+1-2pts combined). If doubled → spread more to Other (+2-4pts)." Clear. **4/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete. Consistency check identifies "Other golfer" as most likely correctly. **4/4**

**Multiple choice specific:**
- Final distribution 26/14/9/8/43 is the most aggressive on Scheffler and most conservative on Other among all S2 outputs.
- 43% Other is notably lower than other forecasters' 47-57%. This may reflect GPT-5.2's stronger weighting of Scheffler's Augusta-specific dominance.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: odds consensus (Scheffler ~25-27% implied from multiple books), repeated Augusta top-10s. Moderate: McIlroy defense form, Scheffler's first-round dip, Rahm/DeChambeau LIV implications. Weak: retirement speculation, Tiger return, injury-free declarations. Concise but accurate. **4/4**
- **Update from Base Rate:** (S1-3: 16/14/5/5/60 → S2-4: 18/13/6/4/57). Small, disciplined adjustments: Scheffler +2 (current favorite, elite record), McIlroy -1 (back-to-back drag), Rahm +1 (solid talent, good Augusta history), DeChambeau -1 (final-round struggles), Other -3. The muted updates reflect appropriate humility — the outside view was already well-calibrated. **3/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "If cut to 22 days: probabilities converge to market (+1-2pts Scheffler). If doubled to 88 days: injury/form shifts, Other +3pts." **4/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with all 9 items including explicit sanity check against bookmaker "fair odds." **4/4**

**Multiple choice specific:**
- o3's S2-4 has the highest "Other" allocation at 57%, consistent with o3's strong structural prior for field depth in major championships.
- Correctly notes: "Other wins roughly 60% of the time" historically as a sanity check against its 57%.

- **Score:** 15/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: odds (Scheffler ~25-30% implied), Augusta top-10s and prior wins. Moderate: McIlroy's defense form, Scheffler's first-round dip, Rahm/DeChambeau LIV form. Weak: caddie speculation, retirement chatter. **4/4**
- **Update from Base Rate:** (S1-5: 17/12/9/6/56 → S2-5: 22/14/8/5/51). Scheffler gets the largest individual adjustment (+5pp), driven by "markets now quote him a shorter price than in October" and no injury concerns. McIlroy +2 (defending champ, hot iron play). DeChambeau -1 (Sunday struggles). Other -5pp redistributed to top players. **4/4**
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** "If halved (3 weeks): converge to market. If doubled (3 months): Other +3pts." Clear. **4/4**
- **Calibration Checklist:** Complete with all 9 items including explicit overround removal sanity check (favourite share ~40-45% consistent with fair book). **4/4**

**Multiple choice specific:**
- Most significant upward Scheffler revision of all inside view outputs.
- Notes "markets price Scheffler at ~25% implied; widest gap to field since 2015" — specific market context that validates the adjustment.

- **Score:** 16/16

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

### Assessment

**S2-2 (Sonnet 4.6 receiving o3's S1-4):** Effective cross-model influence. S2-2 explicitly used S1-4's distribution (20/14/9/6/51) as its "outside view base rate" and made modest adjustments. The cross-model pollination introduced the o3 model's more conservative McIlroy estimate (14% vs. S1-1's 16%) into a Sonnet instance, slightly deflating McIlroy's probability relative to S2-1. This represents successful diversity generation.

**S2-3 (GPT-5.2 receiving Sonnet 4.6's corrupted S1-2):** Cross-pollination was *negated by necessity*. Because S1-2's input was built on the erroneous PGA TOUR source (McIlroy 72%), GPT-5.2 correctly dismissed the outside view and reconstructed from first principles. The intended mechanism — GPT-5.2 synthesizing a Sonnet-flavored outside view — did not occur. Instead, S2-3 produced its own market-based analysis. This is the right decision, but it means one of five cross-pollination instances provided zero cross-model diversity benefit.

**S2-4 (o3 receiving GPT-5.2's S1-3):** Effective cross-model influence. S2-4 used S1-3's distribution (16/14/5/5/60) as its base rate and made small adjustments. The GPT-5.2 outside view's notably high "Other" (60%) influenced o3 — S2-4 arrived at 57% Other, higher than the o3 self-reference in S2-5 (51%). This shows GPT-5.2's strong "field depth" prior moderating o3's tendency toward somewhat larger named-player probabilities.

**Same-model instances (S2-1 and S2-5):** Both behaved normally with modest self-reinforcement. S2-1 inherited Sonnet's 20/16/8/8/48 and moved slightly, ending at 25/13/8/7/47. S2-5 inherited o3's 17/12/9/6/56 and moved more aggressively on Scheffler (+5pp).

**Overall:** Cross-pollination increased diversity in 2 of 3 cross-model instances (S2-2 and S2-4 showed meaningful inter-model influence). The failure of S2-3 was unavoidable given the corrupted S1-2 input. The diversity between same-model instances (S2-1 and S2-2 both Sonnet) is larger than might be expected (25/13 vs. 23/15 for Scheffler/McIlroy), indicating cross-pollination successfully differentiated Sonnet's two inside view outputs.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All 5 inside view instances correctly understood the resolution criteria (winner of 2026 Masters per Masters.com by May 1, 2026).
- All instances correctly identified the forecast window (approximately 43-44 days until April 9 tournament start).
- All instances correctly assessed the current state of affairs (tournament not yet played, McIlroy defending as 2025 champion, Scheffler as World No. 1 and betting favorite).

### Factual Consensus

Facts all/most outputs correctly identified:
1. Rory McIlroy won the 2025 Masters in a playoff over Justin Rose, completing his career Grand Slam.
2. Scheffler is World No. 1 and the pre-tournament betting favorite (~+275-300 across multiple bookmakers).
3. No repeat Masters champion since Tiger Woods (2001-02) — a significant structural constraint on McIlroy's back-to-back probability.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Research (Agent) | Hallucination | Agent report lists Scheffler's Augusta finishes as "2022: T3, 2023: WON, 2024: WON (back-to-back)." This is wrong: Scheffler finished T3 in 2022 per the agent but actually *won* in 2022; Rahm won 2023; Scheffler won 2024. The agent confused "won" with the correct years. | Medium — multiple forecasters caught this; it would have distorted Rahm's probability if trusted. |
| Research (PGA TOUR URL) | Data artifact | URL in the question's fine_print returned 2025 Masters results (McIlroy winning) under a 2026 URL template. This is not an analytical error but a data pipeline failure. | Critical for S1-2 |
| S2-4 (o3) | Minor imprecision | States "repeat Masters winners (already owned a green jacket) occurred 7/16 (~44%)" — this refers to winners who already had a green jacket, not consecutive years. Accurate framing but could be clearer. | Low |

### Hallucinations

The Agent report hallucinated Scheffler's Augusta results (winning 2023 when Rahm actually won). This is a confirmed hallucination — the agent's claim directly contradicts the Fox Sports, NBC Sports, and ESPN historical records included in the same research context. Notably, **S1-4 (o3) explicitly identified this hallucination**: "the agent report states Scheffler won 2023 and 2024 back-to-back, conflicting with the other sources showing Rahm won 2023." All inside view forecasters used the correct record (Scheffler 2022 and 2024 wins) in their reasoning, suggesting the hallucination did not propagate.

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review (Optional)

### Divergence & Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Divergence metric | max_option_range (maximum probability spread across forecasters for any single option) |
| Divergence value | 15.2pp (Other golfer: 43%–58%) |
| Trigger threshold | 25.0pp (multiple_choice) |
| Supervisor triggered? | No |
| Supervisor model | N/A |
| Supervisor confidence | N/A |
| Supervisor cost | $0.00 |

Supervisor not triggered. The 15.2pp divergence on "Other golfer" is 9.8pp below the 25pp threshold. The disagreement between F3 (GPT-5.2 at 43% Other) and F4 (o3 at 58% Other) represents a legitimate methodological difference (GPT-5.2 weighing course-specific factors more heavily vs. o3's stronger structural field-depth prior) rather than a resolvable factual dispute. The threshold appears appropriately calibrated — triggering a supervisor here would likely produce additional churn without new information.

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Exceptional research depth and breadth.** The pipeline surfaced multiple independent bookmaker odds (BetMGM, DraftKings, FanDuel, Covers), recent form data (Genesis Invitational), comprehensive player histories, and OWGR context from 53 AskNews articles plus targeted web searches. This represents best-in-class research for a sports forecasting question.
2. **Robust handling of adversarial data.** 4 of 5 outside view forecasters correctly identified and dismissed the poisoned PGA TOUR URL that returned 2025 results under a 2026 template. This is a difficult analytical challenge (the source was from the question's own fine_print) that required models to identify a temporal paradox and trust their priors over a seemingly authoritative source.
3. **Market calibration quality.** The final aggregated probabilities (Scheffler 22.9%, McIlroy 13.9%, Rahm 8.0%, DeChambeau 5.8%, Other 49.4%) align closely with the consensus derived from multiple bookmakers, appropriately adjusted for favorite bias. This is a defensible distribution that would not embarrass a skilled human forecaster.

### Weaknesses
1. **S1-2 critical failure.** One of two Sonnet 4.6 outside view instances failed to properly dismiss the erroneous "2026 results" source despite explicitly recognizing the temporal paradox. The reasoning that "the question framework includes this source as a 'historical document'" represents a reasoning failure under pressure — the model allowed a meta-reasoning about prompt structure to override clear factual evidence (matching 2025 data, temporal impossibility). The resulting 72% McIlroy prediction was indefensible.
2. **Cross-pollination waste for S2-3.** S2-3 (GPT-5.2) was forced to reject S1-2's distorted input entirely, losing the cross-model diversity benefit for this instance. While GPT-5.2 handled the situation correctly, the structural integrity of the cross-pollination design was compromised by S1-2's failure.
3. **Agent report hallucination propagated into research context.** The agentic search incorrectly attributed Scheffler's 2023 win (actually Rahm's). While this was caught by most forecasters, it represents a research quality failure that could have distorted analysis if models had trusted the agent over primary sources.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: B**

Justification: The final forecast output is excellent — well-calibrated to market consensus, with sound analytical reasoning from 4 of 5 outside view instances and all 5 inside view instances. The pipeline demonstrated impressive robustness against data corruption. However, the S1-2 outside view failure (72% McIlroy based on an erroneous source) is significant enough to prevent an A grade — it represents a Critical individual-level failure, even if it was corrected at the inside view stage. The agent report hallucination compounds the research quality concern. The pipeline gets credit for self-correcting, but a cleaner run would have avoided these issues entirely.

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

- **URL scraper validation:** Add temporal validation to the question URL scraper. When a URL returns tournament results for a future event, this should be flagged as a data quality warning and the content should be excluded or marked as potentially erroneous in the context passed to forecasters. Alternatively, the summarizer should explicitly note: "This URL claims to show results for an event scheduled in the future — treat as unreliable."
- **Agent report cross-validation:** The agent's factual claims (e.g., player win history) should be cross-validated against the primary historical sources retrieved in the same research round. When the agent report contradicts ESPN/Fox Sports/NBC Sports on a factual record, the primary sources should be flagged as the authoritative version.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

- **Strengthen source dismissal guidance in outside view prompt:** The outside view prompt should include an explicit instruction: "If any source claims to show results for an event that has not yet occurred (i.e., the event date is after today's date), this source must be treated as unreliable or erroneous and excluded from your analysis." This would have prevented S1-2's failure.
- **S1-2 failure pattern:** This is the second known case of a Sonnet 4.6 outside view instance being confused by "future results" data in the research context. Consider adding a pre-processing step that strips any source content claiming to show results for events dated after the question's `scheduled_close_time`.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- **Sonnet 4.6 (outside view):** Shows a vulnerability to meta-reasoning errors when apparently authoritative sources conflict with clear factual evidence. When presented with a temporal paradox, Sonnet 4.6 can reason itself into accepting the paradox ("the question framework seems to provide this as a historical document") rather than resolving it. This is particularly concerning for sports forecasting questions where tournament result pages are frequently scraped.
- **o3 (outside view):** Strongest analytical performance. S1-4 was the only forecaster to both dismiss the PGA TOUR error AND explicitly flag the agent report hallucination — demonstrating superior cross-source consistency checking. The o3 models' tendency toward higher "Other" probabilities (51-56% vs. Sonnet's 48%, GPT-5.2's 60%) reflects a calibrated field-depth prior appropriate for major championship golf.
- **GPT-5.2:** Excellent self-correction at S2-3. The decision to reconstruct from first principles rather than anchor on the corrupted S1-2 input was analytically sound. GPT-5.2's notably conservative "Other" estimate (43% inside view vs. competitors at 47-57%) may reflect stronger weighting of course-specific player dominance factors.
