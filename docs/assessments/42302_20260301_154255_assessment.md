## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Timeframe inconsistency: 31 vs 61 days | High | S1-1, S2-1, S2-3 | Forecaster 1 and 3 used a 31-day window (March 1–April 1) while resolution criteria require incidents "before May 1, 2026"; correct remaining window from March 1 is 61 days. This halves the exposure and would systematically lower probability if applied consistently. |
| Cloudflare Status Page not scraped | Medium | Research | Pre-research failed to extract content from cloudflarestatus.com (both history and Feb 4 incident URL). Forecasters relied on secondary sources for which incidents are "Critical" (red); primary resolution source was unavailable. |
| AskNews "reliability 2026" results mostly off-topic | Low | Research | AskNews query for "Cloudflare reliability improvements 2026 initiative" returned quantum certs, frontend ecosystem, logistics; only one item (InfoQ Code Orange) was directly on-topic. |

**Note:** Ensemble spread (38–57%, 19 pp) is substantive but reflects genuine disagreement on base rate and Code Orange impact, not critical reasoning errors.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

This run used the **iterative planner** (single plan phase). Queries are in `research/query_plan.md`; execution is in `search_research_plan.json`; partitioned context in `search_historical.json` and `search_current.json`.

### Research Tools by Stage

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | No (current used News/AskNews) | Yes |
| Google News | No | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes |
| FRED | No | No | No |
| yFinance | No | No | No |
| Google Trends | No | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical queries** (Google × 4, Agent × 1):
1. Cloudflare status critical incidents history (Google)
2. site:cloudflarestatus.com "[Critical]" 2023 (Google) — *returned no URLs*
3. Cloudflare outage configuration error history (Google)
4. Cloudflare reliability engineering blog incident frequency (Google)
5. During 2018-2022 how many Cloudflare status incidents were labelled Critical and what was the average monthly frequency? (Agent)

**Current queries** (Google News × 2, AskNews × 1):
6. Cloudflare maintenance March 2026 (Google News)
7. Cloudflare outage February 2026 postmortem (Google News)
8. Cloudflare reliability improvements 2026 initiative (AskNews)

### Assessment Table

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | 2018–2022 base rate, 2023 sample attempt, config/outage history, SRE blogs | Feb 2026 postmortem, March 2026 maintenance, 2026 reliability initiatives |
| Content type | Status-page semantics, incident counts, root-cause patterns | Recent postmortems, planned changes, contrarian (reliability) evidence |
| Tools used | Google, Agent | Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Agent produced 2018–2022 Critical count (4 in 60 months ≈ 0.067/mo) and clustering note; controld.com/Datayard/Cloudflare blog filled drivers | Official Feb 20 BYOIP postmortem, Code Orange timeline, maintenance windows |

**Analysis:**
- Historical and current query sets are clearly separated; no redundancy. Historical targeted base rate (Agent + Google) and drivers; current targeted post-Feb 2026 state and mitigation.
- Base rate was successfully established via Agent and third-party outage lists (controld.com, ilert, Cloudflare blog). The site:cloudflarestatus.com 2023 query returned no URLs, so direct status-page historical sampling failed.
- Current queries surfaced the Feb 20 BYOIP postmortem (Code Orange bug), Code Orange timeline (end Q1 2026), and maintenance; AskNews returned many tangentially related articles.
- Critical gap: Cloudflare Status Page content extraction failed in pre-research, so forecasters had no direct view of which incidents are labeled "Critical" (red); they inferred from blog and press.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research summaries and Agent report stay factual (incident counts, timelines, root causes). No research artifact states a probability for "another critical incident before May 2026."

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** (1) 2018–2022 Critical rate ~0.067/month and clustering; (2) Nov/Dec 2025 and Feb 4/Feb 20 2026 incidents with root causes; (3) Code Orange: Fail Small and Feb 20 outage caused by its own automation; (4) multiple failure modes (config, BGP, third-party storage); (5) scheduled maintenance (e.g. PDX Feb 25–26, BOG/LIS/GRU early March).
- **Critical information missed:** Primary Cloudflare Status Page history and current red-label list (scraping failed).
- **Source quality:** Google/News: high (Cloudflare blog, IT Pro, InfoQ, controld.com). Agent: structured and useful (4 Critical in 60 months, clustering). AskNews: mixed (one strong Code Orange hit; rest off-topic or generic).

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Explicit review of 11 sources (Wikipedia, Guardian, AP, Datayard, Status, IT Pro, Fail Small blog, controld, ilert, Agent, Pragmatic Engineer); quality and fact/opinion noted. Status page correctly treated as primary for resolution.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Multiple classes (2018–2022 Critical-only, broader major outages 2023–Feb 2026, recent 6-month). Chose recent accelerated rate as most suitable, with caveat that "critical" label may not match all major incidents.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** **Error:** States "approximately 31 days (1 month)" and uses resolution window "March 1, 2026 to April 1, 2026." Resolution criteria require incidents before May 1, 2026; remaining window from March 1 is 61 days.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Poisson from historical (~6.5%/month) and recent elevated rate; revised mid-analysis from 62% to 55% after reconsidering which incidents count as "critical."

**Question-type-specific:** Derived 55% with Yes/No pathways and Code Orange mitigation; final outside view 55%.

- **Score:** 12/16 (strong sources and reference class; timeframe error and internal revision reduce timeframe/base-rate points)

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Ten sources with quality and fact/opinion; Status page as primary; Agent report noted as secondary synthesis.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Cloudflare Critical/P0 2018–present; rejected broader cloud and all-severity Cloudflare.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct: "1 Mar 2026 → 30 Apr 2026 inclusive = 61 days."
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Explicit counts 2018–2026 YTD; long-run 1/yr, last 24 mo 2.5/yr, last 12 mo 5/yr; weighted mix (0.6 medium, 0.25 conservative, 0.15 high) → 32.8%, +2% uncertainty → 34.8%.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Same 11 sources as S1-4 (Wikipedia through Agent), each with quality and fact/opinion; Status as resolution source, Agent as medium-low for direct counts.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Cloudflare "Critical" multi-year, tempered with recent regime; rejected heterogeneous cloud and recent-only.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct: "about 61 days (~2.0 months) remaining."
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Bayesian shrinkage: (4+5)/(60+9) ≈ 0.130/month, compromise ~0.145/month; P(≥1 in 2 months) ≈ 0.252.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Same structure as S1-3 (GPT-5.2); careful fact/opinion and quality per source.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same as S1-3; multi-year Cloudflare Critical with tempered update.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct: 61 days.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Same shrinkage and 25.2% as S1-3.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Matches S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6): ten sources, Status primary, Agent secondary.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Cloudflare Critical/P0 2018–present.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Correct: 61 days.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Same as S1-2: weighted Poisson mix → 34.8%.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 55% | 12/16 | Rich source set and reference-class discussion | 31-day timeframe error; mid-stream revision |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 34.8% | 14/16 | Clear 61-day window and explicit rate tiers | Slightly sparse source-by-source critique |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 25.2% | 14/16 | Shrinkage from long-run to recent cluster | Same as S1-4 (duplicate logic) |
| S1-4 | o3 | 25.2% | 14/16 | Same Bayesian shrinkage, clear uncertainty | Duplicate of S1-3 |
| S1-5 | o3 | 34.8% | 14/16 | Same as S1-2 (61 days, weighted rates) | Duplicate of S1-2 |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self-model) | 55% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 25.2% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | 34.8% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 25.2% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self-model) | 34.8% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments (abbreviated)

- **S2-1 (Sonnet 4.6), receives S1-1:** Strong evidence (Feb 20 BYOIP from Code Orange, four incidents, multiple failure modes); calibration checklist complete. Update 55% → 57%. **Timeframe:** Still uses 31-day window in checklist. Score: 13/16.
- **S2-2 (Sonnet 4.6), receives S1-4:** Engaged with 25.2% base; 61-day window; weighted Poisson and Code Orange failure → 44%. Checklist complete. Score: 14/16.
- **S2-3 (GPT-5.2), receives S1-2:** Strong/moderate/weak evidence; 31-day window **error** (March 1–April 1); 55% → 42% with "critical" bar and mitigations. Score: 12/16.
- **S2-4 (o3), receives S1-3:** Two regimes (high/low hazard), 61 days; 25.2% → 38% with change freeze and "Major" vs "Critical." Checklist complete. Score: 14/16.
- **S2-5 (o3), receives S1-5:** Three-scenario blend, 61 days; 34.8% → 46% with code-freeze and "Critical" bar. Checklist complete. Score: 14/16.

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 55% | 57% | +2 | 13/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 25.2% | 44% | +18.8 | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 34.8% | 42% | +7.2 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-4 | o3 | 25.2% | 38% | +12.8 | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 34.8% | 46% | +11.2 | 14/16 | Yes |

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):** S2-2 (Sonnet, received o3’s 25.2%) moved up sharply to 44%, with explicit Poisson and Code Orange discussion. S2-3 (GPT-5.2, received Sonnet 34.8%) and S2-4 (o3, received GPT-5.2 25.2%) each updated upward with evidence; no one ignored the received base rate.
- **Same-model (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 stayed near S1-1 (55→57%); S2-5 moved S1-5 (34.8%) up to 46%. Diversity preserved.
- **Diversity:** Spread 38–57% (19 pp) reflects different base rates (25–55%) and different weights on Code Orange and "Critical" bar; cross-pollination did not collapse views.

---

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- Resolution criteria (after Feb 25, before May 1, Critical per Cloudflare Status) were understood by all. Primary source (status page) was cited even though its content was not successfully scraped.
- **Timeframe:** S1-1, S2-1, S2-3 used a 31-day window (to April 1); others used 61 days (to April 30 / before May 1). The prompt metadata says "Resolves: 2026-04-01"; the resolution criteria say incidents must occur "before May 1, 2026," so the correct remaining window from March 1 is 61 days. This is a meaningful inconsistency.

### Factual Consensus

1. Nov 18, 2025 and Dec 5, 2025: major Cloudflare outages; config/automation causes.
2. Feb 4, 2026: critical incident (live broadcasts); Feb 20, 2026: BYOIP outage (6h7m), caused by Code Orange automation bug (Cloudflare blog).
3. Code Orange: Fail Small announced; phased rollouts and full deployment expected end of Q1 2026.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S1-1, S2-1, S2-3 | Wrong forecast window | 31 days (Mar 1–Apr 1) instead of 61 days (Mar 1–before May 1) | High for calibration (understates exposure) |

### Hallucinations

None identified; incident dates, causes, and Code Orange narrative match research.

---

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review (Optional)

Supervisor was **not** triggered. Binary threshold in config is 15 pp; ensemble spread was 19 pp. No supervisor artifacts present. Divergence was above threshold; if the implementation uses a different metric (e.g. std dev) or only runs in certain conditions, that would explain no trigger.

---

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Research design:** Planner correctly separated historical (base rate, drivers) vs current (postmortem, maintenance, reliability initiatives); Agent query produced a clear 2018–2022 Critical count and clustering.
2. **Reference class and math:** Multiple forecasters used Poisson and explicit rate tiers (long-run vs 24 mo vs 12 mo) or Bayesian shrinkage; "Critical" vs "Major" and Code Orange impact were discussed.
3. **Evidence weighting:** Inside-view stages applied Strong/Moderate/Weak and tied updates to Feb 20 postmortem and Code Orange.

### Weaknesses

1. **Timeframe error:** 31-day window in S1-1, S2-1, S2-3 understates exposure and would bias probability downward if applied consistently.
2. **Missing primary source:** Cloudflare Status Page scraping failed; no direct list of red-labeled incidents.
3. **Duplicate reasoning:** S1-3/S1-4 and S1-2/S1-5 are model-duplicate pairs with identical outside-view numbers and logic.

### Overall Quality Grade

**This Forecast Grade: B**

Good research and structured base-rate reasoning; one high-severity timeframe inconsistency and missing primary source prevent an A. No critical factual or logical errors; spread is interpretable.

---

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

- Fix or substitute for Cloudflare Status Page extraction (e.g. different scraper, cached snapshot, or manual seed for critical-incident list).
- Add a current query that explicitly targets "Cloudflare status page critical incidents 2026" or "site:cloudflarestatus.com 2026."

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

- Clarify in prompts: "Incident window for this question is [start] to [end]; do not use the question’s resolution date as the end of the incident window" when resolution date differs from window end (e.g. resolve April 1, window before May 1).
- Consider deduplicating or diversifying prompts for same-model pairs (S1-2/S1-5, S1-3/S1-4) to reduce identical outputs.

### Model-Specific Feedback

- Sonnet 4.6 (S1-1): Double-check timeframe from resolution criteria vs metadata "Resolves" field.
- GPT-5.2 (S2-3): Same 31-day fix; otherwise solid evidence weighting and checklist.
