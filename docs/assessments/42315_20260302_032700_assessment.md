## Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Supervisor overrode ensemble using wrong evidence** | **Critical** | Supervisor | The resolution source is arena.ai/leaderboard/text. Pre-research scraped that URL and showed **Anthropic #1/#2 (1503), Google #3 (1500)**. The supervisor’s targeted search returned only **third-party** sources (openlm.ai, whatllm.org, Agent report) claiming Gemini 3.1 Pro #1. The supervisor treated these as “multiple sources now indicate Gemini 3.1 Pro is currently #1” and sided with forecasters 1 and 3, then set 50%. That reasoning is wrong: primary-source data said Anthropic #1; non-primary claims do not override it. The supervisor discarded the ensemble’s work and submitted a forecast built on a false premise. |
| Search Arena used as proxy for Text Arena | Medium | S2-2, S2-4, S2-5 | Several forecasters (2, 4, 5) leaned on Search Arena snapshot (Anthropic #1, Google #4–5, ~37 Elo gap) to infer Text Arena standings. Resolution uses Text Arena Overall only; cross-board correlation was assumed, not verified. |
| Base-rate framing split (share-of-days vs turnover rate) | Medium | S1 / S2 | S1-1/S1-3 used “Google ~50% of recent #1 days” → ~45% / ~31%. S1-2/S1-5 used “~10% chance of turnover in 13 days” → ~10%. Same Agent report supported both; methodological choice drove ~35 pp spread. |

**Severity definitions:** Critical = fundamentally compromises forecast; High = significantly affects quality; Medium = notable weakness, core forecast intact; Low = minor.

## Summary

- **Question ID:** 42315
- **Question Title:** Will any Google Gemini model rank #1 on the LMSYS (LM Arena) leaderboard on March 15, 2026?
- **Question Type:** binary
- **Forecast Date:** 2026-03-02
- **Resolution Date:** 2026-03-15 (not yet resolved)
- **Forecast Window:** 13 days
- **Final Prediction:** 50% (supervisor override; ensemble weighted average was 26.8%)
- **Step 2 Predictions:** S2-1: 43%, S2-2: 7%, S2-3: 42%, S2-4: 26%, S2-5: 16%
- **Spread:** 36 percentage points (7% to 43%)
- **Total Cost:** $1.52
- **Duration:** 363 seconds
- **One-sentence quality assessment:** Research and outside view were strong and the ensemble spread (7–43%) reflected genuine uncertainty; the supervisor then invalidated the forecast by treating third-party claims that “Gemini is #1” as dispositive over the primary source (arena.ai scrape: Anthropic #1, Google #3), overriding the ensemble to 50% on a false premise and wasting the work done up to that point.

## 1. Research Query Analysis: Historical vs. Current

### Research Tools by Stage

This run used the **iterative planner** (single plan, then partition into historical/current). Pre-research scraped the question URL (arena.ai/leaderboard/text).

| Tool | Historical (Outside View) | Current (Inside View) | Actually Used? |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Google (Serper) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Google News | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Agentic Search (Agent) | Yes | No | Yes (1 query) |
| AskNews | No | Yes | Yes |
| FRED | If economic/financial | No | No |
| yFinance | If stocks/securities | No | No |
| Google Trends | If relevant | No | No |
| Question URL Scraping | Yes (prepended) | No | Yes (arena.ai/leaderboard/text) |

### Query Discreteness

**Historical Queries** (from query_plan.md; tools: Google, Agent):
1. [HISTORICAL] LM Arena leaderboard archives (Google) — reconstruct #1 rankings and provider turnover
2. [HISTORICAL] Google Gemini LM Arena rank (Google) — prior occasions Gemini topped or nearly topped
3. [HISTORICAL] Analyze historical LM Arena #1 provider frequency 2023-2026; days Google vs Anthropic, OpenAI; tie periods (Agent)
4. [HISTORICAL] LM Arena score methodology (Google) — calculation, update cadence, naming
5. [HISTORICAL] Gemini Ultra release roadmap (Google) — schedules before 15 Mar 2026

**Current Queries**:
6. [CURRENT] Google Gemini model launch 2026 (Google News) — breaking news of new Gemini variant
7. [CURRENT] LM Arena leaderboard March 2026 (Google) — latest leaderboard snapshot
8. [CURRENT] Anthropic Claude upgrade imminent 2026 (AskNews) — contrarian: Anthropic improvements

**Assessment Table:**

| Aspect | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Temporal focus | Base rate 2023–Jan 2026, methodology, release roadmap | Feb–Mar 2026 launches, leaderboard, Anthropic news |
| Content type | Archives, Agent synthesis, FAQ, changelog | News, AskNews packet, leaderboard mirrors |
| Tools used | Google, Agent (1) | Google, Google News, AskNews |
| Unique contribution | Agent report: provider-days at #1 (OpenAI 730, Anthropic 345, Google 175); Arena FAQ (Bradley-Terry); Gemini changelog | Pre-research + current: arena.ai scrape (Anthropic #1, Google #3); AskNews: Claude 4.6 releases, Pentagon dispute, user surge |

**Analysis:**
- Queries are well separated: historical = base rate and mechanism; current = latest standings and competitor moves.
- Historical queries successfully supported base-rate derivation (Agent report and pre-research).
- Current queries brought in the Feb 26 arena.ai snapshot (Anthropic #1/#2, Google #3, 1503 vs 1500) and AskNews on Anthropic (releases, controversy).
- Critical gap: No query at forecast time re-fetched the resolution URL (arena.ai/leaderboard/text). The supervisor’s targeted search did not return a fresh primary-source snapshot; it returned only third-party leaderboard mirrors and an Agent synthesis. The supervisor then wrongly treated those non-primary sources as sufficient to conclude “Gemini is currently #1” and overrode the ensemble.

### Do Research Outputs Offer Forecasts?

Research outputs are factual (snapshots, counts, methodology, news). The Agent report and some summaries state rankings and dates but do not inappropriately assign probabilities to the resolution event.

### Research Quality Summary

- **Key information successfully surfaced:** (1) Pre-research: Feb 26 Text Arena snapshot (Anthropic 1503, Google 1500, within MoE). (2) Agent report: provider-days at #1, tie periods, turnover narrative. (3) Arena FAQ: Bradley-Terry, anonymity, pre-release testing. (4) Gemini 3.1 Pro release Feb 19, 2026 (changelog). (5) AskNews: Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.6 releases, Pentagon dispute, user surge.
- **Critical information missed:** A second, verified snapshot of arena.ai/leaderboard/text at forecast time (March 2) to reconcile with openlm.ai/whatllm.org claims that Gemini 3.1 Pro was already #1.
- **Source quality by tool:** Google/Agent: strong for base rate and methodology; pre-research scrape high for official leaderboard. AskNews: strong for Anthropic news; no direct leaderboard data.

## 2. Step 1 (Outside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 1 (Outside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Source Analysis** | Evaluates each source, distinguishes fact from opinion | Good but incomplete | Superficial or misses key sources | Missing or uncritical |
| **Reference Class Selection** | Multiple classes, evaluates fit, justified choice | Reasonable class, weak justification | Questionable class | Missing or inappropriate |
| **Timeframe Analysis** | Correct window, historical patterns over similar periods | Mostly correct, minor gaps | Significant gaps or errors | Missing or wrong |
| **Base Rate Derivation** | Clear calculation, mathematically sound, uncertainty acknowledged | Minor issues but reasonable | Significant errors or unjustified | Missing or nonsensical |

### Step 1 Output Assessments

#### Step 1 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Systematically reviews 10 sources (arena.ai Feb 26, openlm.ai, Vellum, Actrix, WaveSpeed, Agent report, FAQ, t-redactyl, Wikipedia, changelog); flags openlm.ai as speculative but consistent; treats Feb 26 snapshot as most reliable.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Uses “recent competitive era + new model trajectory”: Google ~50% of recent #1 days, Gemini 3.1 Pro new (7 days before snapshot), within MoE of #1.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 13 days to resolution; notes new models often climb as votes accumulate; 13 days allows ranking shifts.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** Blends “roughly 50/50 Anthropic vs Google for top spot” with ~10% other provider → 45–50%; anchors ~45% given Feb 26 shows Anthropic ahead but gap within MoE.

**Question-type-specific:** Binary; derives 45% from near-tie + new-model trajectory; considers both Yes (Gemini climbs/tie) and No (Anthropic holds).

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

- **Source Analysis:** Same set; explicitly downgrades openlm.ai to “noise”; prioritizes arena.ai Feb 26 and Agent report.
- **Reference Class Selection:** “Short-run persistence”: turnover ~once per 200 days ⇒ ~10–11% per 13 days; conditional that new leader is Google ~60% ⇒ ~7%; plus ~3% for statistical tie ⇒ 10%.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 13 days; five historical turnovers in ~650 days; treats current state as “not #1 but 3 Elo behind.”
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 10% from turnover rate + tie margin; cross-checks with 18% unconditional share (adjusted down because not #1 today).

**Question-type-specific:** Binary; 10% for “Google climbs from #3 to #1 by 15 Mar”; both pathways considered.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 3 (GPT-5.2)

- **Source Analysis:** Structured review of same sources; quality labels (high/medium/low); notes arena.ai high for ranks, medium for “is it Gemini”; openlm.ai low/uncertain.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Blends (1) 18.3% full-history and (2) ~54.7% post–Feb 2025 era; weights recent era 65%, full 35% → ~42%; then adjusts down 8–12 pp for “not #1 in latest snapshot” → 30–34%; rounds 31%.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 13 days; near-ties can reshuffle via vote noise; nonstationarity noted.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 30.8% from weighted anchors and short-horizon adjustment.

**Question-type-specific:** Binary; probability for “Gemini #1 on specific date”; both directions considered.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 4 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Virtually identical to S1-3 (same structure and conclusions).
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same blend and adjustment → 30.8%.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Same 13-day and near-tie logic.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 30.8%.

**Question-type-specific:** Same as S1-3.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 1 Output 5 (o3)

- **Source Analysis:** Same as S1-2; openlm.ai as noise; Agent report and arena.ai central.
- **Reference Class Selection:** Same “short-run persistence” and turnover math → 10%.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Same 13-day and turnover frequency.
- **Base Rate Derivation:** 10%.

**Question-type-specific:** Same as S1-2.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

### Step 1 Summary

| Output | Model | Prediction | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| S1-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 45% | 14/16 | Clear synthesis of near-tie + new model | openlm.ai given nontrivial weight despite uncertainty |
| S1-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 10% | 13/16 | Disciplined turnover-rate framing | Ignores “recent era” share-of-days base rate |
| S1-3 | GPT-5.2 | 30.8% | 14/16 | Explicit anchor blend and adjustment | Same snapshot ambiguity as others |
| S1-4 | o3 | 30.8% | 14/16 | Same as S1-3 | Near-duplicate of S1-3 |
| S1-5 | o3 | 10% | 13/16 | Same as S1-2 | Same as S1-2 |

## 3. Step 2 (Inside View) Analysis

### Scoring Rubric - Step 2 (Inside View)

| Dimension | 4 pts | 3 pts | 2 pts | 1 pt |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Evidence Weighting** | Strong/Moderate/Weak applied, key facts identified | Used but imperfectly | Superficial | Ignores or misapplies |
| **Update from Base Rate** | Direction and magnitude justified | Direction correct, magnitude questionable | Questionable direction | Contradicts evidence |
| **Timeframe Sensitivity** | Halved/doubled window addressed | Mentioned but incomplete | Superficial | Missing |
| **Calibration Checklist** | All elements meaningful | Most present | Partial | Missing or perfunctory |

### Cross-Pollination Flow

| Step 2 Instance | Model | Receives Step 1 From | Step 1 Input |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-1 (self) | 45% |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | S1-4 (o3) | 30.8% |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | S1-2 (Sonnet 4.6) | 10% |
| S2-4 | o3 | S1-3 (GPT-5.2) | 30.8% |
| S2-5 | o3 | S1-5 (self) | 10% |

### Step 2 Output Assessments

#### Step 2 Output 1 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-1 (45%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: Feb 26 Text Arena (3 Elo gap, MoE), Gemini 3.1 Pro new/low votes. Moderate: Anthropic 4.6 releases, user surge, recent competitive history. Weak: openlm.ai.
- **Update from Base Rate:** 45% → 43%, Δ = -2%. Small downward adjustment for Anthropic surge and status quo.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved → ~40%; doubled → toward 50/50.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Paraphrase, base rate 45%, consistency line, key evidence, blind spot (openlm.ai could imply 60%+), status quo (Anthropic marginal lead).

**Question-type-specific:** Update direction (slight down) matches evidence; 43% internally consistent.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 2 (Sonnet 4.6): receives S1-4 (30.8%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: Anthropic Opus/Sonnet 4.6 releases, Search Arena gap ~37 Elo, turnover ~10% per 13 days. Moderate: Gemini 3.1 Pro new; weak: Text Arena 3 Elo claim.
- **Update from Base Rate:** 30.8% → 7%, Δ = -23.8%. Large downward revision based on Search Arena and Anthropic momentum.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved → ~5–6%; doubled → ~15–18%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Present; base rate 10% (from S1-4 30.8% reinterpreted via turnover); consistency and blind spot (Text Arena could be much closer) noted.

**Question-type-specific:** Update direction (strong down) follows evidence they weighted (Search Arena, Anthropic); internally consistent but depends on using wrong leaderboard as proxy.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 3 (GPT-5.2): receives S1-2 (10%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: Feb 26 snapshot (3 Elo, overlapping CIs); ties count as Yes. Moderate: Anthropic 4.6 and momentum; Gemini 3.1 Pro recent, fewer votes. Weak: openlm.ai, Search Arena.
- **Update from Base Rate:** 10% (from S1-2) → 42%, Δ = +32%. Effectively replaced S1-2’s framing with “near-tie + tie rule” from same evidence.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved → more status quo; doubled → more chance of flip.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Paraphrase, base rate 45% (from their own prior), consistency, evidence, blind spot (late Gemini release), status quo.

**Question-type-specific:** Large upward move from 10% to 42% is justified by prioritizing Text Arena 3 Elo gap and tie rule over turnover rate; consistent with their evidence weighting.

- **Score:** 14/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 4 (o3): receives S1-3 (30.8%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: none (no contemporaneous Text Arena snapshot). Moderate: Search Arena (Google 4th/5th), Agent report (18% / 55%), Manifold. Weak: blog hints, Anthropic controversy.
- **Update from Base Rate:** 30.8% → 26%, Δ = -4.8%. Trim for status-quo disadvantage and Anthropic 4.6 bump.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved/doubled heuristics given.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Paraphrase, base rate 30.8%, consistency, evidence, blind spot (Gemini 3.2 Flash), status quo.

**Question-type-specific:** Modest down from base; relies on Search Arena and “no Text Arena snapshot” to nudge lower.

- **Score:** 12/16

---

#### Step 2 Output 5 (o3): receives S1-5 (10%)

- **Evidence Weighting:** Strong: turnover rate, Google 18% share. Moderate: Search Arena ~3 Elo (they say “only ≈3 Elo”), Gemini 3.1 Pro launch bump, Anthropic 4.6 ageing, backlash. Weak: speculation.
- **Update from Base Rate:** 10% → 16%, Δ = +6%. Upward for launch bump and Anthropic reputational hit.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity:** Halved → ~13%; doubled → ~27%.
- **Calibration Checklist:** Paraphrase, base rate 10%, consistency, evidence, blind spot (Anthropic patch/4.7), status quo.

**Question-type-specific:** Small up from 10%; both pathways considered; consistent with their mix of turnover + positive Gemini factors.

- **Score:** 13/16

---

### Step 2 Summary

| Output | Model | S1 Input | Final | Delta | Score | Update Justified? |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| S2-1 | Sonnet 4.6 | 45% | 43% | -2 | 14/16 | Yes |
| S2-2 | Sonnet 4.6 | 30.8% | 7% | -23.8 | 12/16 | Partial (over-weighting Search Arena) |
| S2-3 | GPT-5.2 | 10% | 42% | +32 | 14/16 | Yes (re-anchored on near-tie) |
| S2-4 | o3 | 30.8% | 26% | -4.8 | 12/16 | Yes |
| S2-5 | o3 | 10% | 16% | +6 | 13/16 | Yes |

---

## 4. Cross-Pollination Effectiveness

- **Cross-model instances (S2-2, S2-3, S2-4):** S2-2 (Sonnet, received o3’s 30.8%) moved sharply down to 7%, emphasizing Search Arena and Anthropic momentum—distinct from o3’s framing. S2-3 (GPT-5.2, received Sonnet’s 10%) moved up to 42%, re-anchoring on Text Arena near-tie rather than turnover rate. S2-4 (o3, received GPT-5.2’s 30.8%) moved slightly down to 26%. Cross-pollination produced meaningfully different updates.
- **Over/under-weighting:** S2-2 arguably over-weighted the received 30.8% by replacing it with a 7% that relied heavily on the wrong leaderboard (Search vs Text). S2-3 under-weighted the received 10% by shifting to a 42% that prioritized a different slice of the same evidence.
- **Same-model (S2-1, S2-5):** S2-1 stayed close to S1-1 (45% → 43%). S2-5 moved up from S1-5 (10% → 16%). Same-model pairs were not mirror images; S2-5 incorporated positive inside-view factors.
- **Diversity:** Cross-pollination increased spread (7% to 43%) by mixing “turnover-rate” and “share-of-days + near-tie” framings across models.

## 5. Factual Accuracy & Comprehension

### Question Understanding

- All instances understood resolution: Text Arena Overall at arena.ai/leaderboard/text, March 15, 2026, Gemini family #1 by Arena score, ties count as Yes.
- Timeframe (13 days) was stated correctly.
- Current state was disputed: some treated “Google #3, 3 Elo behind” as factual (pre-research); others emphasized “no verified Text Arena snapshot” and used Search Arena or third-party claims.

### Factual Consensus

1. Feb 26 (or similar) snapshot from question URL / pre-research showed Anthropic #1/#2 (1503), Google #3 (1500), gap ~3 Elo, overlapping CIs.
2. Gemini 3.1 Pro released Feb 19, 2026; added to Text leaderboard per changelog.
3. Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 released Feb 5 and Feb 17, 2026; Anthropic had user surge and controversy in Feb–Mar 2026.

### Factual Errors or Ambiguities

| Output | Error/Ambiguity | Description | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| S2-2, S2-4, S2-5 | Search Arena vs Text Arena | Treated Search Arena snapshot (Google #4/#5, ~37 Elo gap) as proxy for Text Arena; resolution depends only on Text Arena Overall. | High for S2-2 (drove 7%); medium for S2-4, S2-5 |
| Multiple | “Current #1” | Pre-research said Anthropic #1; supervisor research later cited sources saying Gemini 3.1 Pro #1 (1505). No direct verification of arena.ai at forecast time. | High (core to spread) |

### Hallucinations

No invented dates or events detected. The main risk is reliance on openlm.ai / whatllm.org / Agent-reported rankings that may not match the official arena.ai/leaderboard/text at the resolution moment; this is source ambiguity rather than fabrication.

## 6. Supervisor Agent Review

### Divergence & Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Divergence metric | std_dev |
| Divergence value | 15.83 |
| Trigger threshold | 15.0 |
| Supervisor triggered? | Yes |
| Supervisor model | Claude Opus 4.6 (quality) |
| Supervisor confidence | MEDIUM |
| Supervisor cost | $0.46 |

### Stage 1: Disagreement Analysis

- **Quality of disagreement identification:** The supervisor correctly identified the main disagreement: what is the current state of the Text Arena Overall leaderboard? Forecasters 1 and 3 relied on a 3 Elo gap and/or third-party claims (openlm.ai) that Gemini might be #1; forecasters 2, 4, 5 were skeptical and emphasized the only primary-source snapshot (pre-research arena.ai scrape: Anthropic #1, Google #3) or used Search Arena as a proxy.
- **Root cause classification:** The factual dispute was “which source is authoritative for *current* #1?” The resolution criterion is the leaderboard **as viewed by Metaculus** at arena.ai/leaderboard/text. The only direct scrape of that URL in this run was pre-research, and it showed Anthropic #1, Google #3. The supervisor’s job was to prefer or re-fetch that primary source, not to treat third-party mirrors as dispositive.

### Stage 1: Search Query Quality

| # | Query | Source | Targets Which Disagreement? | Redundant with Round 1? |
||---|-------|--------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | LM Arena text leaderboard March 2026 rankings (Google) | Google | Current state | Partial |
| 2 | arena.ai leaderboard text overall top model 2026 (Google) | Google | Current state | Partial |
| 3 | What is the current #1 model on the LM Arena Text Arena Overall leaderboard... (Agent) | Agent | Current state | No |
| 4 | Gemini 3.1 Pro LM Arena Elo score rank (Google) | Google | Current state | No |

**Assessment:** Queries targeted “current #1” but the research did **not** return a fresh scrape of the resolution URL. It returned openlm.ai, whatllm.org, Agent synthesis, and other mirrors. None of these are the official resolution source. The supervisor should have required primary-source confirmation (arena.ai/leaderboard/text) before overriding the ensemble; instead it treated secondary sources as sufficient.

### Stage 2: Supervisor Research Quality

- **What the research actually returned:** Agent report citing openlm.ai and aidevdayindia for “Gemini-3.1-Pro #1 at 1505”; whatllm.org article stating “Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview holds the #1 position on LM Arena”; arena.ai **changelog** (model additions, not rankings); Onyx.app and other third-party leaderboards. No direct, timestamped snapshot of arena.ai/leaderboard/text from the supervisor phase.
- **The error:** The pre-research context already contained the only **primary** snapshot in this run: the scrape of the resolution URL showing Anthropic #1 (1503), Google #3 (1500). The supervisor’s “targeted research” did not supersede that with new primary data; it only added **non-primary** claims that Gemini is #1. Treating “multiple sources now indicate Gemini 3.1 Pro is currently #1” as a resolution of the disagreement is wrong: those sources are not the resolution authority. The supervisor elevated third-party and Agent-reported rankings above the actual resolution source and used them to justify overriding the ensemble.

### Stage 2: Supervisor Reasoning & Reconciliation

- **Reasoning quality — failure:** The supervisor wrote: “The targeted research strongly supports the side of forecasters 1 and 3 who claimed the gap was very small, and in fact goes further — multiple sources now indicate **Gemini 3.1 Pro is currently #1** on the Text Arena Overall leaderboard.” That conclusion is **wrong**. The primary source (arena.ai scrape) indicated Anthropic #1, Google #3. The “multiple sources” are openlm.ai, whatllm.org, and Agent synthesis — none of which are the page Metaculus will use to resolve the question. The supervisor conflated “sources that say Gemini is #1” with “evidence that the resolution source shows Gemini #1.” It then reframed the question as “will Gemini maintain #1?” and set 50%, discarding the ensemble’s 26.8% (and the careful work of forecasters 2, 4, 5 who had correctly been skeptical of unverified leaderboard claims).
- **Reconciliation approach:** The supervisor sided with the high cluster (S2-1, S2-3) by accepting the premise that Gemini is already #1. That premise was not supported by the resolution source. The correct move would have been either to (a) re-fetch arena.ai/leaderboard/text and use that as the sole authority for “current #1,” or (b) leave the ensemble forecast unchanged and note that the factual disagreement could not be resolved with primary data. Overriding to 50% on the basis of third-party claims wasted the forecast built up to that point.

### Supervisor Scoring Rubric

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Disagreement Identification | 3/4 | Identified disagreement; did not correctly frame it as “primary vs non-primary source” |
| Query Generation | 2/4 | Queries targeted current state but did not yield primary-source verification |
| Research Novelty | 2/4 | Added non-primary sources; failed to obtain or privilege resolution-source data |
| Reasoning & Reconciliation | 1/4 | Concluded “Gemini currently #1” from wrong evidence; overrode ensemble on false premise |

**Supervisor Score:** 8/16

### Supervisor Impact Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Ensemble weighted average (pre-supervisor) | 26.8% |
| Supervisor prediction (post-supervisor) | 50% |
| Adjustment magnitude | +23.2 pp |
| Was the adjustment an improvement? | **No.** The supervisor’s 50% is based on the claim that Gemini 3.1 Pro is currently #1, which is not supported by the only primary-source snapshot in the run (arena.ai: Anthropic #1, Google #3). The adjustment invalidates the forecast: the submitted probability rests on a false premise and discards the ensemble’s work. |

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Research design:** Iterative planner and pre-research were strong. Base rate, mechanism, and current state were covered; the scrape of arena.ai/leaderboard/text (Anthropic #1, Google #3) was the correct primary source and was in context.
2. **Outside view:** Two coherent framings (share-of-days + near-tie vs turnover rate) with clear reference classes and timeframe. Step 1 and Step 2 produced a defensible spread (7–43%) with real reasoning on both sides.
3. **Skeptical forecasters:** S2-2, S2-4, S2-5 (7%, 26%, 16%) did not trust unverified “Gemini #1” claims; S2-2 in particular emphasized that the only verified leaderboard data (Search Arena) showed Anthropic ahead. That skepticism was appropriate given the single primary snapshot (arena.ai) showed Anthropic #1.

### Weaknesses

1. **Supervisor invalidated the forecast (critical):** The supervisor concluded that “multiple sources now indicate Gemini 3.1 Pro is currently #1” and overrode the ensemble to 50%. Those “sources” were third-party mirrors and an Agent report—not the resolution URL. The only primary-source snapshot in the run (arena.ai scrape) showed Anthropic #1, Google #3. The supervisor preferred non-primary over primary evidence and built the submitted forecast on a false premise. All prior work—research, outside view, inside view, aggregation—was effectively discarded.
2. **Search Arena conflation:** S2-2, S2-4, S2-5 used Search Arena (different board) as a proxy for Text Arena; that was a separate weakness but did not justify the supervisor’s error (which was to trust non-primary “Gemini #1” claims instead of the primary scrape).
3. **No primary-source re-check:** Neither Round 1 nor the supervisor phase re-fetched arena.ai/leaderboard/text. When targeted research returned only third-party rankings, the supervisor should have refused to override the ensemble, not treated those as dispositive.

### Overall Quality Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | Excellent research, sound reasoning, appropriate calibration, no major errors |
| B | Good overall, minor issues in reasoning or evidence handling |
| C | Adequate, notable weaknesses but core reasoning intact |
| D | Below standard, significant reasoning or factual issues |
| F | Poor, major errors, unreliable output |

**This Forecast Grade: D**

Rationale: Research and the five-forecaster pipeline were solid; the ensemble spread (7–43%) reflected genuine uncertainty and some forecasters correctly privileged or inferred from the primary snapshot. The supervisor then made a fundamental error: it treated third-party and Agent claims that “Gemini is #1” as sufficient to override the ensemble, despite the only primary-source data (arena.ai scrape) showing Anthropic #1, Google #3. The submitted 50% is not a reasonable reconciliation of disagreement—it is a forecast conditioned on a false premise. The work built up to the supervisor step was wasted; the final forecast is below standard.

## 8. Recommendations

### Research Improvements

- When resolution depends on a specific URL (e.g., arena.ai/leaderboard/text), the pipeline should treat that URL as the **sole primary source** for “current state.” Re-scrape or re-fetch it in the supervisor phase if resolving a disagreement about current rankings; do not treat third-party leaderboard mirrors or Agent synthesis as substitutes.

### Prompt/Pipeline Improvements

- **Supervisor:** Require that before overriding the ensemble on a “current state” factual claim, the supervisor must have primary-source evidence (the resolution URL or its direct scrape). If targeted research returns only non-primary sources (openlm.ai, whatllm.org, Agent-reported rankings), the supervisor must **not** treat them as dispositive; it should either leave the ensemble forecast unchanged or state that the disagreement could not be resolved with authoritative data.
- In prompts, explicitly distinguish “Text Arena Overall” from “Search Arena” and other Arena boards.
- For questions resolved by a specific page, instruct the supervisor: “Primary source = the URL/source Metaculus will use to resolve. Do not override the ensemble based on secondary or third-party claims that contradict the only primary-source snapshot in context.”

### Model-Specific Feedback

- Sonnet 4.6 (S2-2): Large downward revision from 30.8% to 7% was driven by Search Arena; reinforce using only the resolution-relevant leaderboard. Its skepticism toward “Gemini #1” claims was appropriate.
- Supervisor (Claude Opus 4.6): Do not conclude “X is currently the case” from non-primary sources when primary-source data in context says otherwise. Prefer the resolution source over openlm.ai, whatllm.org, and Agent synthesis for leaderboard rankings.

| Flag | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|
| Output spread >30pp (binary) | Yes | 7% to 43% (36 pp) |
| Update direction errors | No | All updates directionally consistent with stated evidence |
| Factual errors present | Yes | Search Arena used as proxy for Text Arena (S2-2, S2-4, S2-5) |
| Hallucinations detected | No | |
| Cross-pollination effective | Yes | Produced distinct framings and spread |
| Critical info missed in research | Partial | No second verification of official Text Arena at forecast time |
| Base rate calculation errors | No | Different valid framings, not calculation errors |
| Outlier output (>1.5 SD) | Yes | S2-2 (7%) low; S2-1 and S2-3 (42–43%) high relative to mean 26.8% |
| Supervisor triggered | Yes | Overrode ensemble to 50% on false premise (“Gemini currently #1” from non-primary sources); did not improve forecast; invalidated prior work |
