RESPONSE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Candidate Reference Classes:

1. Narrow: 24-month episodes (1979-2026) in which Washington openly contemplated hitting Iranian soil — i.e., (a) 1980 hostage rescue, (b) 1984-88 “Tanker War”, (c) 2006-07 nuclear standoff, (d) 2011 alleged assassination plot, (e) 2019 post-JCPOA collapse/tanker attacks, (f) 2020 post-Soleimani, (g) the present 2025-26 unrest.
   Estimated cases: 7 episodes
   Estimated base rate: ≈ 15-20 % (only the 1980 Eagle Claw raid qualifies)
   For: Same dyad and identical resolution criterion (U.S. weapons on Iranian territory).
   Against: Tiny N; 1980 raid was a special-forces rescue, not a coercive strike, so historical “hit rate” may mislead.

2. Medium: Since 1975, every crisis in which the U.S. launched (or was debating) a one-off or short-duration air / missile strike against a Middle-Eastern or North-African adversary it was not already at war with. Windows defined as two years from first major public crisis signal. Strikes include Libya 1986; Iraq 1993, 1996, 1998; Sudan & Afghanistan 1998; Serbia 1999; Yemen 2002; Pakistan 2011; Syria 2017, 2018, 2023, etc.
   Estimated cases: ≈ 25 crisis-windows; 11 produced kinetic action → base rate ≈ 40-45 %
   For: Good sample size and similar “limited-punitive-strike” logic, using modern U.S. airpower.
   Against: Mixes in far weaker states and terrorism-focused cases; Iran’s stronger deterrent could make this base rate too high.

3. Broad: All country-years worldwide, 1975-2025, in which the U.S. was not already in large-scale war; outcome = “Did U.S. forces conduct any kinetic action against that state in that year?”
   Estimated cases: ~10,000 country-years; ~70 with strikes → base rate ~0.7 %
   For: Huge N, statistically robust.
   Against: Far too diluted; ignores current hostility and vastly under-states risk for an active adversary like Iran.

Recommended Class: Medium
Reasoning: It focuses on the type of event we care about—U.S. limited air/missile attacks on a hostile regional power—yet still provides double-digit sample size, avoiding the noise of the very narrow class and the irrelevance of the broad one.

Estimated Base Rate: ~40 %

Key Uncertainty: Iran’s comparatively strong ability to retaliate (ballistic missiles, proxy networks, threat to Hormuz) might deter Washington much more than the average state in the medium class, pushing the true probability lower.

FULL PROMPT

You are a forecasting expert preparing to research a prediction question.

Before running any searches, your task is to identify the most appropriate reference class(es) for this question. A reference class is a set of past situations comparable enough to the current one that their historical frequency can anchor a base rate.

Good reference class selection is often the most important step in superforecasting: too broad a class dilutes the signal; too narrow a class gives too few cases to be reliable. The goal is the most specific class that still has enough historical cases to be meaningful.

QUESTION: Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?
Type: binary
Today: 2026-02-27
Resolves: 2026-04-01T00:00:00Z

Background:
In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States–backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.

Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.

In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped "bunker-buster" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.

In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;

U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for ["new leadership" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.

[According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:

> Forecasters think there’s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.

Resolution criteria:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel, according to credible sources.

Fine print:
To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military personnel: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.

If it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as ambiguous.

YOUR TASK

Propose 3 candidate reference classes at different levels of specificity:

1. NARROW — A tightly defined class with high comparability to the current situation (possibly few cases)
2. MEDIUM — A moderately scoped class balancing comparability and sample size
3. BROAD — A general class with many cases but lower comparability

For each class, provide:
- A precise description of what historical cases qualify
- Your best estimate of the base rate (even if rough — "~15%" is fine; "unknown" is not useful)
- A brief argument for and against using this class

Then choose the most appropriate class and explain why. Key considerations:
- Does the proposed class actually match the resolution criteria (not just the surface topic)?
- Are the conditions that distinguish this situation from others relevant to the outcome?
- Is the sample size large enough to be informative?

Finally, propose one concrete research query that would confirm or refine the base rate for your recommended class.
