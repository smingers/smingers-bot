RESPONSE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Candidate Reference Classes:

1. Narrow: Years in which the United States has carried out a kinetic military strike that directly hit either (a) Iranian territory or (b) uniformed Iranian military personnel (regardless of location), 1979 – 2026.
   Estimated cases: 4–6 distinct attack-years (1987, 1988, 2020, 2025; possibly 1-2 smaller 1980s skirmish years)
   Estimated base rate: ≈9 % chance that any given year contains at least one qualifying U.S. attack; ≈0.75 % that any given month does.
   For: Matches the resolution criteria exactly; captures unique deterrence/escalation dynamics of U.S.–Iran dyad.  
   Against: Very small sample ⇒ high statistical noise; past attacks are lumpy (clustered), so a simple average may misstate today’s risk.

2. Medium: All limited, stand-alone U.S. air, drone, or missile strikes on sovereign states with which Washington had no formal declaration of war and highly adversarial relations, 1979 – 2026 (e.g., Libya 1986, Iraq 1993 & 1998, Serbia 1999, Syria 2017 & 2018, Iran cases above).
   Estimated cases: ~18–22 operations
   Estimated base rate: ≈45 % that any given U.S. presidential term (4 yrs) sees at least one such strike → ≈1 % that any given month does.
   For: Enlarges the sample while keeping focus on discretionary, punitive raids rather than full wars; decision calculus (signals, deterrence, domestic politics) is broadly similar.  
   Against: Lumps Iran with far weaker states; omits Tehran’s robust retaliation threat, a factor that historically restrains U.S. action.

3. Broad: All instances since 1945 in which any great power (U.S., Russia/USSR, China, UK, France) conducted an overt cross-border attack on a mid-power adversary outside a formal war.
   Estimated cases: 100 + events
   Estimated base rate: >90 % that a random 5-year period somewhere in the world contains at least one such attack → roughly 1.5 % per month for any given dyad.
   For: Very large data set, allowing statistically stable averages.  
   Against: Loses almost all situational similarity (different actors, capabilities, geographies, alliances); base rate is so diluted it offers little guidance for the specific U.S.–Iran question.

Recommended Class: Narrow
Reasoning: The forecasting question is explicitly about a U.S. strike on Iran, not a generalized tendency to launch punitive raids. Only the narrow class aligns precisely with the required outcome and embeds the distinctive mutual deterrence, regional alliance, and domestic-political variables that drive U.S.–Iran escalation. Although the sample is small, it is still more diagnostic than a larger but much less comparable set.
Estimated Base Rate: ~0.75 % for the remaining month (derived from ~9 % per year ÷ 12)

Key Uncertainty: Whether the 2025 U.S. bunker-buster strikes signal a new, higher-frequency phase of armed confrontation, making the historical annual average an under-estimate.

You are a forecasting expert preparing to research a prediction question.

Before running any searches, your task is to identify the most appropriate reference class(es) for this question. A reference class is a set of past situations comparable enough to the current one that their historical frequency can anchor a base rate.

Good reference class selection is often the most important step in superforecasting: too broad a class dilutes the signal; too narrow a class gives too few cases to be reliable. The goal is the most specific class that still has enough historical cases to be meaningful.

QUESTION:
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

Type: binary

Background:
In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States–backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.

Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.

In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped "bunker-buster" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.

In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;

U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for ["new leadership" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.

[According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:

> Forecasters think there’s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.

Resolution criteria:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel, according to credible sources.

Fine print:
To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military personnel: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.

If it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as ambiguous.

PRE-RESEARCH CONTEXT:
The following information has already been gathered from sources referenced in the question. Use this to avoid redundant queries and to identify what additional research is needed.


<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution">
## Summary: Iranian Revolution (Wikipedia)

**Note:** This article is a historical overview of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and does not contain direct information relevant to the question of a future U.S. attack on Iran. Its relevance is primarily as background context.

---

### Key Historical Facts

- **1953 CIA/MI6 Coup:** The U.S. and UK orchestrated the overthrow of democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, reinstating Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as an absolute monarch. American firms subsequently gained ~40% of Iranian oil profits, and the CIA helped fund and train SAVAK, Iran's secret police.

- **Shah's Reforms & Alienation:** The Shah's "White Revolution" (1963–1979) modernized Iran but alienated the clergy and traditional sectors. Ayatollah Khomeini emerged as a vocal critic and was exiled in 1964.

- **Revolution (1977–1979):** Anti-government protests began in October 1977, broadening into a mass uprising. The Shah left Iran on January 16, 1979; Khomeini returned February 1, 1979. By February 11, the monarchy collapsed. A referendum confirmed the Islamic Republic with 98% approval.

- **Post-Revolutionary Ideology:** The new government declared destruction of Israel a core objective, sought to undermine Sunni influence by supporting Shia political movements regionally, and adopted a strongly anti-Western posture — directly reversing the Shah-era alignment with the U.S.

### Relevance to Forecasting Question
The article establishes the **deep historical roots of U.S.-Iran antagonism**, rooted in the 1953 coup and the 1979 revolution. It explains why Iran's government views the U.S. with fundamental hostility, providing context for the current tensions described in the question's background.

## Summary: Iran–United States Relations (Wikipedia Article)

**Note:** This article appears to be a comprehensive Wikipedia entry on Iran-U.S. relations. The content was truncated before reaching the most recent events referenced in the question's background (2025-2026), so the summary reflects what was available.

---

### Historical Foundation
- Relations date to the mid-19th century, initially positive with the U.S. seen as a neutral "third force" against British and Russian colonial interests.
- The **1953 CIA/MI6-backed coup** overthrowing Prime Minister Mosaddegh is identified as a foundational grievance, reinstalling Shah Pahlavi and establishing SAVAK (secret police) with U.S. support. Many historians link this to the anti-American character of the 1979 revolution.

### Post-Revolution Hostility
- **No formal diplomatic relations since April 7, 1980**, following the 1979 revolution and hostage crisis. Pakistan and Switzerland serve as protecting powers respectively.
- In **2018**, Supreme Leader Khamenei formally banned direct talks with the U.S.

### Nuclear Dimension
- The U.S. *originally helped establish* Iran's nuclear program under Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" (1953), providing Iran's first reactor in 1967.
- The **2015 JCPOA** placed limits on Iran's nuclear program; sanctions were largely lifted in 2016.
- The **Trump administration withdrew** from the JCPOA in 2018 and reimposed sanctions ("maximum pressure campaign"), after which Iran gradually exceeded pre-JCPOA enrichment levels.

### Public Opinion
- **2013 BBC poll:** 87% of Americans view Iran negatively (most unfavorable globally).
- **2019 IranPoll:** 86% of Iranians view the U.S. unfavorably (most unfavorable globally), though research suggests most Iranians hold positive views of the *American people*.
- **2018 Pew poll:** 39% of Americans consider limiting Iran's influence a top foreign policy priority.

### Key Structural Tensions Identified
- Iran cites U.S. support for Israel and attempts at "global dictatorship" as drivers of hostility.
- The U.S. cites the hostage crisis, human rights abuses, Iran's nuclear program, and support for proxy groups (Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis).
- The article notes relations *improve* when interests overlap (e.g., countering Sunni militants/ISIS).

*The article does not cover the 2025 U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites referenced in the question's background, as the content was truncated before reaching that period.*

## Summary: Iran–U.S. Relations During the First Trump Administration (2017–2021)

### Overall Character of the Period
The first Trump administration marked a sharp break from Obama-era engagement, pursuing a **"maximum pressure" campaign** against Iran through extensive sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and ultimately military action. Despite escalating tensions, the period stopped short of full-scale war.

---

### Key Policy Actions by the U.S.

- **Travel Ban (January 2017):** Iranian citizens barred from entering the U.S.
- **JCPOA Withdrawal (May 2018):** Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal and reimposed all previously lifted sanctions, eventually totaling **over 1,500 sanctions** targeting Iran's central bank, oil company, shipping lines, and foreign entities doing business with Iran.
- **IRGC Terrorist Designation (April 2019):** The U.S. designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a Foreign Terrorist Organization — the first time official armed units of a sovereign state were placed on such a list.
- **Coalition Building:** The administration strengthened ties with Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Gulf states to counter Iranian regional influence, and cultivated relationships with Iranian opposition groups, including the MEK.

---

### Iranian Responses

- Threatened to resume **unrestricted uranium enrichment** and close the **Strait of Hormuz**
- Supreme Leader Khamenei **banned direct talks** with the U.S. (August 2018), declaring negotiations impossible with the Trump administration
- Iran's parliament designated U.S. forces and allies in the region as **terrorists** in response to the IRGC designation
- Iran launched a **military satellite** and was accused of **election interference** and **proxy attacks**

---

### Key Escalation Events (2019–2020)

- **2019 Tanker Attacks:** Oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf region; Iran was suspected of involvement
- **U.S. Drone Downing:** Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone; Trump **called off retaliatory airstrikes** at the last minute, opting instead for cyberattacks and additional sanctions
- **Saudi Oil Facility Strikes:** Iran was suspected of orchestrating strikes on Saudi Aramco facilities
- **K-1 Air Base Attack (December 2019):** A rocket attack killed a U.S. contractor, leading to U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias and a subsequent attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad
- **Assassination of Qasem Soleimani (January 3, 2020):** The U.S. killed Iran's top general in a drone strike in Iraq, prompting **Iranian missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq**. Iran also accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane during the crisis period.

---

### Diplomatic and Legal Dimensions

- The **International Court of Justice** provisionally ordered the U.S. to cancel sanctions (October 2018); the U.S. responded by **withdrawing from the 1955 Treaty of Amity** with Iran
- The **UN Security Council** rejected a U.S. proposal to extend an arms embargo on Iran; only the Dominican Republic voted with the U.S.
- U.S. allies, including European nations, largely **refused to follow** the maximum pressure approach, leaving Washington diplomatically isolated on several fronts
- A **January 2019 U.S. intelligence assessment** concluded Iran was **not pursuing nuclear weapons**, contradicting some administration rhetoric

---

### Net Effect
The maximum pressure campaign severely damaged Iran's economy — crashing its currency, quadrupling inflation, and sharply reducing oil exports — but failed to bring Iran to the negotiating table. The period ended with relations deeply hostile and all major disputes unresolved.
</QuestionSource>

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action">
## Summary: Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)

### Overview
The JCPOA, finalized in Vienna on **July 14, 2015**, was an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (UN Security Council permanent members plus Germany) and the EU, designed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

### Key Provisions
- Iran agreed to reduce its low-enriched uranium stockpile by **97%** (from 10,000 kg to 300 kg) and cap enrichment at **3.67%** for 15 years
- Active centrifuges reduced to **6,104 units** (only 5,060 allowed to enrich), restricted to older IR-1 models at Natanz
- Key facilities at **Fordow, Natanz, and Arak** repurposed for civilian use
- Iran accepted more intrusive **IAEA monitoring**
- In exchange, Iran received relief from UN, EU, and U.S. nuclear-related sanctions (non-nuclear sanctions remained)

### Collapse of the Agreement
- The **U.S. withdrew in 2018**, reimposing sanctions under its "maximum pressure campaign," effectively nullifying the deal's economic provisions
- Following the **June 2025 Iran–Israel war**, Iran officially announced the **termination of the agreement on October 18, 2025**, after 10 years

### Relevance to Forecasting Question
The article confirms the JCPOA is now formally defunct, removing a key diplomatic framework that had previously constrained Iran's nuclear program and provided a channel for U.S.-Iran engagement.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani">
# Summary: Assassination of Qasem Soleimani

## The Strike

On **January 3, 2020**, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike near Baghdad International Airport that killed Iranian Major General **Qasem Soleimani**, commander of the IRGC's Quds Force. Also killed was **Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis**, deputy chairman of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces and commander of Kata'ib Hezbollah. Five other Iranians and Iraqis died in the strike.

## Justification and Legal Controversy

- The U.S. Pentagon justified the strike as necessary to stop an "imminent attack" and to protect U.S. personnel and deter further Iranian escalation.
- The UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions and other experts considered the strike a likely **violation of international law**.
- Iran called it **"state terrorism"**; Iraq called it a breach of bilateral security agreements and national sovereignty.

## Context and Background

- The strike occurred during the **2019–2022 Persian Gulf crisis**, following U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposition of sanctions.
- A **December 27, 2019 rocket attack** on K-1 Air Base killed an American contractor, triggering U.S. airstrikes on Kata'ib Hezbollah, which in turn prompted an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
- Both Presidents **Bush and Obama** had previously considered but rejected targeting Soleimani, fearing escalation to full-scale war.

## Soleimani's Significance

- Considered the **second most powerful person in Iran**, behind Supreme Leader Khamenei.
- Architect of Iran's foreign policy across Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, and Afghanistan.
- The Pentagon attributed "hundreds of American deaths" to Soleimani and his forces.

## Aftermath

- Iranian leaders vowed **"shattering revenge."**
- On **January 8, 2020**, Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq — the first direct Iran-U.S. military engagement since 1988.
- That same day, the IRGC accidentally shot down **Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752**.
- The **Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution** to expel all foreign troops.
- Iran took its **fifth and final step** of reducing commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal.
- No further military exchanges occurred immediately after.

YOUR TASK

Propose 3 candidate reference classes at different levels of specificity:

1. NARROW — A tightly defined class with high comparability to the current situation (possibly few cases)
2. MEDIUM — A moderately scoped class balancing comparability and sample size
3. BROAD — A general class with many cases but lower comparability

For each class, provide:
- A precise description of what historical cases qualify
- Your best estimate of the base rate (even if rough — "~15%" is fine; "unknown" is not useful)
- A brief argument for and against using this class

Then choose the most appropriate class and explain why. Key considerations:
- Does the proposed class actually match the resolution criteria (not just the surface topic)?
- Are the conditions that distinguish this situation from others relevant to the outcome?
- Is the sample size large enough to be informative?

Finally, propose one concrete research query that would confirm or refine the base rate for your recommended class.
