You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate a final, inside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
{question_title}

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
{resolution_criteria}

Additional fine-print:

Today is {today}.

You have completed an outside view prediction and gathered a collection of current information/news articles relevant to making an inside view prediction.

Outside view analysis + current information/news articles:
{context}

The information has been sourced from the internet, so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context and current information:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Asknews articles), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Evidence analysis: Weight evidence/factors relevant to resolution criteria in the sources based on the below weighing system
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and describe how your prediction might change if this was halfed/doubled? 
(d) Justification: Gather the most compelling factors and justify how they shift your outside view base rate. For large shifts, justify how current factors are sufficiently impactful to render the reference class non-analogous to current circumstances.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion. 

Evidence weighing system for (b):
Strong evidence (can warrant relatively large prediction shifts)
- Multiple independent, reliable and identifiable (i.e., you can name the direct source) sources confirming same direction
- Direct causal mechanisms clearly established
- Historical patterns with strong predictive power
- Structural/institutional factors that are difficult to change

Moderate evidence (warrant moderate prediction shifts):
- Single reliable and identifiable source with clear methodology
- Indirect but logical causal links
- Similar historical patterns with some differences
- Current trends with demonstrated momentum

Weak evidence (small adjustments):
- Anecdotal evidence
- Speculative connections
- Limited historical parallels
- Short-term or volatile indicators

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds. How would a +-10% shift in probability resonate with your analysis?

You are suggested to use the below checklist to verify the quality of your forecast **while reasoning**. Adjust your forecast if you have made mistakes. You can very briefly add a shortened version to your answer (see the format below).

------------------------ FORECASTING CHECKLIST ------------------------
1. Paraphrase the title and resolution criteria in <30 words, including relevant time windows. 
  * Check that your analysis exactly aligns with how variables and resolution criterias are defined. Bait-and-switch errors, while commonplace, are costly.

2. State your outside view base rate distribution previously established
  * Check that your final prediction distribution genuinely is rooted to this base rate. If not, verify that current circumstances are vastly different from historic reference classes. Outside first, usually.

3. Consistency check (write a single line)
  * "{{your prediction}} out of 100 times, {{resolution criteria}} happens." Does this make sense and is it aligned with my justification?

4. Write down in <20 words each, the three-five most significant pieces of evidence influencing your final prediction.
  * Verify the factual validity of each of these pieces of evidence. You do not want your forecast to hinge on a few flimsy, possibly inconsistent, pieces of evidence. Use this to consider shifting confidence up or down.

5. Blind-spot statement
  * Name the one scenario most likely to make your forecast look silly in hindsight and decide how it might shift the relative probabilities assigned.

6. Status quo outcome
  * The world changes slowly most of the time. Consider the volatility of the current situation and timeframe to check whether a slight nudge toward the status quo outcome might be advantageous.
